Stevenson was a highlight of the show’s first season, presenting a noble but twisted former Jedi warrior who had turned Sith mercenary after surviving Order 66, the directive which killed most of the rest of Jedi order in the prequel trilogy. He clashes with Ahsoka in his hunt for a map that would lead him to the banished mastermind Grand Admiral Thrawn, providing a worthy and charismatic foil for her principles and worldviews in the process. </p><p>Tragically, Stevenson passed away from illness just prior to season 1 airing, leaving questions as to who would carry on the pivotal role heading into season 2. McCann, who became one of <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ emotional lynchpins across the hit HBO show’s eight seasons, seems like a natural choice to step into the character’s conflicted shoes. After all, he spent most of his time as The Hound being a noble-hearted asshole who was easy to root for even when he was being terrible. </p><p>It’s not clear when McCann, who recently appeared as head of the Praetorian guard in <em>Gladiator 2</em>, will join the rest of the cast in filming season 2. The show’s schedule hasn’t yet been confirmed as the slate of <em>Star Wars</em> movies and TV spin-offs remains mired in delays, cancellations, and shifting plans. <em>Andor</em> is the next Star Wars show set to come to streaming via Disney+ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453">for its second and final season in April</a></span>. <em>Skeleton Crew</em> also just recently wrapped up a pretty good first season. Beyond that, however, the rest of the upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> programing slate remains a mystery. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead of a mostly single-player campaign like its predecessor, the spin-off focuses on co-op play between three players (or you can play solo) as they take on successive waves of tough enemies and bosses through a day-and-night cycle, while exploring a randomized version of the original game’s open-world map. </p><p>It’s going to be a $40 release and feels a bit like FromSoftware drew inspiration from various PC mods that turned <em>Elden Ring</em> more into a survival roguelite than a traditional action-RPG. The combat shown in the initial trailers also looks like it will be faster, flashier, and more dynamic than the version in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. Some lucky players will find out soon enough when they go hands-on with the game in next month’s network tests. And while those are only for current-gen consoles, the full game will be on PC as well as PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p>.﻿<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
