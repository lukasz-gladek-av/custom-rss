              <p>The holiday season is a great time to finally make the purchases that feel a little out of budget the rest of the year. If you’ve been eyeing a laptop upgrade for yourself, or want to gift one to someone who really needs to let go of their old machine, now is a great time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">The latest Lenovo IdeaPad in the stunning cosmic blue color, just dropped by 73% on Amazon, which brings its price down to $1,235</a>. It typically sits over $4,000, so this discount puts it in a much more affordable price range. This version comes packed with features that are great for professional use, and apart from the discount, you’re also getting an accessory kit thrown in for free with your purchase. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, as well, meaning you’re getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box. It ships before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to gift it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals, Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>For a little over $1,200, you’re getting a machine that flaunts a Cosmic Blue aluminum chassis that’s both refined and rugged. It gives off a premium feel, but meets military grade standards that protect it from everyday wear and tear well. There’s a stunning 16-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS touchscreen offering 300 nits of brightness and an anti-glare finish; both making for an immersive, yet comfortable viewing experience. Integrated Intel Graphics takes care of your late-night streaming sessions, online meetings, creative tasks, and even some gaming with ease, plus is paired with intelligent power allocation that maintains smooth visuals even when things get intense.</p>
<p>You’ll find a high-quality FHD 1080p IR camera with a physical privacy shutter for better video calls. It supports Windows Hello facial login, which adds another layer of security and lets you safely log in to the system even in dim lighting. Speaking of dimmer settings, the keyboard features a bright backlight that makes it easy to type long documents and work your way through projects 24/7; great for those of you who often find themselves pulling all-nighters.</p>



<p>As for power, you’ve got a muscular 10-core Intel Core 7 240H processor capable of hitting speeds up to 5.2 GHZ, and an on-chip AI Boost NPU rated at 18 TOPS. These make the machine more than capable of running resource-intensive programs and handling everyday workload without a hint of lag. The 32GB DDR5 RAM lets you multitask through busy days like a pro, while the massive 2TB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important content and files in a single place. The latter also offers much faster boot and load times, making the whole system snappier from the moment you power it on. What’s more, the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively, so you can always make necessary adjustments as your needs grow.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity comes from WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. Port-wise, it gets you dual USB-C (DP 1.4 + PD 3.0), dual USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (one Always On), HDMI 1.4b, microSD reader, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">And finally, the accessory kit includes a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, a screen wipe, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.</a> That’s everything you need to get started with work and play right away. Just be sure to snap the deal up fast, as it is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is out now, and it adds new Mega Evolutions, timed roguelike expeditions, and some more story to tie it all together. However, hidden in all this new stuff is the death of a dream that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans have nurtured for years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu’s two mega forms</span></a><span> may have been met with celebration from fans, but by finally giving the boy his due, Game Freak put the final nail in the coffin of Pikachu’s original final form, Gorochu.</span></p> <p><span>For those who don’t know, Gorochu was meant to be a third form in the Pikachu evolution line back in the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>days. This mysterious form never saw the light of day, but Game Freak has described </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/"><span>it in interviews</span></a><span>. While discussing the original Pikachu design process in 2018, artist Atsuko Nishida said that her original parameters for the electric mouse that would become the series’ mascot were that it had to be an electric-type monster that would evolve twice. Nishida designed Pikachu, Raichu, and Gorochu, but this third and final monster never made it into the final game. It had fangs and horns, and Nishida said it looked like “a god of thunder.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the same interview, artist Ken Sugimori says there was “nothing wrong” with Gorochu’s design, and </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>designer Koji Nishino said it was ultimately cut for game balance purposes and because there was only so much space on older Game Boy cartridges, so some monsters got cut along the way. In 2020 the original source code for these games leaked, which included <a href="https://tcrf.net/Development:Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok.C3.A9mon_Index_175">Gorochu’s back sprite</a>. This is the only “official” look we’ve gotten of the monster, but one of the </span><a href="https://x.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649"><span>most popular pieces of Gorochu fan art</span></a><span> captures </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>Sugimori’s style</span></a><span> so well that many fans believe it to be an in-house artistic rendition of the scrapped monster.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Raichu had an evolution named Gorochu, so I had a go at the design of it. Tried to keep consistent to the first generation of Pokemon's look and style. ⚡️ <a href="https://t.co/U4KrTr1DKW">pic.twitter.com/U4KrTr1DKW</a></p> <p>— VivinkArt (@VivinkArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>All this mystique has had fans asking for Game Freak to bring Gorochu back and make the Pikachu line the first “four-stage” monster, now that </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver </span></i><span>added Pichu, a pre-evolution to Pikachu. However, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC may have killed this dream, as it gives </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu two Mega forms</span></a><span>. As AZ lays out in the main game, Mega Evolution is only possible if a Pokémon has reached its final stage of Evolution. This isn’t just a fan assumption, and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s endgame makes a point of driving this home by allowing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>AZ’s Floette</span></a><span>, which was unable to evolve due to its exposure to the Ultimate Weapon thousands of years prior, to Mega Evolve.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that Raichu is out here doing what only fully evolved Pokémon can do, Gorochu seems to be officially dead, but both of its Mega designs have some elements that feel like echoes of Gorochu. Both forms have fangs, and the Y variant has jackalope-style horns. The X form also flies around like he’s Superman, and that’s giving “god of thunder” in my eyes.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We’ll have a full review of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>in the coming days.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/evo-2026-marvel-tokon-mortal-kombat-lineup-2000652123</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fighting game lineup for Evo 2026 has been revealed and there’s a notable absence: <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></a>. Just three years after it launched, the content-complete sequel is not getting invited back to the world’s biggest annual fighting game event. Johnny Cage and Subzero will instead be making way for <a href="https://x.com/InvincibleVS/status/1996640662255816844"><em>Invincible Vs</em></a> and the <em>League of Legends</em> fighter <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a>.</p> <p>The Evolution Championship Series, another piece of gaming culture that was recently sold in part <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">to Saudi Arabia</a>, brings fighting game pros and fans to Las Vegas every summer for several days of <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2025-viral-moment-fatal-fury-meme-kog-go1-2000614619">big stage face-offs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410">passion-fueled side-tournaments</a>. While<em> Street Fighter</em> remains king, other fighting games vie for top billing and occasionally circulate out of the main event. Despite having one of the wildest grassroots fandoms around, Nintendo’s <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-ultimate-melee-nintendo-switch-evo-2022-sony-1848598680">was a no-show</a> at Evo 2022 back when the event was owned by competitor Sony.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EVO Las Vegas 2026 lineup:<br>-SF6<br>-Tekken 8<br>-Fatal Fury CotW<br>-Under Night In-Birth Sys:Celes<br>-Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising<br>-Rivals of Aether 2<br>-2XKO<br>-Guilty Gear Strive<br>-BlazBlue Centralfiction<br>-Virtua Fighter 5 REVO World Stage<br>-Vampire Savior<br>-Invincible Vs <a href="https://t.co/Ar5In2RCNn">pic.twitter.com/Ar5In2RCNn</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1998566054268907575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This year’s big changes see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> dropped from the lineup while games like <em>BlazBlue Centralfiction</em>, released a decade ago, get called back up to the majors. Some fans are wondering if it will be a wake-up call for NetherRealms, whose reboot of the franchise wasn’t bad but never quite hit the “we’re so back” vibes many were hoping for.</p>

 <p>Other notable swap-ins include the new <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which despite some issues and a content-lite launch has marshaled a passionate community around it, and <em>Rivals of Aether II</em>, the 2024 2D platform fighter that some fans argue still feels like an Early Access sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em> is also MIA</h2> <p>Even more notable than what was ditched is what wasn’t added. The Sony-published comic book fighting game <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384"><em>Marvel Tōkon</em></a> has a 2026 release window but won’t be on tap for Evo 2026. That suggests the heir apparent to <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> won’t be out until late in the year. <em>Marvel</em> <em>Tōkon</em> feels like the only recent new fighting game reveal to break through to a more casual audience and gin up excitement outside of the hardcore crowd, so it would have been a neat pick-up for next year’s event.</p> <p>Developer Arc System Works has been using Evo to reveal new bits about the 4v4 fighting game, so it seems likely it’ll still be involved with the tournament series in some way, just not as an esport. The game’s continued to run closed betas that have garnered lots of positive buzz so far. Hopefully it doesn’t get delayed to 2027.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-nintendo-asus-rog-xbox-ally-drops-to-a-record-low-despite-being-a-new-release-with-3-months-of-xbox-game-pass-premium-included-2000651842</link>
            <guid>1378357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="517">As much as some of us wish for an official handheld Xbox console, I wouldn’t recommending holding your breath. However, Asus is giving us something very close. In partnership with Microsoft, Asus has updated the ROG Ally, adding official Xbox branding. Enter the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, a new handheld gaming device aimed to rival the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/">Released less than two months ago, the device is already seeing a solid discount. Originally priced at $600, it’s now 18% off, dropping to $490—a savings of $110 this soon after launch.</a></p>
<p data-start="519" data-end="803">So what makes this model stand out from the previous Asus ROG Ally? For starters, it now features an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and runs on a redesigned Windows OS, both of which promise to deliver a smoother, more seamless experience both while gaming and navigating the interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="805" data-end="837"><strong data-start="805" data-end="837">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</strong></h2>
<p data-start="839" data-end="1315">With the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, your entire PC game library is at your fingertips, and you can boot straight into them from the new Xbox App UI. This handheld lets you stream Xbox games from your console or from Microsoft’s cloud service, and the Xbox Game Bar can be accessed with a press of the dedicated Xbox button on the left side. Beyond just Xbox titles, the device supports Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other platforms, so you’re not limited to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1317" data-end="1557">In terms of hardware, the ROG Xbox Ally comes equipped with 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD. If that storage doesn’t quite cut it for your game library, the storage is upgradeable, giving you room to expand as needed.</p>


<p data-start="1559" data-end="2051">The device features a 7-inch display with 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, putting it on par with other high-end handhelds like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 lbs, it’s roughly the same weight too. The redesigned chassis pulls inspiration from the Xbox wireless core controllers, with contoured grips for better comfort during long gaming sessions. You can play on the go or connect to your TV via the dual USB-C ports, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">To keep you gaming longer, the handheld includes a 60Wh battery that can recharge quickly. Just half an hour of charging gets you back up to 50% battery life.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">With these upgrades, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally series is shaping up to be a strong contender in the portable gaming market, offering versatility, performance, and a solid gaming experience. And right now, it’s down $110 for the holiday season.</p>
<p data-start="2233" data-end="2544">For those seeking more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is also available, offering an upgraded processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery for even longer playtime, making it a solid option for those who want a premium handheld experience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-12-in-1-docking-station-returns-at-black-friday-pricing-after-selling-out-doubles-as-a-monitor-stand-2000651854</link>
            <guid>1378315</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re well into December now. If you still haven’t secured all your gifts for the holidays, the clock’s a-tickin’. Though, you’re not out of luck just yet. We’re well past the big deals days of the season like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but some deals are still holding strong so you can save big.</p>
<p>Take a moment to check out this Anker USB-C docking station, a device that does far more than simply expand the number of ports available on your computer. Anker designed it to function as both a powerful connectivity hub and a practical monitor stand, giving you two essential workspace upgrades in a single piece of equipment.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/"> At the moment, Amazon is still offering a notable 32% discount, dropping the usual $250 price tag down to about $170</a> — a savings of roughly $80 for anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="543" data-end="1179">This model is a 12-in-1 docking station intended to transform a cluttered, cable-ridden desk into a space that feels polished, intentional, and comfortable to work at for long stretches. Its shelf-style construction is sturdy enough to support your external monitor, raising it just high enough to improve your viewing angle while simultaneously freeing up valuable desk real estate. Beneath the stand, there’s plenty of room to slide your keyboard out of the way when it’s not needed—ideal for keeping things tidy when stepping away from your desk or when you want extra space for meals or note-taking.</p>
<p data-start="1181" data-end="1512">Even a slight elevation of your monitor can have real benefits for your posture. By bringing the screen closer to eye level, the stand reduces the temptation to lean forward or slouch, encouraging a more ergonomic sitting position. This can help lessen neck and shoulder tension, especially for those who spend hours at a computer.</p>


<h2>Charge Everything at Once</h2>
<p data-start="1514" data-end="2163">Along the right side of the unit, Anker incorporated an array of ports and connectors that should satisfy anyone who regularly juggles multiple accessories. The Anker 675 includes a 100W-max USB-C upstream port for powering and linking your laptop, three USB-A ports, two additional USB-C ports, a full-size SD card slot, a MicroSD slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, an ethernet port for wired internet, and an HDMI output capable of supporting 4K resolution at 60Hz. Whether you need to transfer files, plug in peripherals, or connect an external display, the station provides instinctive access to almost every type of connection you might need.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2522">On the top surface, you’ll find a built-in wireless charging pad. This allows you to place your smartphone on the dock and have it recharge while you work, eliminating the need to keep an extra charging cable on your desk. The USB-A and USB-C ports each support data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is especially handy for moving large files quickly.</p>
<p data-start="2524" data-end="3047" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Underneath the stand is a spacious cable-management compartment designed to hide excess cords and keep your workspace looking clean and intentional. The entire structure is built from durable aircraft-grade aluminum, giving it a premium feel and solid longevity. Anti-slip silicone pads on the feet prevent shifting or wobbling. With dimensions of 21.26 inches by 8.66 inches by 3.54 inches, the station is broad enough to accommodate most monitors currently on the market while still fitting comfortably on standard desks.</p>

<p>However, Roborock still produces more affordable models that deliver excellent cleaning performance without the premium price tag, and the Q7 M5+ represents this value-focused approach perfectly: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">Amazon has dropped this model to a record low of $219, down from its usual $359</a>, which makes premium automated cleaning accessible at a price that competes with basic robot vacuums offering far fewer features.</p>

<h2>Powerful Suction</h2>
<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is strong enough to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and pick up pet hair that other vacuums leave behind: This vacuum has a lot of suction power, similar to what you would get from many upright vacuums which means that the robot doesn’t just move dirt around but it actually lifts it up and takes it away. The robot makes several passes over high-traffic areas and pulls dirt from deep within the pile where it builds up over time. This strong suction is especially good for carpets.</p>



<p>The dual anti-tangle system solves the most annoying problem with robot vacuums: hair getting stuck in the brushes and needing to be removed by hand. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> actively cuts and channels hair into the dustbin instead of letting it wind around the roller. The <strong>side brush has a zero-tangle structure</strong> that works even in homes with long-haired pets or family members. This design lets you use the vacuum every day without having to flip it over and cut away matted hair every few days.</p>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus station lets the robot empty itself, so it can run for 7 to 9 weeks</strong> without needing any help: The 2.7-liter dust bag collects dirt from dozens of cleaning cycles and after each cleaning session, the robot automatically goes back to the dock to empty its dustbin. Then it goes back out to finish its scheduled tasks. You can almost forget about the vacuum for almost two months because of this longer maintenance period.</p>



<p><em>PreciSense</em> LiDAR navigation makes <strong>detailed maps of your home by bouncing laser beams off of walls</strong> and furniture to measure distances with millimeter accuracy. The robot uses these maps to figure out the best ways to clean that cover every area that can be reached without going over the same spot more than once which lets it finish jobs faster than robots that just bump around. With multi-floor mapping, the vacuum can learn the layout of each level in your home and automatically load the right map for the floor it’s on. You can set up no-go zones around pet bowls, fragile furniture, or places where cables might get caught in the brushes. This will keep the robot from getting into trouble without having to use physical barrier tape.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid vacuum and mop feature</strong> lets you remove dry debris and mop up wet areas in one pass: You can change the water flow from light dampening for hardwood to more aggressive mopping for tile and laminate. The <em>VibraRise 2.0</em> technology adds sound vibrations to the mop pad to help it remove stains better and it also automatically lifts the mop when the robot sees carpet, so the pads don’t soak your rugs.</p>
<p>In a market where basic models without docking stations often cost more, paying $219 for a robot vacuum that can empty itself and has 10,000Pa suction is a great deal. Roborock’s usual price of $359 already made this model a good deal, but the 39% discount makes it an impulse buy for families who are tired of vacuuming every day.</p>
