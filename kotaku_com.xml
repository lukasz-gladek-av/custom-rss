              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has no business being as funny as it is. Whether I‚Äôm enjoying the absurdity of its main cast‚Äôs antics or passing by an NPC who says something so out of pocket I have to do a double take at their speech bubble, I‚Äôm getting plenty of chuckles out of my time in Lumiose City. The citizens of the Paris-inspired setting seem to be </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-secret-npc-dialogue-sinister/"><span>going through it</span></a><span>, and it means that you‚Äôll find a lot of odd one-liners popping up as you run through the city.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There‚Äôs much to be said about whether or not Lumiose City feels ‚Äúalive‚Äù in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>small map‚Äôs</span></a><span> lack of distinct districts and visual identity has come under fire since the RPG launched last week. Still, you can‚Äôt deny that its people have character. The main cast of Z-A Royale participants and members of Team MZ are some of the most memorable characters Game Freak has put in one of these games. While the nameless denizens of Lumiose City you encounter aren‚Äôt decked out in glitz and glamour like the members of the main cast, they make the most of their screentime, like that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/30/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-got-upstaged-by-a-swivel-eyed-extra"><span>one lady in the background of </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the brief quips you‚Äôll see while running around actually drop surprisingly insightful tidbits, like revealing what‚Äôs happened to characters from </span><i><span>Pok√©mon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Others are just the ramblings of mad people at their wits‚Äô end, who can‚Äôt be bothered to mask their discontent in front of a group of young adults tirelessly trying to save the city. Without further ado, here are some of the best, funniest, and most unsettling quotes I‚Äôve seen both online and in my own playthrough.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pikmin-5-free-update-sequel-switch-2-miyamoto-2000638244</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-being-real-weird-about-pikmin-all-of-a-sudden.1331944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has a history of making weird announcements out of the blue. Remember last year‚Äôs alarm clock? But even in its current chaotic era of tweeting out game reveals and doing hour-long follow-up livestreams for games like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, Wednesday‚Äôs <em>Pikmin 4</em> announcement is low-key bizarre.</p> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker revealed its 2023 strategy adventure game will be getting a free update two years later. But not for the newly released Switch 2. Instead, <em>Pikmin 4</em> will get new content in November for the original Switch version. That game can be played on the new hardware, obviously, but an official Switch 2 upgrade remains nowhere in sight. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>The meat of the update revolves around new cross-functionality between <em>Pikmin 4</em> and <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, the augmented-reality mobile spin-off by the creators of <em>Pok√©mon Go</em>. Decor Pikmin, which wear funny outfits and were previously only available in <em>Bloom</em>, can now be found in <em>Pikmin 4</em> and transferred back and forth between both games. Meanwhile, <em>Pikmin 4</em>‚Äòs Ice Pikmin will be joining <em>Bloom</em> for the first time to mark that game‚Äôs fourth anniversary.</p>

  <p>The rest of the update includes a camera mode for <em>Pikmin 4</em> and new difficulty settings to make the game easier or more challenging. There‚Äôs also now a free demo for the game on the eShop. <em>Pikmin 4</em> sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/231107_4e.pdf">over 2.5 million copies</a>, making it the best-selling game in the franchise that began back on the GameCube, but still far from one of the platform‚Äôs bigger first-party sellers.</p>

 <p>So why <em>Pikmin</em>? Why now? And why on the original Switch? Nintendo hasn‚Äôt shied away from making DLC and packaging it with paid ‚Äúnext-gen upgrades‚Äù to push sales of older Switch games on the new hardware. At the same time, this seems unlikely to feed into any meaningful holiday resurgence in<em> Pikmin 4</em> for the original console, with the update wedged in-between <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p>

 <h2>Is Nintendo laying the groundwork for <em>Pikmin 5</em> or something completely different?</h2> <p>There‚Äôs also the extra weirdness with this update coming just after Nintendo released a couple of Pixar-like <em>Pikmin</em> shorts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pikmin-short-animated-film-mario-zelda-app-2000633651">It claims</a> those were tests to prove out the capabilities of its new internal Nintendo Pictures team, but the company rarely does random one-offs on a whim. Could this all be laying the groundwork for Nintendo‚Äôs next <em>Pikmin</em> project? And will that be a full-fledged <em>Pikmin </em>sequel, a <em>Pikmin</em>-centric movie or TV series, or a more unorthodox venture in the toy or theme park realm?</p>

 <p>There‚Äôs also the Shigeru Miyamoto factor. The famed Nintendo developer created the <em>Pikmin</em> franchise and it clearly lives near and dear to his heart. Would <em>Pikmin 4</em> have even happened without him pushing for it? He told press it was close to completion back in 2015, only for it to lay dormant until it was suddenly re-revealed in 2022 and released the following year.</p>

 <p><em>Pikmin 4</em> is also notable among Nintendo‚Äôs first-party projects for being made in Unreal Engine 4. There‚Äôs also that mysterious MMO playtest Nintendo performed exactly a year ago this week. It included <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">world-crafting mechanics and user-generated content references</a> that suggested things like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> were possible inspirations.</p> <p>Could Nintendo be prepping a <em>Pikmin</em> crossover with <em>Fortnite</em>? Will the next <em>Pikmin</em> game be Nintendo‚Äôs ambitious take on the survival crafting MMO genre? Will Miyamoto return to development to make it the last game he ever directs? Or is Nintendo just throwing hardcore <em>Pikmin 4</em> stans one last bone before the franchise goes dark for another decade?</p>
