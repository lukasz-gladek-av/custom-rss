              <p>Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <em>Halo</em> meme as an ICE recruitment ad, likening immigrants to violent aliens. Microsoft has declined to comment on the twisted rhetoric, but some of the franchise’s former developers voiced their thoughts.</p> <p>The meme <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">posted on X on October 27</a> shows Master Chief and a fellow Spartan in a Warthog with a call to “DESTROY THE FLOOD.” It was a reference to an alien species that serves as one of the sci-fi shooter’s main antagonists; an infectious superorganism that consumes and destroys everything it touches. “Finishing this fight,” wrote DHS above the recruitment ad.</p>

 <p>In an interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">with <em>Game File</em></a>, <em>Halo c</em>o-creator Marcus Lehto called the post “absolutely abhorrent” and added, “It really makes me sick seeing<em> Halo</em> co-opted like this.” Franchise veteran&nbsp;Jamie Griesemer, who was lead designer on both <em>Halo 2</em> and <em>Halo 3</em>, was similarly outraged.</p>

 <p>“Using <em>Halo</em> imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every <em>Halo</em> fan, regardless of political orientation,” he told <em>Game File</em>. “I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.“</p>

 <p>Pushing back against some fans claiming the original <em>Halo</em> games were a post-9/11 parable for fighting an army of invading religious zealots, Griesemer said it wasn’t an allegory for any specific religion or political movement. “The Prophets are not Popes, the Grunts are not Wahhabis, and the Flood are definitely not illegal immigrants,” he told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><em>Game File</em></a>. “The Master Chief is not a Christ figure and Cortana is not the Virgin Mary, I guess?”</p> <p><em>Halo</em>‘s collision with the Trump administration’s anti-immigration crackdown, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2025/10/28/chicago-s-children-are-getting-caught-chaos-immigration-crackdowns">which includes “lawless” ICE raids in cities like Chicago</a>, comes as Microsoft is trying to get fans hyped for a remake of the original game coming next year that will also serve as the franchise’s debut on PlayStation. At the same time, the tech giant is pledging support for Trump’s White House demolition and the building of a new ballroom as it seemingly tries to curry favor for government contracts and regulatory approvals related to its spiraling AI investments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6‘s New Map Is Very Bad]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598">On October 28,<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s latest update</a>&nbsp;added Blackwell Fields, a new map, to the online FPS. This should be an exciting time for fans. However, Blackwell Fields is a very small, mostly empty map that isn’t much fun to play. And the community isn’t happy about it.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">I got a chance to go hands-on with Blackwell Fields</a> before it was added to the game as part of today’s larger season one update, which also added a new battle royale mode and battle pass system. And after playing a few matches on it back then, I was worried. Now having checked it out in the full game and watched others play it, I’m here to report that Blackwell Fields is one of <em>BF6</em>‘s worst maps yet.</p>

  <p>It’s an odd duck of a map that feels too big and empty when you’re running around on foot, but feels too small when you’re trying to use vehicles. Snipers are king on this map and will quickly take you out the moment you spawn. Blackwell Fields also lacks a lot of interesting spaces in which to fight, mostly just being an oil field with some hills to use as cover. Not great. Flying around the map is a pain, too, as it’s so small you’ll quickly hit the out-of-bounds and be forced to turn around. (Assuming you don’t just get shot down instantly, more on that in a moment.) And to top it all off, it’s just kind of a bleh-looking map with no real distinctive features or interesting visual theming. Brownish hills, some oil drills, a few dirt roads, and a handful of buildings. Enjoy!</p>

 <p>On the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/man_this_is_the_worst_map_in_bf_history_i_cant/">reactions</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi63vz/these_boundaries_make_this_map_unnecessarily_small/">the new map</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi73om/blackwell_fields_is_another_clusterfuck_lane/">ranged from “This isn’t good”</a> to “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8c4u/the_new_map_doesnt_bring_me_confidence_to_the/">This is very, very bad.</a>” Players aren’t happy with how small the map is and its oddly constrictive boundaries. People are also already tired of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi6sfk/a_quick_glance_at_the_new_map/">getting sniped over and over again</a> when spawning on squadmates, as the map lacks substantial cover.</p>

   <p>But perhaps the worst part of Blackwell Fields is that the main team bases are too damn close to each other. Players are reporting that when trying to take off in a jet at their own base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi882b/pax_armata_jets_can_be_locked_on_without_taking/">the other team’s AA guns</a>, located in the opposite base, can be used to destroy the aircraft. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/">Helis aren’t safe from this issue, either</a>. For many, it means that aircraft are effectively worthless on the map in its current state. Yikes! Further upsetting players is the fact that the new free battle royale spin-off, Redsec, features a massive map. But the paid game got such a tiny new map.</p> <p>Can Blackwell Fields be saved? Maybe. Opening it up would help, for sure, and maybe adding some more cover would, too. But really, I think EA should have just released the other new map arriving later this season, Eastwood, which is bigger and better in every way than Blackwell Fields. Unfortunately, unless something changes, that map won’t be added until a later update in November.</p>
