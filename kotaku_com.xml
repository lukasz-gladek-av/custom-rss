              <p><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale might not have paid off all the various story threads this season set up, but it did tease a location rarely seen in the games and featured the reveal of something big returning from <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>. Spoilers below for the season in general and the finale episode in particular. If you haven’t watched it yet and don’t want to be spoiled, don’t keep scrolling!</p>  <p>After two seasons of following the Ghoul as he searched for his family, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-margot-enclave-cooper-janey-2000665411"><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale</a> finally brings him face to face with…their empty cryopods hidden deep in a secret Vault below Mr. House’s Lucky 38 Casino. Dang. But inside his wife’s tube is a postcard for Colorado, giving him hope that his family is still alive in the midwestern state.</p>

 <p>So off he goes on a new quest to hopefully find his wife and daughter after a heck of a 200 years. During the credits, a billboard reinforces the idea that next season will, at least partially, be set in Colorado. What do we know about Colorado in the <em>Fallout</em> universe, and what can we expect?</p> <h2>Colorado In The <em>Fallout</em> Universe</h2> <p>Colorado is a state that has been mentioned a few times in past games and <em>Fallout</em> media, but has rarely played a big role. It, like most of the rest of the United States in <em>Fallout</em>, was mostly wiped out by the nuclear bombs dropped during the Great War. Colorado’s biggest appearance in the games thus far happened in<em> Fallout Tactics</em>, a game that isn’t wholly canon, but parts of it might be (it’s weird). In that 2001 tactical turn-based RPG spin-off, we are introduced to Vault 0.</p>

 <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_0">Vault 0</a> is set in an expanded version of the real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_Complex#Video_games">Cheyenne Mountain Complex</a>, a large underground U.S. military bunker designed to survive nuclear war and other massive attacks. Exactly what happens in <em>Fallout Tactics</em> isn’t really important, but Vault 0 and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex could play a part in season three. We know the Enclave is still around, and it would make sense for them to hole up in something like that to hide away from the rest of the wasteland.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, as pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/fallout-season-3-location/">PC Gamer</a>,</em> in the lead-up to <em>Fallout</em> season one, Amazon posted an hour-long video about the opening of Vault 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/o1YhcviJ7IU?t=761">And during the stream, an announcer says this</a>: “Unless you’re the President of the United States or something like that, and you have a mountain in Colorado to go under and direct the events of the world.” And who did Cooper Howard run into in this season and hand off the Cold Fusion capsule to? The president. I suspect Vault 0 or a version of it will play a role in season three.</p> <p>One other interesting thing to note about Colorado is that the original version of <em>Fallout 3</em> that was being developed by Black Isle Studios before it was canceled was going to be partially set in Colorado. Fitting that Colorado will likely play a big role in season three of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show, given that it was previously featured in both the third <em>Fallout</em> game ever made (<em>Tactics</em>) and the original <em>Fallout 3</em> (Project Van Buren).</p>

 <h2>That Other Big (Wink) Tease</h2> <p>After all the credits, Amazon included a post-credits teaser scene featuring Elder Cleric Quintus and Dane back at the Brotherhood’s Area 51 base we saw earlier in the season. Chaos is continuing there after Maximus took off with the Cold Fusion capsule. Anyway, Dane brings Quintus a scroll. He tells the scribe that Quintus the Unifier is no more. Instead, he is now Quintus the Destroyer and unrolls the scroll to reveal a blueprint for Liberty Prime.</p> <p>We technically saw what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcvxny/surprised_no_one_is_mentioning_this/">appears to be Liberty Prime earlier this season</a> in a photo featuring Mr. House’s body double. But this is the giant democracy-defending robot’s first real appearance in the show. Or, well, he appears as a blueprint schematic. Close enough.</p> <p>This seems to be a new version of the big robot, named Liberty Prime Alpha, and is different from the mech that first appeared in <em>Fallout 3</em> and later in <em>Fallout 4</em>. I’m not yet convinced this ragtag chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel is going to be able to create its own Liberty Prime. Perhaps it’s buried away in Area 51? We’ll have to wait until season three to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On January 29, <em>Ashes of Creation</em> maker Intrepid Studios was promising big updates to the recently launched, long-awaited fantasy Steam MMO. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ashes-creation-refund-kickstarter-steam-mmo-layoffs-2000665006">Less than a week later</a>, the game has been review-bombed, removed from Valve’s storefront, and seen all of its developers suddenly fired, according to a new post from the studio’s communications director.</p> <p><span>“I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity,” Intrepid Studios head of marketing Margaret Krohn <a href="https://x.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819">wrote on X</a> on Tuesday. “Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect. What I can share is what I experienced. On January 28, toward the end of the workday, I was informed that we would be laying off 100 developers. I was devastated – these are hardworking people who were going to lose their jobs. Still, I believed it was something we could face together and find a path forward from.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity.</p> <p>Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect.

But according to Krohn, the mass firings at the studio were already moving forward. She said she received confirmation of which members of her team would be laid off by the end of day on January 29, and the remaining employees began working on “ways to move forward” the following day. But by January 31, it became clear that no one at the studio was safe.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“On January 31, we were all informed via a confusing email that we would be laid off, along with a WARN notice,” she wrote. “It is still shocking. The entire studio gathered to try to understand what had happened and what it meant for our future. In the end, none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60 days notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed.”</span></p>

 <p>That’s the same day that <em>Ashes of Creation</em> director Steven Sharif announced on Discord he was no longer in control of the company and was resigning in protest.&nbsp;“I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,” he wrote on January 31. “Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665514"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665514">Valve / Intrepid Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That was the first public mention of the turmoil Intrepid was facing and it immediately ricocheted across Steam, where<em> Ashes of Creation</em> entered Early Access back in December, and Kickstarter, where backers raised $3.2 million to bring the MMORPG to market starting way back in 2017. The game was quickly review-bombed on Valve’s storefront with warnings to other players to stay away of what soon might become a dead game, while backers on Kickstarter demanded refunds over the game never hitting a proper 1.0 launch. It’s since been removed from sale completely on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“What matters most to me now are the people – both the players and developers,” Krohn wrote today. “To the players: the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you <em>Ashes of Creation</em>. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it. To my colleagues: this team is truly a family. The culture we built together is something I have never experienced anywhere else. In the midst of heartbreak and uncertainty, we have come together to review resumes, help with portfolios, share job leads, and support one another emotionally.”</span></p>

 <p>As of now, it’s unclear who remains in control of Intrepid Studios as a company, which is based out of San Diego, or what will happen to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>, whose potential for a comeback seems increasingly unlikely. Who funded the game’s development? How did the studio’s finances suddenly get wiped out overnight? And what recourse do developers who worked on it have to be made whole? <em>Kotaku</em> tried reaching out to the studio’s email address but we haven’t heard back. Sharif declined to comment before clearing it with his legal counsel.</p> <p>When we reached out to <span> Krohn she responded with the following: “I made my statement. I can’t really talk more than that, I think I might have even said too much as is, but people need to know what happened.”<br> </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-on-track-for-2027-launch-says-amd-ceo-2000665496</link>
            <guid>1424758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su shared some interesting information about two upcoming video game devices, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve’s Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-xbox-microsoft-phil-spencer-new-console-1851700253">Xbox’s next-gen console</a>, both of which are powered by her company’s chips.</p> <p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/amd-spills-the-beans-on-next-gen-xbox-launching-in-2027/">As reported by <em>Gamesbeat</em></a> on February 3, Su shared some new info about when to expect Valve’s upcoming console-like PC gaming box, the Steam Machine, and further teased a possible launch window for Microsoft’s previously confirmed-to-be-in-development next-generation Xbox.</p> <p>“From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year,” claimed Su in prepared remarks ahead of a financial call.&nbsp; “And development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom [System on Chip] is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t a confirmation that the next Xbox will launch in 2027, but Su did point out that both the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will be entering their seventh year on the market at that point, and that’s a good time for a refresh.</p> <p>Valve’s Steam Machine has a confirmed release date of 2026, but nothing any more specific. Valve says the Steam hardware family will expand in early 2026, but didn’t specify if that was all three recently announced devices, just one, or some other combo like the VR headset and new controller. Su’s comments seem to indicate that Valve could start selling and shipping Steam Machines to customers within the next few months. Meanwhile, we’ve known for some time that Microsoft is trying to get the next Xbox out <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">around 2027</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-game-pass-gen-10-release-date-microsoft-1850849528">possibly 2028</a>. Microsoft execs have also teased that the next-gen Xbox will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">a “very premium, very high-end” device</a>, so it doesn’t sound cheap.</p>

 <h2>The next generation of game consoles will be expensive</h2> <p>While Su didn’t talk about prices, it’s pretty clear to anyone paying attention that any video game consoles or console-like devices arriving in the near future are going to cost quite a bit. President Trump’s tariffs have led to increased prices on many goods made overseas. Meanwhile, AI hyperscalers and tech giants are <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">scooping up more and more PC parts, like RAM and GPUs</a>, to help build out massive AI data centers. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">This has led to memory prices skyrocketing</a>, and Nvidia is even reportedly looking to start making old GPUs again as the parts needed to make newer cards are routed toward making high-end cards for data centers.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946">Existing consoles, like the Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Xbox Series X/S,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">could also see price increases</a> in the future due to memory shortages and the rising cost of PC parts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">Even AMD’s cheaper GPUs are reportedly going to see price increases</a>. Meanwhile, when we’ve seen new gaming-adjacent tech launch in the last 12 months, the prices have been high, as in the case of Xbox and ROG’s handheld PC which <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">costs $1,000.</a> And it looks like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine will possibly cost $800 to $1000</a> or more when it launches later this year.</p> <p>What does all of this mean for the PlayStation 6 and next Xbox? It means you probably need to start saving now if you want to afford one of these devices when they launch in the next 24 months or so. And maybe be prepared to go without one for a while, as it’s likely there will be shortages for a long time following either console’s future launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Doesn’t Mean The End Of GTA Online: ‘We’ll Continue To Support It’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gta-online-support-2027-november-post-launch-take-two-ceo-strauss-2000665489</link>
            <guid>1424722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During today’s Take-Two Interactive quarterly financial call, the CEO of Rockstar’s parent company was asked about the future of <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> after the release of <em>G<a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">rand Theft Auto 6</a> </em>in November. And he seemed pretty confident that the popular multiplayer game would keep receiving updates into 2027.</p> <p><em>GTA Online</em> first launched all the way back in October 2013 on Xbox 360 and PS3. It has since received hundreds of updates and expansions and been ported to many other consoles, where it continues to be incredibly popular and makes Take-Two a lot of money. So it’s not surprising that Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed the gravy train isn’t likely to shut down after <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780"><em>GTA 6</em>‘s multiplayer mode arrives,</a> presumably, later this year.</p>

 <p><span>“Look, Rockstar Games is the locus of information about, you know, where the titles go content and marketing, and generally, we have a pretty light touch when we talk about the label’s creative activities,” said Zelnick during Tuesday’s earnings call. </span><span>“At the same time, I have every reason to believe we’ll continue to support </span><i><span>GTA Online. </span></i><span>There’s a great community that loves it, that stays engaged. And again in this quarter, Rockstar has shown that when you deliver great additional content, despite how long [</span><i><span>GTA Online</span></i><span>] has been at market, people show up.”</span></p> <p>Back in 2025, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick told <em>IGN</em></a> that Take-Two supports games as long as people are still playing them.</p>

 <p>“As an example, we launched <em>NBA 2K Online</em> in China, I think originally in 2012, if I’m not mistaken,” Zelnick told the outlet last year. “And then we launched <em>NBA 2K Online 2</em> in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset <em>Online 1</em>. They both are still in the market, and they serve consumers, and they’re alive, and we have this massive audience. So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p>

 <p>That last part is key. Take-Two and Rockstar Games are more than happy to keep making content and updating old games, as long as there are enough people playing those games and spending money in them to financially justify it. And, at least for now, <em>GTA Online</em> definitely seems to qualify; <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/032e3067-32cd-4c82-b4dd-2bd20a153a6a">it saw a 27-percent increase in consumer spending last quarter</a>, according to Take-Two. When you have a money-printing machine, well, it’s hard to convince anybody to turn it off.</p>

              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>’s first-person perspective was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-first-person-rpg-1826775323"><span>revealed</span></a><span> back in 2018, quite a few fans were worried. For CD Projekt Red enthusiasts who were used to staring at the back of Geralt’s gorgeous little ponytail all day in </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> and for others who just wanted to be able to see their painstaking customizations of protagonist V, the decision sparked its fair share of skepticism. However, it ended up working out pretty well, and now one of the game’s leads has taken to social media to explain why.</span></p> <p><span>On Sunday, Igor Sarzyński, who worked as </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Director before being bumped up to Creative Director for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, elaborated on the team’s decision to use a first-person perspective in </span><i><span>2077 </span></i><span>via </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mdsstc5lpk22"><span>a thread on Bluesky</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Purely from narrative design pov I think subjective FPP [first-person perspective] works well with ‘</span><i><span>77</span></i><span> story, genre and world. You’re a mind trapped in a decaying body with only means of leaving it being through technological consciousness processing,” he wrote (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/cyberpunk-2-lead-says-first-person-pov-was-better-for-cyberpunk-2077-as-third-person-is-for-more-defined-characters-like-the-witcher-3s-geralt-and-god-of-wars-kratos/"><i><span>Games Radar</span></i></a><span>).</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nkkdls4c67lfagg735y7ywpq/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdsstc5lpk22" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidsrjfslaek5rghf5w24nehi35lxqnu22rim5xbxljyb7blmba3na"> <p lang="en">Purely from narrative design pov I think subjective FPP works well with '77 story, genre and world.

Third-person perspective, he feels, “is better for more defined characters – Geralt, Kratos, Ellie – where you play-replay someone else’s story. FPP lends itself to more avatar-like player characters. V exists somewhere in the middle of this spectrum but for reasons stated above ^ i feel FPP was better for </span><i><span>‘77</span></i><span>.”</span></p>

 <p><span>He also added that the camera lets the game’s visions of “digital ghost” Johnny Silverhand, which he described as a “thing existing only in your subjective perception – rather than both of you being seen equally by an external, objective TPP cam,” feel more immersive.</span></p>

              <p>A strange rumor that popped up online last month claimed that, to avoid early leaks, Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive were going to delay the physical release of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>and the game would only launch digitally. That’s not the case.</p> <p>On February 3, as part of Take-Two’s Q3 fiscal results, the company’s longtime CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told <em>Variety</em></a> bluntly that the online rumors swirling around <em>GTA 6</em>‘s physical launch were nothing to worry about.</p> <p>“That’s not the plan,” Zelnick told the outlet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">This odd rumor popped up in January</a> after a Polish site reported that a Rockstar insider had heard that <em>GTA 6′</em>s physical and digital releases could be split up. Once the rumor popped up in January, it quickly spread and was reported by sites like <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-physical-release-could-be-delayed-to-2027-because-of-leaks-3309757/"><em>Dexerto</em></a> and was posted across places like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Here is the original, now debunked, claim:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We are getting more and more information that the box version will not be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks.”</p></blockquote> <p>However, <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to verify the rumor with any of its sources. And to be honest, it always seemed odd, especially when you consider digital games have leaked via pre-loads. In fact, that happened with <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/634490-grand-theft-auto-v/67072105"><em>GTA V</em> over a decade ago</a>. And now that Zelnick has weighed in officially to call the rumor false, hopefully that’s the end of it. Now, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-breakdown-secrets-spf-sunscreen-reddit-1851144759">GTA</a></em> fans can go back to figuring out the SPF rating of an NPC’s sunscreen via wild math and trailer screenshots.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> launches November 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">Take-Two has confirmed that marketing for the game will begin sometime in the summer</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4‘s Big Switch 2 Debut Is Officially On Pause]]></title>

            <guid>1424674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to be one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s big fall 2025 releases but was indefinitely delayed amid a race to address performance issues for the PC version. Many fans hoped it might end up launching in early 2026 instead, but the Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> is now officially being paused.</p> <p>“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety </em></a>on Thursday. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em> [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”</p>

 <p>What’s especially odd about the last-minute reversal is that<em> Borderlands 4</em> was already publicly demoed running on Switch 2 last summer at shows like PAX West. Assessments varied, with some players saying it looked surprisingly good while <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1958920625600569844%7Ctwgr%5Ef902f1abb49199769f6600e5bad50cb760a1d61f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fborderlands-4-performance-issues-nintendo-switch-2%2F">others said</a> it suffered from surprising performance hang-ups, even when docked.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay I’ll just put it bluntly:</p> <p>Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 could barely run at 30fps with 4 enemies on screen in docked mode. It had horrendous input delay, and the render resolution was seemingly turned all the way down.</p> <p>I’ll talk more about it in a video maybe tomorrow 😬</p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We need to share that the release of<em>&nbsp;Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">in a surprise announcement</a> last September less than two weeks before it was set to launch. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</p>

 <p>Gearbox Entertainment recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254">doubled down on big plans for the looter shooter’s 2026 content roadmap</a>. That includes a new rarity of gear, raising the level cap, and fresh story content in paid DLC packs. The roadmap even called out the addition of a new photo mode. The Switch 2 port, on the other hand, was conspicuously absent. Publisher 2K Games has yet to reveal how many copies the latest sequel has sold.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s absence from the Switch 2 will be a bummer for fans hoping they’d eventually be able to jump in, but it’s not the only port that players have been patiently waiting on. <em>Elden Ring</em> was also announced for Nintendo’s new console last year and also remains MIA. Demos last summer suggested it was having framerate issues as well. Other heavy hitters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> have performed well enough though.</p>
