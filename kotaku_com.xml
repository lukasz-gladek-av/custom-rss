They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible,” said Hamaguchi.</p><p>The director further explained, “We really are putting all our efforts into getting the third game out as quickly as we can. So for the moment, that’s where we’re focusing our time.”</p><p>Beyond the third chapter of the remake trilogy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamaguchi told the outlet</a></span> he might be open to doing more spin-offs of other games focused on different characters seen in the <em>FF7. </em></p><p>“I want it [<em>Remake </em>Chapter 3] to come out as quickly as possible and then move on maybe to look at some other stories, dig a bit deeper,” said Hamaguchi.</p><p>“There’s definitely a call out there to see other spotlights on other parts of the world and the universe, different characters, so I’d like to maybe switch to looking at them in a different way after we’ve got the third game out.”</p><p>For now, though, the focus is entirely on making the third and final game in the <em>FF7</em> remake trilogy as quickly as possible. So place your bets on when we’ll get our hands on the RPG. I’m thinking 2027. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He believes it so strongly, he’s willing to put his career on the line for it. “If he doesn’t get nominated this year, I’ll quit acting,” Brolin says. “It was a better movie than the first one. When I watched it, it felt like my brain was broken open. It’s masterful, and Denis is one of our master filmmakers.”</p><p>Not only is his career in jeopardy, but so, as Brolin sees it, is the integrity of the Academy Awards. “If the Academy Awards have any meaning whatsoever, they’ll recognize him,” Brolin said. While the stakes of Brolin’s current Oscar wager are higher, his delivery of it is much tamer than that in a video he posted a few years ago when Villeneuve failed to receive a directing nomination for the first <em>Dune</em>, even though the film  received ten. In that video, posted to his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuP5dsl8Xt/?igsh=MXRqbmRmaGNibTZyZw==&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZuP5dsl8Xt/?igsh=MXRqbmRmaGNibTZyZw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal Instagram page</a></span>, Brolin was very close to calling the entire award stupid.</p><p>“I don’t know how you get 10 nominations and then the guy who has done the impossible with that book doesn’t get nominated. It makes you realize that it’s all amazing and then it’s all fucking totally dumb.”</p><p>This year’s Oscar nominations are set to be revealed on January 17. According to Brolin’s IMDB, he has two films in production, <em>Weapon</em> and <em>The Running Man</em>, and will more than likely appear in the third <em>Dune </em>film. So, either the Academy gets it right, or else we riot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I loved making an older version of my <em>Inquisition </em>hero the first time I played through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830"><em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>, but the game doesn’t offer the option to import your Inquisitor into new playthroughs like it does with new hero Rook. As a result, you have to once again dive into each customization option for the Inquisitor and fiddle with the sliders until you get them looking just right, and while I enjoyed doing so the first time around, the prospect repeatedly killed my momentum when I thought about starting a second playthrough. However, fans have now found a workaround that allows you to easily import your Inquisitor from another save file and it’s pretty easy to do, if also a little convoluted.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

If you’re starting a new playthrough of <em>The Veilguard </em>and want to import your Inquisitor, the first step you’ll need to do in the character creator is skip over importing altogether. Tab over to the Finalize section of the character creator and open up the Past Adventures menu. This is the one that lets you customize your Inquisitor and a few of their past choices. Once here, open the Edit Inquisitor menu and go to the Appearance tab. From here, customize any option, literally anything. It can be a slight change in their head shape, their hair color, height, or whatever. The point here is to make the game recognize that there is an edited version of The Inquisitor in the character creator associated with this new save file, which adds a new option on the screen of presets, signified by a pair of bronze scissors. Your screen should look like this:</p><figure id="" data-id="672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-recommend-id="image://672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1330" data-height="745" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-recommend-id="image://672138d3b140ce12ede8de50d0e09c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1330" data-height="745" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now tab over to Finalize and go back to the screen to customize Rook. Tab over to the Lineage screen, and it’s here that you’ll import your Rook. Doing this will allow you to customize your hero again, but also, if you do the above steps before importing, you’ll be able to import your Inquisitor by clicking on the scissors icon on their customization screen. It’s a weird workaround to the lack of a proper, built-in option, and I wouldn’t be surprised if BioWare patched in a way to do this without all the convoluted menu navigation, as it’s clear the functionality is there. Luckily, once you’ve imported your Inquisitor, they’ll look the way you want through the entire game now that BioWare’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/author/kennethshepard?startIndex=20#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20The%20Veilguard%E2%80%99s%20First%20Patch%20Will%20Fix%20One%20Of%20The%20Game%E2%80%99s%20Biggest%20Problems&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/author/kennethshepard?startIndex=20#:~:text=Dragon%20Age%3A%20The%20Veilguard%E2%80%99s%20First%20Patch%20Will%20Fix%20One%20Of%20The%20Game%E2%80%99s%20Biggest%20Problems">squashed a bug</a></span> that made them revert to one of the default faces during the game’s finale.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
