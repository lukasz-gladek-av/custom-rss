And once again these orcs come in massive waves and funnel through maze-like maps that you can fill with deadly traps and barricades to create spots that kill all of them while you stand by and watch. In past games you completed levels in a set order and reached the end of the game that way.</p><p>However, this time around, the game is more like a roguelike and you end up replaying maps with randomly generated modifiers activated. You might have to deal with bigger enemies or you might be unable to revive co-op team members. Between waves of enemies you pick a randomly offered bonus or ability, like extra damage, which stays with you for the rest of that run. Runs are made up of two or more randomly generated missions and a harder boss fight featuring even more orcs and more places to put traps. Finishing runs earns you skulls that can be used to upgrade your traps or unlock new skills.</p><p>In theory, the random features should add to the replayablity of <em>Deathtrap</em>. But the problem is that, while in past games each new level led to a new map, here you end up playing on the same maps a lot. In fact, you’ll likely play on the same maps a few times during a co-op session. And that, coupled with the fact that you now have a limited number of barriers to place (which can change where orcs travel), means you’ll likely “solve” a map once and just more or less do that every time you play it again.</p><p>Sure, the modifiers can change that up a bit, but it does start to feel like a grind. And to actually to beat the game, you’ll need to do a lot of grinding to get all your traps boosted up and your skills maxed out. </p><p>Don’t get me wrong, <em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</em> is still a good time with a friend, and building a giant kill-box filled with a dozen traps all firing at once to massacre a horde of orcs in seconds is still very satisfying. But I do hope that a future <em>Orcs Must Die!</em> sequel returns to the level-based formula while sprinkling some of the roguelike elements from this one on top. Like a good, cheap burger that’s not missing the ketchup and is also improved with some bacon or better cheese. </p><p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap </em>is out January 28 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. It’s also available day one on Game Pass. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company was founded in 2020 by former <em>Dragon Age</em> creative director Mike Laidlaw and a group of ex-Ubisoft Quebec developers. And with its first game, the studio is leaning on its developers’ past.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/january-2025-game-release-calendar-ff7-rebirth-pc-1851730310/slides/10&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/january-2025-game-release-calendar-ff7-rebirth-pc-1851730310/slides/10"><em>Eternal Strands</em> is a large, map-based open-world fantasy action game</a></span> set in a new universe where people who practice magic—known as weavers—are shunned from society after a horrible event scarred the world. The epicenter of that disaster is a large kingdom of weavers who locked themselves away and disappeared after all that destruction. You play as Brynn, a young woman who has joined a band of weavers determined to explore that locked-away kingdom and discover what actually happened. To do that, you’ll need to explore various open-world maps, collect resources, craft better gear, fight a lot of enemies, and use your magic to survive.</p><p>If you’ve played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-kotaku-review-1845771449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-kotaku-review-1845771449"><em>Breath of the Wild </em>or <em>Immortals: Fenyx Rising</em></a></span>, you’ll be familiar with the type of game Yellow Brick Games has created. Its painterly visuals and character designs feel heavily inspired by the look of those other games. Similarly, the action RPG plays a lot like those games, too. You can block, dodge, parry, lock on to enemies, charge melee attacks to hit harder, and shoot arrows at far-away foes or items. And Brynn can climb practically any surface while you manage a depleting stamina bar that limits how far you can go before needing a rest (or falling). Yeah, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840">you’ve played games like before</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h1553"><a id=""></a>Magically blasting enemies off cliffs</h2><p>However, while <em>Eternal Strands </em>is clearly inspired by these past games, it also has its own ideas. A big one, literally, is that each map you visit (the world isn’t one big open world but a series of distinct locations) contains a massive boss enemy that can be defeated for rare resources. These enemies are truly huge. Usually, you can hear or see them stomping or flying around even when they’re way off in the distance. These bosses can be killed in standard combat or you can figure out a way to harvest them—like climbing on them to attack weakpoints—to extract the rare energy you need to upgrade your magic abilities. And this is something you’ll want to do because magic in <em>Eternal Strands</em> is awesome.</p><p>You start <em>Eternal Strands</em> with two powers: The ability to create ice walls to trap enemies or put out fires and a telekinesis power that can be used to grab items and enemies and hurl them around. As you progress you unlock more magic, including fire attacks and spells that let you drop gravity wells that suck enemies in and then blow up when triggered. Thankfully, all of these abilities feel really powerful right out of the gate and only get more powerful (and enjoyable) to use as you upgrade them.</p><figure id="" data-id="028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-recommend-id="image://028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Yellow Brick Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-recommend-id="image://028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I especially want to call out the telekinesis power as it’s mighty powerful right at the start of <em>Eternal Strands</em>. You can straight up grab most enemies and toss them off cliffs instead of fighting them, though you won’t be able to collect any resources if you do this. One of my favorite video game moments of 2025 so far is grabbing a big object and using my magic power to shunt it at a group of tiny enemies, sending them all flying off in different directions like pins being hit by a bowling ball.</p><p>Sadly, this physics-based action and the ability to set nearly anything on fire or break almost any item or prop you encounter does lead to some wonkiness in <em>Eternal Strands</em>. I’ve lost track of the number of times I flew off a cliff or boss seemingly for no reason. I also encountered issues with fire not always working to melt ice or burn structures. Or enemies getting stuck in debris or their pathing breaking in weird ways. Performance can also get rough if there are too many items breaking and too many enemies around at once.</p><p>There’s an overall sense that <em>Eternal Strands</em> is probably a tad too ambitious for the smaller team working on it. It’s like the game is <em>barely </em>being contained and at any point it could suddenly break, sending you flying into the air. It’s never so bad that the game is unplayable, but it might be too much for some players to put up with. At least the devs seem to know things can get wonky, and let you basically survive any fall from any height without taking much damage.</p><h2 id="h1554"><a id=""></a>Exciting exploration, but boring conversation</h2><p>Once you’re done tossing enemies around using magic, you’ll eventually return back to your base camp, and this is where <em>Eternal Strands </em>differs from most open-world RPGs. While the locations you visit are big and varied, including swampy forests, caves, and destroyed cities, they aren’t filled with random quests or objectives to complete. Instead, each map has a few collectibles, a previously mentioned boss (that respawns), and enemies to kill.</p><p>As you talk to the other members of your weaver band back at camp, you’re given quests that will have you visiting these maps for different reasons, like collecting flowers at night or finding a blueprint in a specific area. Once you’re done with that, you return, bringing back all the crafting resources you collected. Each of these treks out into the world moves time forward between day and night while also possibly activating different weather patterns and events. One time, I returned to an early area to complete an easy little collecting quest but discovered a nasty magic storm created by a new, harder boss monster. Enemies were more powerful, making the quest harder, but there was rarer loot to be had as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-recommend-id="image://4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Yellow Brick Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-recommend-id="image://4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Survive your trips out into the world and you return with all your loot. Die, and you come back to camp mostly empty-handed. This setup leads to a situation where as you spend more time in an area collecting good items while completing quests, you start to get nervous about dying and losing your resources. This tension makes combat against big bosses or enemy ambushes all the more exciting. This loop really got its hooks in me after a few hours, making me excited to go back out and get more crafting materials so I could upgrade my camp and improve my gear or even build brand-new weapons and armor.</p><p>It’s at this point that I’d love to tell you about how great the other members of your camp are and how talking to them is wonderful, but instead, a lot of the conversations with them are boring or worse, annoyed me. There are some standout moments with your camp leader and your archivist, but most of the time the chats with my camp felt like the vegetables I had to eat to get back to the sweet dessert of tossing trees at enemies and fighting big dragons.</p><p><em>Eternal Strands</em> is a very ambitious fantasy action RPG that’s inspired by some big-budget titles like <em>Dragon’s Dogma </em>and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The small team behind it mostly pulls it off thanks to a focus on dynamic, but not-too-big sandboxes to play around in, interesting boss fights, and a unique exploration loop that rewards adventurous players willing to take a chance. Sure, the physics don’t always work as expected and performance isn’t perfect, but <em>Eternal Strands </em>is fun enough to put up with these problems because when it comes together and works—which is more often than not—it’s an impressively fantastic game. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And before we go any further, let me just be clear: Unless you have a spare Steam Deck to break open, don’t do this to your portable device. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Crastinator-Pro</a></span>, the impetus for creating the Steam Brick might not be what you expect. As explained on GitHub, the Steam Brick was created because the Steam Deck is too big to fit in Crastinator-Pro’s backpack. And since the Steam Deck was usually plugged into a TV or AR glasses when the modder was using it, they wondered how much smaller the device could be if it didn’t have a screen or built-in controls. To find out, they ripped one open and started gutting all the unneeded bits.</p><figure id="" data-id="007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-recommend-id="image://007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-recommend-id="image://007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After some tinkering, the modder realized that they could remove all the inner boards and components related to the touch pads, analog sticks, buttons, and other controls and the Steam Deck would still work. They also removed the screen and any components and bits connected to it and it still worked. Next they printed out a small, basic plastic case and shoved what was left of the Steam Deck’s carcass into the box, sealed it up and added a USB port and power button and...there you go! A Steam Deck console.</p><p>Now, Crastinator-Pro makes it very clear that you probably shouldn’t do this yourself, calling it a “very bad idea” and further explaining that they were “honestly surprised” this worked. They say not to think of the GitHub post as a guide but instead as more of a “How I Did It” post. And while the end result works for the modder—they now have a tiny device they can toss in their backpack—they aren’t sure how long the Steam Brick will keep working after all the modifications. </p><p>If you’re really wanting a Steam console, don’t do this.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-valves-fremont-console-and-rumored-steam-devices-2000536791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-valves-fremont-console-and-rumored-steam-devices-2000536791"> Instead, just wait for Valve to make one</a></span>. Rumors are swirling that Valve is currently working on a TV-based device that will run SteamOS and will operate like a Steam Deck for your TV. That sounds safer than using power tools on a Steam Deck to make it smaller. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here, the open-world RPG ostensibly improves its arguably disappointing technical performance and presentation issues on console by way of more powerful CPU and GPU combos available in the PC gaming world. It also launched as a Steam Deck-verified game, bolstering an alluring green checkmark on the Steam store page and even saw a promotional video from developer Square Enix touting Steam Deck playability with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2kQnT3tADKw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2kQnT3tADKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cute, feathery chocobo-themed Steam Deck</a></span>. But as many have found since release, while the game certainly “runs” on the Deck, it’s far from an ideal experience. This prompts two questions: Should you bother playing <em>Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck? And, perhaps most importantly, is this what we should expect from a “Verified” Steam Deck game?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195905,195189" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve spent about half a dozen hours with <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck, using the default settings (with one notable tweak to the framerate). I’ve played up to the Junon section, the game’s second open-world environment, as I felt this would take me through enough combat, exploration, dungeon crawling, and cutscenes to establish an opinion on how well (or poorly) this game runs on Valve’s handheld. </p><p>In motion, I’m averaging a decent-enough 30 frames per second, often a bit more as I lifted the 30 FPS cap in the default graphics settings (which sets all visuals to “Low” on first boot and doesn’t feature any AI upscaling tech). Performance will dip into the teens at worst from time to time (moreso when I tried nudging some graphics settings up to “Medium”). Overall, the experience reminds me of what it was like to play your average AAA game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 during the tail end of their lives: Playable, but it certainly left you wishing your gaming box had a bit more digital horsepower. (Though admittedly, even at their worst, PS3 games typically had cleaner image quality in comparison.) I seem to be getting about two-and-a-half hours of battery life, too.</p><p>At an average of 30-40 FPS, the performance might just be good enough for you. But unfortunately, the image quality really struggles. More often than not, the game looks like…well, it’s just ugly. Here, have a look: </p><figure id="" data-id="7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-recommend-id="image://7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-recommend-id="image://7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not always this bad, mind you. Sometimes the game looks quite good for the form factor it’s running on. Have a look at a better shot:</p><figure id="" data-id="1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-recommend-id="image://1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-recommend-id="image://1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But then you’ll move the camera and things will look fuzzy, jaggy, smeary, blurry, blocky, or whatever descriptive term you prefer. Draw distances look funky and dull, diminishing the bold natural beauty of the game’s world, which is unfortunate not just because it denies you the incredible visual spectacle the game is aiming for but also because that beauty has thematic meaning in-game: it is, after all, the beauty of the very in-game world the protagonists are fighting to save. On top of all this, I find the UI to be a bit too busy and small. And in <em>Rebirth</em>, you’ll spend quite a bit of time menu-diving as you spec out your characters.</p><p>Still, <em>Rebirth</em>’s somewhat reliable framerate performance on the Deck has kept me playing the game, and I’ll likely keep playing this way for a while as, right now, I’m just looking to dust off my rusty combat skills for a run at Hard Mode in the future (when I’ll almost certainly play the game on a more powerful machine). </p><figure id="" data-id="a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-recommend-id="image://a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-recommend-id="image://a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I find the game’s fusion of real-time fighting and command-based action in combat comes through well enough on the Steam Deck for me to keep going. In fact, given how much combat is in the game, and how much time you may wish to spend grinding the open world and Chadley’s training simulations, the Steam Deck version isn’t a bad portable companion to a proper PC experience, if you switch to that better hardware for the game’s more impactful narrative sequences. I could easily see myself grinding out some new weapon skills while playing on the train, only to switch over to my more powerful gaming machine to move the story along and enjoy those far better visuals once I get home.</p><p>If you travel a lot and have a high tolerance for visuals that range from “meh” to “oh, god,” the reliable performance of <em>Rebirth</em> on Deck might be a compromise you’re willing to make—especially if you’re an <em>FF7</em> super fan who will be won over by the story, music, and characters. </p><p>I do worry, however, about how well said performance will hold up across the rest of the game. Later combat sequences, such as one featuring multiple opponents in a large arena, or the more climactic, physically larger boss battles that feature way more flashy visual effects, could result in dips that might test your patience.</p><p>And despite being technically playable, <em>FF7 Rebirth</em>’s messy visuals yet again call into question what Valve is communicating by slapping the “Verified” green checkmark on a game. </p><h2 id="h18774"><a id=""></a>What should our expectations be for Steam Deck performance?</h2><p><em>Rebirth</em> isn’t the first game to usher in a conversation about whether or not Steam’s “Verified” status is as trustworthy as it should be. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/nLLiYXpFAHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/nLLiYXpFAHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023’s <em>Remnant II: From Ashes</em></a></span> brought up similar issues as it received a Verified status only to be a miserable experience for almost everyone who tried it on Valve’s portable gaming PC.</p><p>Valve has three tiers to indicate how playable a game is on Steam Deck. A white “no” sign with “Unsupported” means that the game most likely will not run on the Deck (though many Steam Deck users have found ways around this). This can be because the game is simply too graphically intensive, or something about it simply doesn’t play well with the Deck’s behind-the-scenes Linux magic that tricks Windows games into thinking they’re on Microsoft’s operating system. A yellow exclamation sign with “Playable” means that the game will almost certainly run, but either features text and icons that are just too small for the device’s screen or it’s a kind of game that really needs a full keyboard and mouse to enjoy. And then there’s the green checkmarked “Verified” status, which in theory should be an open invitation to enjoy the game on Steam Deck with no issues.</p><figure id="" data-id="e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-recommend-id="image://e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-recommend-id="image://e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, most gamers with at least some knowledge of CPU and GPU limitations probably do (and should) expect compromise on something as portable on Steam Deck. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for example, will run on Deck, but no reasonable person should expect it to do so with high graphics settings across the board and ray-tracing turned on. And while <em>2077</em> might run into some framerate troubles here and there on Deck, its visuals are way cleaner than what <em>Rebirth</em> offers on Valve’s mini-PC. During my time with <em>Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck, I also compared it to the visuals found on Kojima Productions’ <em>Death Stranding</em>, which immediately offered a stark contrast to <em>Rebirth</em>’s fuzziness with much clearer depictions of its landscapes and highly detailed character models.</p><figure id="" data-id="31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-recommend-id="image://31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-recommend-id="image://31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If we are to accept <em>Rebirth</em> as being worthy of the Verified status on Steam Deck, it seems clear that this is the very minimum of what we should consider acceptable, and such games should leave us asking just what kind of “Verified” a given game might be when we choose to purchase it. Why couldn’t <em>Rebirth</em> have been awarded “Playable” status instead? To many, including myself, that would be a more accurate description and is certainly how I’d describe <em>Rebirth</em>’s portable experience. Then again, without that Verified status, Square Enix wouldn’t be able to advertise the game as such and Valve would have one less AAA title to proudly display as Verified on their popular device. It’s hard not to worry that “Verified” status can play too much of a marketing role for all parties involved when ideally, it should perhaps be a more scientific, objective assessment of what any given game is like on the Deck.</p><figure id="" data-id="6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-recommend-id="image://6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-recommend-id="image://6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/playstation-5-pro-shows-futility-of-video-game-graphics-race&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/playstation-5-pro-shows-futility-of-video-game-graphics-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video game graphics</a></span> in general have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/arts/video-games-graphics-budgets.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/arts/video-games-graphics-budgets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an increasingly complicated subject</a></span> of late.
