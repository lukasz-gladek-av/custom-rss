It’s been announced that a whopping 20 games are being removed from the service, including big names like <em>Hades</em>, and even Netflix exclusives like <em>Monument Valley 3</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,195670,196470" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s fair to say <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394">we didn’t view Netflix’s move into gaming</a></span> with long-term optimism. The video streaming service’s intention to stream games, too, was announced in the rubble of Google’s abysmal attempt, Stadia, while the majority of its offerings—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-iphone-ipad-android-into-breach-poinpy-1849390826?_gl=1*1cj9vml*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3NzM3NDYkbzE0NyRnMSR0MTc1MDc5ODI2OCRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-iphone-ipad-android-into-breach-poinpy-1849390826?_gl=1*1cj9vml*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3NzM3NDYkbzE0NyRnMSR0MTc1MDc5ODI2OCRqNTckbDAkaDA.">though often excellent</a></span>—were for a long time confined to mobile devices. Clearly the company had big intentions, at one point setting up a AAA studio, Team Blue, with names like Chacko Sonny, formerly of Blizzard; Joseph Staten, known for his work on <em>Halo;</em> and <em>God of War</em> art director Rafael Grassetti. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">that didn’t survive for long</a></span>, with the studio closing late last year having not released anything, not even a potential game’s name.</p><p>It was only this time last year that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876">Netflix declared it was developing an enormous 80 new games</a></span> to be added to the 96 already hosted by the service. And it’s important to note that there are some all-time classics among what’s already there. <em>GTA San Andreas</em>, <em>Oxenfree</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>... These are games people want to play.</p><p>However, it’s now known that their numbers are in fact going to drop by 20, with names like <em>Hades</em>, <em>Braid</em>, <em>Monument Valley</em> and <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> to be lost throughout July. Even more notably, some of the games listed as leaving were until now exclusive to the service, such as <em>Rainbow Six: SMOL</em> and <em>Monument Valley 3</em>. It’s unclear at this point what will happen to these games, and whether they will be made available to play anywhere else.</p><p>This move follows not only the closure of Team Blue last November, but also the  move that same month to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-interactive-movies-shows-black-mirror-removed-1851690321&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-interactive-movies-shows-black-mirror-removed-1851690321">delist 20 of Netflix’s interactive television programs</a></span>. Four remained, however, including popular experiments like <em>Black Mirror</em>’s episode “Bandersnatch,” and <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend</em>, but even these are now gone as of May 2025. (For some reason Bear Grylls’ <em>You vs. Wild</em> remains available.)</p><p>While there’s been no official announcement, it does seem somewhat unlikely that Netflix’s previously announced plans to release a new internally developed game every month will be met. These, however, are mostly intended to be tie-ins with new shows and movies, so perhaps the company will push ahead with them as promotional material.</p><p>It does seem safe to say that Netflix’s ambitions to break into original gaming, however, look to be pretty much over. Here’s the full list of games departing the service next month, most of which are gone by July 14:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Battleship</em></li><li><em>Braid, Anniversary Edition</em></li><li><em>Carmen Sandiego</em></li><li><em>CoComelon: Play with JJ</em></li><li><em>Death’s Door</em></li><li><em>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</em></li><li><em>Dumb Ways to Die</em></li><li><em>FashionVerse</em></li><li><em>Ghost Detective</em></li><li><em>Hades</em></li><li><em>Katana ZERO</em></li><li><em>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</em></li><li><em>Ludo King</em></li><li><em>Monument Valley</em></li><li><em>Monument Valley 2</em></li><li><em>Monument Valley 3</em></li><li><em>Rainbow Six: SMOL</em></li><li><em>Raji: An Ancient Epic</em></li><li><em>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</em></li><li><em>TED Tumblewords</em></li><li><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></li><li><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol </em></li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Vineyard Valley</em></li></ul><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038]]></content:encoded>

Maybe.</p><p>What is certain is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-heel-turn-bad-guy-cody-rhodes-wrestlemania-41-1851767373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-heel-turn-bad-guy-cody-rhodes-wrestlemania-41-1851767373">John Cena</a></span>’s heel run is making fans feel all kinds of ways, which couldn’t be more appropriate for the most polarizing figure in the history of professional wrestling.</p><p>A little over halfway through the 17-time champ’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-retirement-tour-wwe-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851732028">retirement tour</a></span>, we’re pausing to take stock of what we like and what we don’t like about Bad Guy Cena so far. If you want some, come get some.</p></div></div><div><p>You can betray the fans who looked up to you. You can punt the hell out of Cody Rhodes’ coin purse. You can even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOg7P3QM3nI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOg7P3QM3nI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cuckold Zach Ryder</a></span>. But you will NOT turn your back on cameraman Stu and get away with it.</p><p>The devil is in the details for Cena’s heel entrance; its evolution (including ignoring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.facebook.com/reel/649578350863396/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/649578350863396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stu, whom he used to salute</a></span>) has ever so slightly changed his former entrance, but made it all the more impactful.</p><p>Instead of a typical highlight reel, the Attitude Adjuster’s titantron is black with his name bolded in big white letters. The arena lights turn off, and the spotlight is completely on the GOAT as the crowd is hidden by the darkness. It signals that Cena matters and the fans don’t.</p><p>On the Raw after WrestleMania 41, the newly crowned, record-breaking champion forced ring announcer Mark Nash to read from a script to introduce him. It mentions Cena as the “never seen 17” champ—a slick nod to the titles he’s won and “You can’t see me” moniker.</p><p>Of course, the pop that the new heel receives while all of this happens is generational. The boos are so deafening that they drown out his theme song, and “John Cena sucks” chants become the de facto lyrics.</p><p>A good entrance props up the baddest of men, and in that category, heel Cena shines.</p></div><div><p>On March 5, 2024, the script for a John Cena heel turn was leaked…by John Cena.</p><p>In an interview with wrestling reporter Chris Van Vliet, the then 16-time champ revealed that he was “real close” to joining the dark side when he feuded with The Rock in 2012. (Skip to around 30:18 in the above video.)</p><p>Had he turned, he would have flipped “Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect” on its head: show up less, malign the fans who love him, and disrespect his opponents. Sound familiar?</p><p>He also apparently created a new theme song and designed low-cut wrestling singlets with accompanying boxing robes in preparation.</p><p>Almost one year later to the date, Cena pulled off the stunning turn, but his music and ring gear haven’t changed. Why?</p><p>A heel’s job isn’t to provide fan service. They’re supposed to get under our skin and not let us have fun things. In the words of another all-time great, it doesn’t matter what we want.</p><p>John Boy’s time (for himself) is now, and he’s going to profit off of his colorful, campy t-shirts and hats whether we like it or not. At least we’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XD-vzaRENY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XD-vzaRENY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span> to live out our heel Cena theme song fantasies. </p></div><div><p>  <strong>​</strong></p><p>Going into Cena’s retirement tour, if you were told it would feature multiple matches with R-Truth, you might ask, “What’s up?” Or more likely, “What the fuck?”</p><p>The WWE has blessed us with a series of dream bouts for the GOAT before he rides off into the sunset, which includes the WrestleMania main event with Rhodes (his modern-day equivalent) and rivalry renewals with his greatest in-ring foes, Randy Orton and CM Punk. </p><p>There’s also his unexpected, low-key banger of a feud with R-Truth—a classic tale of a superhero disappointing his biggest fan, only for the fan to seek revenge. It was a real Syndrome-Mr. Incredible moment.</p><p>The good news is Cena has half a year’s worth of opponents left. Is a rematch with Roman Reigns on the table? Could we see him set his sights on the new era guys, like Bron Breaker, Gunther, or LA Knight? It would likely require an eventual face turn for those first two to make sense, which we are certainly here for.</p></div><div><p>Three words have followed John Cena throughout his career: “You can’t wrestle.”</p><p>The WWE Universe hurled the chant at Big Match John, particularly from 2005 - 2012, when he ruled the WWE landscape. He wasn’t the smoothest or most athletic in the ring, and his moveset was limited to the infamous five moves of doom. Not to mention, he won matches in improbable, yet nauseatingly repetitive comeback fashion.</p><p>In 2015, Cena silenced the critics.</p><p>He instituted the United States Championship Open Challenge, welcoming anyone to fight him for his title, week in and week out. He ripped off a series of excellent, closely contested bouts in which he introduced impressive new maneuvers while elevating the likes of Kevin Owens, Cesaro, Sami Zayn, and more.</p><p>A decade later, Cena is limited once again in the ring. It’s hard to blame him since he’s 48 years old and a Hollywood actor that relies on his face and frame. Still, it’s painfully obvious that opponents are handling him as if he’s made of glass, and the matches themselves feel like they’re moving at 0.5 speed.</p></div><div><p>Like Ric Flair, Steve Austin, and The Rock before him, mic work elevated John Cena to super-duper star status.</p><p>As the Doctor of Thuganomics, Cena rapped his enemies into submission and won over the WWE Universe. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlSWOSINGk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlSWOSINGk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">belittled and exposed The Final Boss</a></span> for writing promos on his wrist. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cLMYMrOTk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cLMYMrOTk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called out Roman Reigns</a></span> for forgetting his lines and not inspiring the WWE’s confidence to anoint him face of the company.</p><p>No matter who verbally swung at his head—including fans—including fans, John had an ingenious response,. aAll while taking the high road and serving as a role model for kids.</p><p>Now, Cena is masterfully unleashing 20+ years of pent up heel energy. He seamlessly mixes fiction and reality, expressing frustrations (that maybe he always had?) with the WWE Universe for treating him like shit when he gave them his life.</p><p>He breaks the fourth wall by insisting that he’s not a face or a heel, but a human being. He weaponizes the criticisms fans launched at him, declaring that he’d bury Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania like he’s done to countless other opponents.</p><p>You could argue his promos are redundant and at times overacted, which might be true. However, his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExQYm6gintE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExQYm6gintE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-Elimination Chamber masterclass</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47otpATArSM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47otpATArSM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverse Pipe Bomb</a></span> were instantly classic—two of his best promos to date. You can’t ask for much more than that. </p></div><div><p>John Cena finally decided to sever his (as he described it) “abusive,” “dysfunctional,” and “toxic” relationship with the WWE Universe. Therapists everywhere smiled.</p><p>Still, it begs the question: After 20-plus years of loving fans unconditionally, why would the former Leader of the Cenation have such a sudden change of heart—without any build or breaking point moment? That needed to be addressed more effectively.</p><p>Picture this: Instead of kicking Cody Rhodes in the nads at the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wrestlemania-41-john-cena-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851769430&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wrestlemania-41-john-cena-cody-rhodes-the-rock-1851769430">Elimination Chamber</a></span>, the GOAT remained a babyface and lost cleanly to the American Nightmare at WrestleMania 41. Then he would narrowly lose to Cody again at Backlash. And then he would be inches away from grabbing the Money in the Bank briefcase but fall short.</p><p>Cena’s days would be numbered; his opportunity to capture a record-breaking 17th championship shrinking with each appearance.</p><p>At SummerSlam, Cody would grant Cena one last title shot. As the match unfolded, Cena just couldn’t put Rhodes away—Attitude Adjustment after Attitude Adjustment, from the top rope, and maybe a piledriver for good measure. Kick-out.</p><p>Conflicted, Cena ultimately would decide to smash Rhodes in the head with the belt when the ref isn’t looking to pick up the 1-2-3.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, John would explain his actions and attempt to celebrate with the fans, but they would reject him. That would cause Cena to snap and lead to him violently attacking Rhodes (putting him on the shelf), then admonishing the WWE Universe for spitting in the face of his crowning achievement and treating him like shit all these years.</p><p>This would set up three to four months of supervillain Cena—much like the guy we’re seeing now—whose reign was built on rock-solid motivation, courtesy of Kotaku.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/john-cena-heel-cody-rhodes-r-truth-night-of-champions-1851785024]]></content:encoded>
