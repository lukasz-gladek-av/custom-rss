              <p>There’s a large storm forming on the horizon. This October, around 40 games across all kinds of genres, franchises, and scales are set to launch on every major platform under the sun. There’s no escaping it. There are likely at least two games (or more!) in October that you’ll want to play, including stuff like <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-closed-weapon-system-better-beta-ea-bf6-2000618282"><em>Battlefield</em> 6</a> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>. So batten down the hatches and get ready to ride out the video game super storm that is coming in just a few short months.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of planned October releases as of August 20:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> – October 2</li> <li><em>Gigasword</em> – October 2</li> <li><em>Neon Inferno</em> – October 2</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 – October 3</li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> – October 3</li> <li><em>Absolum</em> – October 9</li> <li><em>Painkiller</em> – October 9</li> <li><em>Barbie Horse Trails</em> – October 10</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – October 10</li> <li><em>Little Nightmares 3</em> – October 10</li> <li><em>Nascar 25</em> – October 14</li> <li><em>Just Dance 2026</em> – October 14</li> <li><em>Ball x Pit</em> – October 15</li> <li><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> – October 16</li> <li><em>Keeper</em> – October 17</li> <li><em>The Elf on the Shelf: Christmas Heroes</em> – October 17</li> <li><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> – October 21</li> <li><em>Bloodlines 2</em> – Oct 21</li> <li><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> – October 21</li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> – October 21</li> <li><em>Double Dragon Revive</em> – October 23</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> – Oct 23</li> <li><em>Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted</em> – October 23</li> <li><em>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</em> – October 23</li> <li><em>Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</em> – October 24</li> <li><em>Once Upon a Katamari</em> – October 24</li> <li><em>Ire: A Prologue</em> – October 28</li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2 – </em>October 29</li> <li><em>Arc Raiders – </em>October 30</li> <li><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> – October 31</li> <li><em>Mina the Hollower</em> – October 31</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">On Tuesday, during Gamescom Opening Night Live,</a> I noticed a few games received October launch dates. I wondered to myself how many other games were arriving in that same month. Checking online, I discovered a giant list of October releases. This is one of the most jam-packed months I’ve seen in some time. It’s not just that a lot of games are arriving in a short window, but how varied the list is. We have big open-world AAA games, like <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and, on Switch 2, <em>Borderlands 4.</em>&nbsp;But we also have smaller games like <em>Ball X Pit</em> and <em>Moonlighter 2</em>. There’s a park builder courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-leak-october-ps5-baby-dinos-1851783878"><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a> and a massive online shooter in the form of <em>Battlefield 6.</em> New <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Digimon</em> games, a fresh <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, a big Obsidian RPG, a creepy horror game, vampires, and even a fucking Christmas game. Heck, the new Double Fine game, <em>Keeper</em>, is out in October, and I’ve been waiting years for that studio’s next project. Now it’s coming, but sandwiched between, like, six other games I want to play.</p> <p>What’s going on here? Well, some of this is just normal video game industry stuff. Studios want to get their games out before the holiday shopping season. But I bet some of these games were holding off until they knew what Rockstar was planning with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> And once it became clear October and November wouldn’t be dominated by <em>GTA 6, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799#:~:text=Copied!&amp;text=Rockstar%20has%20announced%20that%20GTA,time%20to%20create%20the%20game.">as Rockstar delayed the open-world game to May 2026</a><em>,</em> some publishers and devs likely committed to launching in the spookiest month of the year.</p> <p>Sure, maybe a few of these get delayed, but I’m not holding my breath. October isn’t that far away, so I’d expect most of these games to be locked in and not budge to November or later. That’s a scary thought as someone who works at a video game website. While I’m excited to have new stuff to play and write about, I wish it were a bit more spread out. Such is life. Good luck out there, folks, and remember: You can’t play it all, so play what you can and enjoy the ride.</p>

              <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might not be the only massive sci-fi RPG on Switch 2 for long. Could <em>Starfield</em> get ported as well? Why is <em>Dead Space</em>‘s old Creative Director all-in on AI? And How did an AI replica of a real content creator make its way onto the official <em>First Descendent</em> TikTok channel? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s brief daily roundup of gaming culture and news, where we’re doing a bunch of clean-up from the first day of Gamescom 2025.</p>  <p>Podcaster NateTheHate, who’s quickly developed a reputation for accurate leaks around upcoming Nintendo announcements, now claims Bethesda’s open-world sci-fi RPG is coming to the company’s handheld hybrid next year. “<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027">posted on X</a> yesterday. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5…<em>Starfield</em> is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.” FromSoftware’s <em>The Duskbloods</em> has also been confirmed for Switch 2 in 2026, and Nintendo has yet to reveal any of its expected slate for the console’s second year. <em>Starfield</em> is reportedly coming to PS5 next year as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">seemingly closer to whenever the second expansion launches</a>.</p> <h2><em>The First Descendent</em> blames TikTok for AI slop video</h2> <p>Nexon’s free-to-play loot shooter, also known as “Gooner <em>Destiny</em>,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-ads-tiktok-the-first-descendant-nexon-2000618182">accidentally shared an AI-generated ad on TikTok</a> that ripped off another content creator. <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/3100882">The publisher now says</a> a TikTok marketing program automatically solicited the ad and linked it to <em>The First Descendants’</em> account with no controls to verify copyright infringement or other content concerns. Sounds bad! “<span lang="EN-US">We will also be committed to continuously being more transparent and responsible to regain the trust of our community and creators,” the company writes. “</span><span lang="EN-US">Once again, we deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this incident has caused.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> could be coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">told <em>VGC</em></a> at Gamescom that Square Enix is in talks with Nintendo about porting the hit MMORPG over. “The discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future,” he said. It sounds like <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> isn’t out of the question either. Yoshida added, “For me, it’s just my aim to provide <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and <em>16</em> to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games.”</p> <h2>The director of <em>Callisto Protocol</em> is going all-in on AI</h2> <p>Glen Schofield <a href="http://AI is going to be fantastic">told<em> The Game Industry</em></a> “AI is going to be fantastic.” He said he’s holding seminars about how AI can make creatives more efficient and thinks the technology will be an inevitable part of game development in 5-10 years, but he’s not sure exactly how it will all shake out. “Is it going to be an engine?” he said. “Right now, it’s a whole bunch of things that just kind of suck it in… and into what? It’s going to have to settle down a bit before we actually use it.” Schofield also claimed<em> Callisto Protocol</em> sold over 5 million copies, but regretted not delaying it. He said AAA games are not dead and is looking for someone to pay him to make another.</p> <h2><em>High on Life 2</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>The sci-fi comedy shooter <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/">will arrive</a> on PC and console, including on Game Pass, on February 13, 2026. Ralph Ineson, best known as Cid in <em>FF16</em> and more recently Galactus in <em>The</em> <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, will be voicing the newest gun in the game.</p>

 <h2><em>Triangle Strategy</em> shadow-drops on Xbox and PS5</h2> <p>The HD-2D homage to games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was previously a Switch exclusive on console. Square Enix’s port is <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958158169240371511">now on Xbox</a> with a starting discount of 30 percent off.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> comes to PS5 in November</h2> <p>The survival horror shooter <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1958150213127798847">makes the jump</a> on November 20 as more former Xbox console exclusives get ported and help round-out Sony’s previously anemic 2025 release slate.</p> <h2>The biggest lines at Gamescom are for <em>Silksong</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS IS THE LINE OF HOLLOW KNIGHT SILKSONG ON PRESS DAY AT 9AM. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gamescom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gamescom</a> <a href="https://t.co/lNz1q62AZ5">pic.twitter.com/lNz1q62AZ5</a></p> <p>— Daan K. 🔜 Gamescom 2025 (@NintenDaan) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenDaan/status/1958063065150226808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel is getting a special announcement on August 21—<a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">a release date, hopefully?</a>—but in the meantime, attendees at Gamescom are making the <em>Silksong</em> demos at the Nintendo and Xbox booths the highlights of the show so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-offers-buttery-smooth-performance-on-switch-2">Nintendo Life&nbsp;already went hands-on</a> and confirmed the Metroidvania Soulslike supports 120Hz refresh on Switch 2 in TV mode.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">Kirby Air Riders has a release date and looks refreshingly old-school</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">Rod Fergusson is trying to save BioShock a second time</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/denshattack-train-game-tony-hawk-anime-onl-gamescom-2025-trailer-2000618578">This Japanese train game was the best thing revealed at Gamescom</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hidden SECRETS In GTA 3" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBpNWVDQ5QM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
