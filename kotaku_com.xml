              <p>I love this time of year. Cozy weather. Tasty cookies and warm cocoa. <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-still-hasnt-taken-down-its-christmas-decorations-1841522397">Festive events in games</a>. And of course, all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">Christmas</a> lights hanging on houses, businesses, and elsewhere. In particular, I have a soft spot for all the colorful lights that get hung up during December. They just look so magical at night and fill me with nostalgic feelings. What can I say? I’m a sucker for plastic lights.</p> <p>So when I randomly discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/"><em>Light Up the Town</em></a>, a newly released cozy indie game all about decorating a wintry small town with Christmas lights, I immediately installed it and happily discovered a wonderful holiday treat that I can’t stop playing.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/">Out now on Steam, <em>Light Up the Town</em></a> has a super simple premise. You play as a young anthropomorphized ferret named Bean who is going through some stuff. His father, in an effort to lift his spirits, asks Bean to follow in his own footsteps and handle lighting up the entire small Colorado town of Bellflower. If he does this, he’ll get a new bike for Christmas. There’s more going on, but I’ll leave that for you to discover on your own. The narrative isn’t bad at all, but it’s not why you should play <em>Light Up the Town</em>. The real reason is that decorating this snow-covered town with various Christmas lights and decorations is sublime.</p>

 <p>In real life, putting up lights across multiple buildings, roofs, and interiors can be a hassle of tangled cables, extension cords, and broken bulbs. <em>Light Up the Town</em> doesn’t include any of that. Instead, you are able to fling strings of lights in different colors and shapes across large distances like a Christmas Jedi. You can also undo your actions and cut light strings whenever you want, letting you create massively long or incredibly short strings of light. Also, don’t worry about plugs or running cords. Lights just work, regardless of where you put them. Is this realistic? Nope! And I love it. It’s all the joy of hanging lights up and making a home glow without the hassle or headaches the process can create in the real world.</p>

I recommend playing in first-person mode, but regardless of what view you pick, the end result of putting up all these lights is always magical. The lighting in this game is phenomenal and changes based on how you decorate. Cover a house in just a few white lights? The glow will be softer and dimmer. Fill a room with 20 strings of red and green lights? You’ll create a vibrant Christmas rave. As you hang up lights, look for coins to collect. These can be spent at stores to unlock more varieties of lights and new decoration items.</p> <p>Each time I stepped back after putting up lights for an hour or so, I’d find myself lingering the same way I do in real life when spotting Christmas lights at night. <em>Light Up the Town</em> truly nails the festive and cozy vibes of a cold, dark night in December filled with thousands of tiny bright lights in the snow. For fans of the holiday season, put on your favorite festive songs, make a hot beverage, grab a blanket, and then dive into <em>Light Up the Town.</em>&nbsp;Just set a timer so you don’t spend your whole night decorating.</p>

              <p><em>All You Need Is Kill</em> is a Japanese “light novel” by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, published in 2004, that became the basis for the surprisingly excellent Tom Cruise sci-fi flick <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>. It’s now receiving a much more faithful anime adaptation from director Kenichiro Akimoto, coming out next month, and the first trailer is <em>breathtaking</em>.</p> <p>I need to confess: To my own detriment, I am not an anime guy. It’s a massive gap in my cultural awareness and personal entertainment, and I deserve all your ire. However, from the opening frames of the <em>All You Need Is Kill</em> trailer, I was hooked. This film looks stunning.</p>

  <p>The time loop novel told the story of Keiji Kiriya, who had recently joined the United Defense Force to help battle an alien race called the Mimics. The war is not going well, and like so many, Keiji appears to be killed on his very first mission. Except, for some reason, he wakes up to find himself back at the start of the same day, <em>Groundhog Day</em> style. This time loop allows Keiji to become an ever-more-skillful soldier, as well as recognize that fellow soldier Rita Vrataski is also trapped in the same loop.</p>

 <p>This movie, however, flips the script, focusing on Rita’s perspective of the events, where we see her early experiences of the time loop as she’s repeatedly killed by a giant alien flower, and her eventual discovery of Keiji’s involvement. It’s due to release in Japan on January 9, and then come to the U.S. by January 16, distributed by GKIDS, the company that released&nbsp;<em>The Boy and the Heron</em> in 2024.</p>

 <p>I’m so taken by the mix of media in the trailer, especially the incredibly brief and extraordinary use of the first-person perspective when Rita wakes for the first time. It looks compelling, and early word is that a screening at the French Annecy International Animation Film Festival went down very well.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I think it might be time for yet another rewatch of&nbsp;<em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>.</p>
