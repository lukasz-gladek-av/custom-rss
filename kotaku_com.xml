              <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-war-of-the-worlds-features-a-head-scratching-twist-2000636929">Amazon’s new <em>War of the Worlds</em> movie</a> starring Ice Cube and Eva Longoria was quietly released online last week and received universally negative reviews. Clips of the horrible sci-fi disaster flick, which is told entirely via a computer screen, have gone viral online. But one particular clip involving an Amazon delivery driver and a drone perfectly sums up how this latest iteration of the classic sci-fi story is less a movie and more a cheap branding exercise that doesn’t even hit 90 minutes.</p> <p>Released on July 30, <em>War of the Worlds</em> was <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/ice-cube-to-star-in-untitled-patrick-aiello-timur-bekmambetov-sci-fi-pic-for-universal-1234584529/">cooked up during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and tells the story of an alien invasion. But instead of following a group of characters through a dangerous and hostile invasion, you mostly watch Ice Cube struggle to act in front of a webcam for 80 minutes, not counting the credits and opening logos. Very late in the film, Ice Cube’s character needs a specific piece of code to shut down a powerful computer that the aliens are going after, and which the United States is willing to nuke to keep out of their Martian hands. The problem is that Ice Cube and a load of people, including his family, would be killed by the bomb. So a hacker sends him the code. But he has to put it on a USB thumb drive, which he somehow doesn’t have. Don’t worry, Ice Cube’s daughter has an idea. She downloads the code and loads it up on a USB drive, and then her boyfriend, who is an Amazon delivery driver, will use his Amazon Prime Air drone to deliver the USB device to Ice Cube and save the day. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hypercubexl.bsky.social/post/3lvgttjlv5s2h">Here’s the scene:</a></p>  <p>Yeah, you just watched an Amazon Prime ad shoved into this movie about an alien invasion. This honestly feels like a Super Bowl commercial more than a film. And here’s the wild thing: This isn’t the worst moment involving Amazon in the movie. A few minutes after this scene, the drone crashes and flips over near a homeless man living in a tent. This man is scared, as all around him are alien tripods destroying Earth. But our “heroes” need his help. So they use NSA tech to track down his phone number and text him to flip the drone over. He won’t risk his life to do it so they offer him a $1,000 Amazon gift card, pushing him over the edge and getting him to fulfill the deadly task. Gross shit!</p> <p>Anyway, <em>War of the Worlds</em> is barely a movie. More than half the runtime is just a view of a desktop PC and stock footage spliced into windows as if they’re security cameras or YouTube videos. It’s horrendous. It’s awful. And it’s exactly the kind of movie Amazon and other big corporations want to make. Movies that are barely movies, made for little money, starring people you might recognize, and filled with ads and product placement. This is our future. It sucks, huh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We’re in the first video game console generation where prices are going up instead of coming down. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-deal-discount-tariffs-xbox-switch-2-trump-1851778878">It’s rough out there</a>, especially if you were someone who was waiting on the sidelines for the right deal before finally buying a Nintendo Switch or upgrading to a PS5. But the good news is that even if <em>new</em> consoles keep getting more expensive, used versions have never been more affordable.</p> <p>If you asked me for the best deal in gaming right now, I’d probably say the Switch Lite. It arrived back in 2019 and as low-end dedicated gaming handhelds go, it performs decently well. Best of all, it has access to one of the best gaming libraries ever assembled. If you’ve never owned a Switch before, you can instantly start playing anything from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and<em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> to <em>Hades</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> on one of the most convenient form factors around. The only downside is that despite coming out six years ago, it’s never received a price cut. In fact, following Nintendo’s latest price hikes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">response to tariffs</a>, it’s now $230 to buy new.</p> <p>Used, however, you can get one in decent shape for just $100. According to reseller pricing data logged on <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-lite-gray">Price Charts</a>, that’s around the lowest it’s ever been, and prices don’t seem likely to spike again in the near future. It’s a similar story for the base model Switch with the blue and red Joy-Con. Recently raised to $340 new, you can get one for <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-with-blue-and-red-joy-con-version-2">less than half that used</a>. Prices for other older used consoles are also at all-time lows. A 1TB PS4 Slim hovers just above $100 right now. The cheapest Xbox One right now is just $98. Some of the newer consoles have decent used discounts as well.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614754">Price Charts / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Lets start with the Xbox Series S. It launched at $300, was frequently on sale for $250, and is now going for $380 new at GameStop. That’s nuts! The whole point of the Series S is that it can’t play discs or run games at 4K but it can give you convenient access to all of the great stuff that rotates through Game Pass. Used, however, the Series S remains a great bargain. While it once dipped down to as low as $160 in 2023, it’s still easy to find second-hand <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-s-console">for around $200</a>. That makes it the cheapest way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> when it comes to Xbox this month. <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/xbox-series-x/xbox-series-x-1tb-console">At around $375</a>, a used Xbox Series X is nearly double the price, but still way less than its current $600 MSRP.</p> <p>The PS5 is, surprisingly, an even better used deal than the Series X, probably in part because there’s way more of them floating around in the first place. Sony hasn’t raised the prices on its hardware in the U.S. yet and you can still grab one of the new <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 slim bundles for just $450. Used, the slim with a disc drive <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-slim-disc-edition">runs about $330</a>, while the all-digital base PS5 can be found <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/playstation-5-console-digital-version">for $300 or lower</a>. That’s only a third off the sticker price, but still not bad. At $70 each, that’s the same as buying both<em> Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> new this fall.</p> <p>There’s sometimes been a stigma around buying used consoles. GameStop refusing to price them competitively is part of that. You also don’t always know how well looked-after a system was. Has it been overheating from dust-clogged fans? <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470">Is it infested with bugs</a>? My personal experience with used consoles in the modern era has been quite positive, though. A used Xbox One I purchased in the mid aughts lasted me until I traded it in toward my Series S. A Switch I bought on Facebook last Christmas for just $200 (it also included <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and Switch Sports) still feels practically brand new.</p> <p>The only used console you can’t get a deal on right now is the Switch 2. Even pre-owned versions are going for over the current $450 MSRP. It’ll probably only get worse if and when Nintendo eventually raises that price as well. Fortunately, at least for now, most of the games worth playing on Switch 2 are still available on Switch 1.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980">President Trump</a> was spotted earlier today wandering around on the roof of the White House. It wasn’t immediately clear why. He might have been surveying the nearby grounds for his proposed $200 million ballroom building that would be nearly twice the size of the White House itself. Or maybe the purported leader of the free world, having recently suffered a string of self-inflicted owns, was simply losing it.</p> <p>The latest sign we are deeply cooked as a nation came as the White House press pool berated the 79-year-old <a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-verdict-guilty-hush-money-trial-phoenix-wright-1851510635">convicted felon</a> with important questions ranging from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/donald-trump-mental-fitness">What are you doing up there?</a>” to “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/gaza-american-democracy-test/">Do you approve of Netanyahu taking over all of Gaza?</a>” At some point Trump was asked what he was trying to build. He tried to shout something incomprehensible about nuclear missiles in response. He pointed up at the sky. Welcome to the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>The contradictions continue to heighten. Who among us can turn away? Each new day presents the American people with some fresh and often morally abominable stupidity to leer at:</p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6YiAW1agsN">https://t.co/6YiAW1agsN</a> <a href="https://t.co/k099T14SIs">pic.twitter.com/k099T14SIs</a></p> <p>— Jéferfon Menezes (@JefinhoMenes) <a href="https://twitter.com/JefinhoMenes/status/1952751166577623068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>          <p>It’s possible the rooftop stroll is evidence of a man losing his grip not just on reality but on his poll numbers too. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/polling-tariffs-trump-analysis">Trump’s agenda</a>–lawless ICE arrests, tax cuts for the rich, tariffs for everyone else–is underwater with nearly every slice of the public. The Epstein files remain MIA even as questions mount, much to his base’s disbelief. Amid all this winning is one crazy gambit after another, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/04/nasa-china-space-station-duffy-directives-00492172">including building a nuclear reactor on the moon</a>.</p> <p>Where will Trump pop up next? Will he return to the golf course to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-golf-score-cheating-bedminster-b2801223.html">get creative again</a> with his sandtrap ball placement? Will he go back to a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/trump-pennsylvania-mcdonalds-visit/">marveling at the fry grill at McDonalds</a>? He has a Twitch streamer’s knack for marrying the faux-improv of manufactured reality TV with genuinely unpredictable WTF moments. Pay no attention to the fact that the price of things like ground beef (and the original Switch) <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112">just hit record highs</a>.</p>
