One of them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bimfli-and-his-time-travels-japan-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bimfli-and-his-time-travels-japan-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bimfli &amp; His Time Travels: Japan</em></a></span>, features screenshots that seem to all be made using AI-generated imagery of children. The game was developed by Aldora Games, a studio that has released nearly <em>80</em> games since February 2023. And almost all of them are storybook games that use AI-generated art or reuse assets. </p><p>As we get closer to Christmas, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/search/#q=christmas&amp;p=1&amp;cat=gme&amp;sort=rd&amp;f=corePlatforms%2Cavailability&amp;corePlatforms=Nintendo+Switch&amp;availability=Available+now%2CNew+releases&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/search/#q=christmas&amp;p=1&amp;cat=gme&amp;sort=rd&amp;f=corePlatforms%2Cavailability&amp;corePlatforms=Nintendo+Switch&amp;availability=Available+now%2CNew+releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can also find a lot of holiday-themed slop</a></span>, often priced low and relying on AI art to hopefully entice a parent or kid to spend a few bucks on some entertainment. Except you won’t get much holly jolly enjoyment out of most of these “games,” as they are just barely interactive storybooks with AI-generated text or public domain stories included. The ones that aren’t just boring storybooks appear to be bland-looking mobile game ports or hastily developed asset flips. </p><p>And what makes me sad is that as I  dug through all the slop and scams, I saw real games made by small teams trying to break through all the garbage. People desperately trying to succeed as piles of sewage get dumped on them while Nintendo looks on and does nothing.</p><p>What sucks is that the Switch 2 is likely to inherit this store, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-release-date-1851690470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-release-date-1851690470">Nintendo is going to support backward compatibility</a></span> on its next-gen machine.

But <em>Rivals</em> uses it differently from what you might expect. The game uses Ace two separate ways. One refers to more of a title or status, while the other refers to a specific gameplay situation. The identical naming has certainly caused some confusion for players. </p><h2 id="h10505"><a id="score"></a>What does ‘Ace’ mean on a scoreboard?</h2><p>The first usage of Ace you’ll likely see is on the scoreboard. Check in midway through a match, and you’ll see one player on each team with the word displayed over their character portrait. <strong>Whichever player has the Ace term is essentially the one performing the best.</strong> If they keep the title throughout the match, they’ll likely be who you see as the MVP or SVP. Those familiar with <em>Overwatch</em> will recognize this as similar to the On Fire system.</p><p>The scoreboard is pretty minimal on details for other players otherwise. If you’re wondering how Ace is determined and why someone with fewer kills than you has the title, it’s likely because they made up for it with better heals, more blocked damage, or more time on the objective.</p><h2 id="h10506"><a id="kill"></a>How to get an ‘Ace Kill’</h2><figure id="" data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-recommend-id="image://04a980bef0f12a0147c20037a3a1c5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Psylocke runs toward her team during a match, with “Ace!” displayed at the top of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll also see the term pop up in the middle of your screen during a match sometimes. <strong>It’s a little awkward, but Ace is also used as the name of <em>Marvel Rival</em>’s version of a team kill.</strong> Don’t worry, it’s not like you have to solo the whole team yourself. You’ll be notified that an Ace occurred even if you’re walking back from the respawn area.</p><p>Of course, actively participating and taking out most of the enemy team does feel pretty great. The best way to do this is to work together with your teammates and coordinate your attacks. That’s easier when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183">playing with friends</a></span>, but the Ping system is still useful for relaying information. Having one person immobilize the opponents while someone else picks them off is always a great strategy. Making a move when the other team is all concentrated in one area is also a wonderful opportunity to make use of.</p><p><strong>The easiest way to get an Ace kill is to use ultimate abilities at the right moment.</strong> Most will dish out a lot of damage quickly or over a large area. Be smart with them and you can KO multiple players in one go. The following are ones that I’ve seen lead to an Ace kill the most often:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">Jeff The Land Shark</a></span> – It’s Jeff!</li><li>Moon Knight – Hand of Khonshu</li><li>Psylocke – Dance of the Butterfly</li><li>Scarlet Witch – Reality Erasure</li><li>Spider-Man – Spectacular Spin</li><li>Storm – Omega Hurricane</li></ul><p>We don’t know if Ace will remain the name for these two situations in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>as the game continues to receive updates. Gaining the Ace status on the scoreboard after helping to get an unrelated-in-name Ace kill is pretty confusing. Either way, I hope you can come away from this with a better understanding of both.

But if Microsoft can truly integrate the experience across every device it’s available on, the whole could end up being more meaningful than the sum of its parts.</p><p>This would be Microsoft bringing its original “play anywhere” perk to its ultimate conclusion: Buy a game from Xbox and it follows you around wherever you’re playing, whether that’s a TV, console, PC, or that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-pc-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-game-pass-1851697278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-pc-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-game-pass-1851697278">new gaming handheld Microsoft is tinkering away on</a></span>. <em>Windows Central</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a></span> that another initiative currently underway at the company is called Project Rainway. It’s aimed at a unified UI for Xbox across different platforms where friends lists, messages, game lists, and save progress seamlessly flow between devices. </p><p>It’s an ambitious idea that, as <em>Windows Central</em> notes, comes with plenty of its own risks if Microsoft isn’t 100 percent committed to delivering on it. Abandoning any one aspect of a play everywhere mantra degrades the value of the entire thing, and Microsoft has been anything but consistent this console generation.
