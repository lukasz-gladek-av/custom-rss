              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch-price-release-date-2000672803"><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i></a><span> are coming to Switch tomorrow, February 27, and if you’ve never played the 2004 remakes, or by some wild circumstance </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975"><span>never got around to the original games</span></a><span>, you’re in for a treat. These games are widely considered the “definitive” versions of the first </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs, and still feel pretty modern by today’s standards. But like all </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, the reason there are two versions is so you’re incentivized to trade with others, as some monsters are only catchable in one version or the other.</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes your favorite Pokémon might be trapped on one version, so it’s good to know ahead of time which game has which exclusive monsters before you buy one or the other, especially if you don’t have a friend to buy the other version and trade with. Here’s the rundown:</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[MrBeast Employee Accused Of Insider Trading For Betting $4,000 With ‘Near-Perfect Success’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-editor-insider-trading-kalshi-artem-kaptur-2000674023</link>
            <guid>1447108</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kalshi, the self-described “trade on anything” betting website, has accused Artem Kaptur, an editor for James “MrBeast” Donaldson’s YouTube channel, of insider trading and plans to fine him “5 times the initial trade size” of the $4,000 he spent betting on MrBeast-related trades. Kalshi’s </span><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-trading-violation-enforcement-cases"><span>blog post</span></a><span> states that Kaptur was identified as an insider trader due to his “near-perfect trading success on markets with low odds.”</span></p> <p><span>Kalshi has been the center of several controversies for its willingness to let users bet on a variety of topics, including wagers </span><a href="https://therealnews.com/cnn-partners-kalshi-gambling-app-starvation-gaza"><span>such as</span></a><span> “Will the IPC classify Gaza as experiencing famine this year?” However, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/25/nx-s1-5726050/kalshi-insider-trading-enforcement-actions"><i><span>NPR</span></i></a><span>, it seems they take insider trading a little bit more seriously than people starving to death, as Kalshi just announced that they’ll be suspending the account of MrBeast’s editor for “statistically anomalous” betting practices.</span></p>

 <p><span>Artem Kaptur has responded to the allegations in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/anokiiiiii/status/2026908606327828685"><span>X</span></a><span>, in which he states that he’ll be taking “full responsibility” for the bets placed on Kalshi’s platform. That being said, Kaptur’s post also states that Kalshi’s decision to refer the details of the case to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been “devastating.” “I am not saying I did not deserve consequences. I am saying that watching your entire career collapse, your reputation destroyed publicly, and your name attached to the word ‘illegal’ in headlines across the internet for something that legal experts themselves are still debating is a lot to process.”</span></p> <p><span>Kaptur’s post also confirms that MrBeast’s team has parted ways with him following the allegations. In a follow-up post on X, Kaptur thanked commenters and stated that he is “going to fight this issue with the support from you all,” alongside the code for his crypto wallet address. An official spokesperson for Beast Industries </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mrbeast-editor-accused-insider-trading-kalshi-1236515316/"><span>announced</span></a><span> that the company has “no tolerance” for Kaptur’s actions. “We’ve already initiated an independent investigation as part of our overall ongoing efforts to ensure the integrity of our workplace and trust with our global audiences.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Tomorrow is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary</span></a><span>, and The Pokémon Company is going all out to commemorate the big date. There’s a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>livestream tomorrow</span></a><span> to reveal upcoming projects, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-art-logos-every-pokedex-serebii-2000672767"><span>new art for all 1000+ monsters circulating social media</span></a><span>, and anniversary merchandise that includes throwbacks to the past 30 years of history. Now that we’ve seen some of that merch, y’all, I need the black-and-white Pikachu plush made to look like the little guy’s original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975"><span>Game Boy</span></a><span> sprite.</span></p> <p><a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2088734.html"><i><span>Game Watch</span></i></a><span> attended an anniversary event in Japan that showcased several of the upcoming merchandise collaborations, and it’s unclear at the moment how many of these are coming stateside, but we might hear more in the next day or so when Pokémon Day actually begins. Some standouts include charms and art based on every box art from the mainline games, a line of camping equipment with the original Kanto starters on them, and the previously announced Fat Pikachu plush that harkens back to the mouse’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fat-pikachu-chunkachu-pokemon-30th-plush-2000661861"><span>original round design</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real winner is the pixelated Pikachu plush that carries all the distinct features the mouse had in the original games, long before it was morphed into the universal design we see today. The plush is missing the iconic yellow and red color scheme because it’s made to look like the critter’s sprite on the original Game Boy, which only displayed games in a monochrome color scheme. But it also has some features that have been phased out of the character’s design over the years, such as the colored paws and grey circle on the belly, though those elements have been retained by Raichu, its evolution. God, I shudder to think of how much that is going to cost on import and resale sites. Please come to the States, grey Pikachu. My shelf calls to you.</span></p> <p><span>You can check out </span><i><span>Game Watch</span></i><span>’s gallery to see the full line of products that were shown off, as well as some photos from the event.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Highguard Mode Nixes Looting And Ratchets Up The Action As It Hangs On For Dear Life]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-patch-note-mode-ps5-2000674000</link>
            <guid>1447027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Highguard</em> is changing up its menu in what could be <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">a last-ditch effort</a> to gain some traction as its player count continues to dwindle. A new mode dispenses with the looting phase entirely and will just have players raiding each others’ bases back and forth, nixing the phases that bored some players back at launch.</p> <p>Here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791475413365&amp;emgid=518613785064243442">Wildlight Entertainment’s description</a> of Raid Rush which goes live later today as part of the hero shooter’s latest update:</p> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0">In Raid Rush, 2 teams of 5 players will take turns attacking and defending their bases with no pesky looting phase in between.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Instead, select your base and use Trader Flynn to upgrade your weapons and equipment in a round based format. After each round, you’ll switch sides between attacking and defending. Your base walls and generators will be repaired, and you’ll be rewarded some Vesper to spend at the Trader, who will have different offers after every round. And don’t worry about buying armor – everyone has the same armor, and it will escalate in rarity as the rounds progress.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Raid Rush will be an interesting experiment to see if <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> can be more appealing to players if they don’t have to wrap their heads around all of the map exploration, looting, and capture-the-flag mechanics in the first two thirds of each match. Personally, those are my favorite parts. One of the best things about <em>Highguard</em> are its mounts and those won’t be a part of Raid Rush at all.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The new update will also re-balance a few items and weapons. The Revive Amulet now gives a much smaller speed boost to the process of resurrecting fallen allies, and the Vanguard, by far the most dominant rifle in the game, has had its long-range damage taken down a notch. Similarly, the Dynasty, which has some wicked recoil, will now do increased damage to make up for the unwieldiness of it.</p> <h2 data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"><i>Highguard</i> is hanging on by a thread</h2> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">If you play <em>Highguard</em> multiple times a week like I still do, the balance changes are good ones and the new mode will be interesting to try out, even if it’s fundamentally not what I want out of the game. But most people who gave it a shot at launch aren’t playing anymore. This week’s update is another incremental update that does little to address the lack of items and heroes the game needs to in order to feel more fully featured.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The game’s concurrent numbers on Steam have continued to fall off a cliff. <em>Highguard</em> started February at 15,000 concurrent players daily on PC. It’s now bobbing around just 500. The game seems to be doing better on console. Mat Piscatella shared with <em>Kotaku</em> that according to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker, <em>Highguard</em> was the 34th most played game on PS5 in the U.S. for the week ending February 14 based on weekly active users.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Anecdotally, I’ve never waited more than a few seconds during matchmaking on console, so despite all of the grim forecasts, it certainly <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">doesn’t feel like a dead game on console yet</a>. I would love for <em>Highguard</em> to recover somehow because, despite its shortcomings, I’ve been having a great time playing it. But games in its predicament need tons of runway or a major momentum-shifting boost, and so far <em>Highguard</em> doesn’t have either of those.</p>
