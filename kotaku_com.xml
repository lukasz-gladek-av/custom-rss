              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> just swept at The Game Awards. French studio Sandfall Interactive—the devs behind this stylistic turn-based RPG—set a record for the show winning in nine separate categories including Game of the Year. Want to see what all the fuss is about? Secure yourself an Xbox Series X to play it in beautiful 4K. The full MSRP as of late has been $650 for Xbox’s most elite gaming console. However for a limited time, Amazon is selling it for an 8% discount. This shaves the price down by $50, bringing it to just $600.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s take a quick detour into the Xbox Series X’s price history. Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the former of which was priced at just $500. Back in May, Microsoft announced the company would be increasing the console prices, which raised the Series X by a whole $100 to $600. Then just a couple months back, they did it again—by $50 to $650. This might just be the only console generation to see it’s systems go up in price rather than down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">So with all that said, this discount does save you $50, by bringing the Xbox consoles back down to it’s Spring and Summer MSRP.</a></p>

<h2>Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p>When looking at the Xbox Series X next to it’s more affordable counterpart—the Xbox Series S—you’ll find some substantial perks that justifies the price gap. For one, the Xbox Series X can play games in 4K resolutions. Both consoles are capable of running games with fast refresh rates of up to 120fps and support HDR content.</p>
<p>The Series X is also equipped with a disc drive. If you value keeping a physical collection of your games, the the Xbox Series X is the way to go. It’s also good to have at least one Blu-ray player in the house and this console can be that for your home.</p>



<p>Both the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S makes use of the Xbox Velocity Architecture. This Microsoft tech is what makes the consoles super-fast load times possible. It also allows support for Quick Resume. This feature allows you to hop back and forth between games without having to close out or restart them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="129" data-end="949">If you’ve never spent time using a curved monitor, it’s easy to assume the design is just a marketing trick. I used to think the same until I started gaming on one myself. Once you’re positioned at the ideal distance and angle, the curve subtly pulls you into whatever you’re playing or watching in a way that a flat screen doesn’t quite match. The viewing experience feels more natural as the display envelopes your view. Curved monitors have come down in price over the last several years, so they’re far more accessible additions to gaming setups today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">A great example is the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor, which is currently 28% off.</a> Although it normally lists for $699 on Amazon, the discount drops it to just $500—leaving you with an extra $199 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="993" data-end="1509">Alienware’s 34-inch OLED monitor makes a strong first impression through its sheer size and shape. The ultrawide screen features a 1800R curvature, a design meant to better align with the natural way our eyes perceive the world. We don’t see our surroundings in a flat rectangle; our view is curved and panoramic. That’s why displays like this can make games feel more cinematic and immersive. The curved layout draws your attention toward the center while still keeping peripheral details within comfortable view.</p>

<h2 data-start="993" data-end="1509">Lag-Free Gameplay</h2>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">In terms of performance, the monitor delivers a crisp QHD 1440p resolution, backed by a fast 165 Hz maximum refresh rate. This combination ensures smooth, responsive motion, which is especially valuable in fast-paced games. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync both work to reduce stuttering and eliminate screen tearing for a consistently fluid gaming experience.</p>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">Remarkably, this monitor’s input time i just 0.1ms. You read that right. Not 1ms, but 0.1ms. You kind of don’t realize just what a game changer a good response time is until you’ve experienced it, and this is the industry’s fastest.</p>


<p data-start="1950" data-end="2355">We also know extended screen time can strain your eyes, particularly with bright displays. For long sessions—whether you’re gaming, editing, or working—the Alienware curved monitor includes hardware-driven blue light reduction settings accessible through its onboard console. This helps maintain visual comfort while still delivering rich colors and contrast, so you don’t have to sacrifice image quality.</p>
<p data-start="2357" data-end="2881">Connectivity is another strong point. On the back, you’ll find an HDMI ports and two DisplayPorts, allowing you to connect multiple devices simultaneously. You might use it primarily with your gaming PC, while also keeping something like a Nintendo Switch 2 plugged in and ready. Switching between inputs is seamless, saving you from unplugging cables or rearranging your entire setup. The monitor also includes multiple USB ports for added convenience.</p>
<p data-start="3089" data-end="3252" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor for just $500—a strong value for anyone looking to make the best of their gaming experience.</a></p>
