            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies pumping hundreds of billions in investment into new generative AI tools and LLM models promote it as a sea change technology that will be as revolutionary as the introduction of the desktop computer. Even some game industry figures believe it will usher in a new era in which games are made better, quicker, and more cheaply, democratizing development for creatives without hundred-person teams behind them. For indie publisher Tim Bender, the recent explosion in AI slop has been nothing but a headache. “If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult.”</p> <p>The label he helps run as CEO, Hooded Horse, struck gold after signing the medieval base-builder mega hit <em>Manor Lords</em>, but its library of published games has grown far beyond it in the past two years with releases like the Lego-like tower-defense game<em>&nbsp;Cataclismo</em>, the economic management sim <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em>, and the 4X sequel <em>Endless Legend 2</em>. Being strategy games isn’t the only thing they all have in common. They also all adhere to a strict ban on generative AI art.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is getting accused of using Gen AI. <a href="https://t.co/fa2E79X8as">pic.twitter.com/fa2E79X8as</a></p> <p>— Shooter Intel (@ShooterIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShooterIntel/status/2003067393141346461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways…suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told me in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'”</p>

 <p>It turns out that just saying no to gen AI is the easy part. Actually trying to enforce a ban is where things can get tricky. There’s no magical machine you can put a game through to detect if it has generative AI content in it. Platforms like Steam, which require disclosures for the use of such content, basically operate on good faith that developers will be honest about what’s in their games. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> briefly had AI placeholder art in one part of the game at launch before it was eventually pulled, but that box on the Steam page was never checked.</p>

 <p>Production can be messy enough even within small studios. Development teams working with freelancers or outsource companies, as many indies do, will have an even harder time maintaining checks throughout the production pipeline to weed out any gen AI art usage.</p>

 <h2>“[Gen AI art] is cancerous”</h2> <p>“We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender told me. “Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “because of that, we’re constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it’s cancerous.”</p> <p>Hooded Horse, which already this year helped usher the grand strategy sci-fi game <em>Terra Invicta</em> out of Early Access and into its 1.0 release, employs two full-time artists who help with all of the publisher’s marketing art, which can include appearances in showcases and announcements for things like Xbox Game Pass launches. “It would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this,” Bender said.</p>

   <p>His point of view isn’t one you hear a whole lot among the video game industry’s giants. EA is all in on the potential for AI to make its loot-box-driven sports franchises even more lucrative. Embark Studios, maker of last year’s mega-hit <em>Arc Raiders</em>, continues to shrug off complaints about the game’s use of generative-AI voice performances.</p> <p>“We don’t use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors,” CEO Patrick Söderlund recently told <em><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-target="true">GamesBeat</a></em>. “People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion.”</p> <h2>It’s about good ethics, not bad PR</h2> <p>There’s also a sense among some developers that everyone else is rushing to embrace the AI revolution, and anyone who doesn’t will find themselves left behind in a landscape that’s increasingly competitive and hostile to new game releases. “Korea is reportedly one of the countries where ChatGPT is used most actively,” Sean Kim, the co-CEO of <em>Lies of P</em> publisher Neowiz, told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2026/01/05/ceo-of-lies-of-p-publisher-neowiz-talks-2025-overture-expansion"><em>Game Informer</em></a>. “It’s hard to find a game company here today that isn’t using AI in some way. At the very least, companies are using either ChatGPT or Gemini.”</p>

 <p>Even some acclaimed GOTY winners have been captured by this mindset. “Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make,” <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> director Swen Vincke posted <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">on X last month</a>. “In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p> <p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p> <p>I was asked explicitly about concept art…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Larian Studios cofounder was responding to controversy that had erupted over previous remarks that suggested gen-AI would be used in the making of the studio’s next RPG, <em>Divinity</em>. Vincke promised no gen-AI assets in the finished game but suggested artists might experiment with it during the exploratory phase of development. For Hooded Horse, the issue with gen AI isn’t just about skepticism over its usefulness or potential backlash from players, it’s about the moral issues surrounding tools trained on plagiarizing other people’s work.</p>

 <p>“When it comes to gen-AI, it’s not a PR issue, it’s an ethics issue,” Bender said. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year, after half a decade away, <em>Star Wars</em> returns to theaters with <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-trailer-reactions-2000627675">The Mandalorian and Grogu.</a>&nbsp;</em>But after that movie, 2027 will see another <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-starfighter-mia-goth-ryan-gosling-shawn-levy-1851783918"><em>Star Wars</em> entry hit theaters: <em>Starfighter</em></a>. According to the film’s director, <em>Deadpool Vs Wolverin</em>e’s Shawn Levy, one scene in the upcoming sci-fi sequel was filmed by superstar Tom Cruise. Really.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/movies/shawn-levy-star-wars-stranger-things.html">In a new interview with </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/movies/shawn-levy-star-wars-stranger-things.html">The New York Times</a>,</em> Levy talked about the pressure he’s under making <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOtlyDdDxnw/">a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie starring Ryan Gosling,</a> as well as the excitement of getting to work on the sci-fi mega-franchise. He also told the newspaper that various big names have visited the <em>Starfighter</em> set, including Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. The most surprising bit? Cruise actually ended up filming a bit of the movie after Levy made a joke about the mayor of Hollywood grabbing a camera.</p>

 <p>As Levy tells it, Cruise arrived on set in November and after getting welcomed by the cast with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-games-ps2-n64-mobile-final-reckoning-1851781905"><em>Mission Impossible</em></a> theme song, started watching as Levy set up a lightsaber duel in a muddy lake. Levy joked to Cruise to get in and help with the cameras, and apparently, the superstar takes everything at face value. So he reportedly grabbed a camera and hopped into the water, ruining his shoes in the process, in order to get the perfect shot.</p>

 <p>“Now, when you see the movie,” Levy told the <em>NYT</em>,&nbsp; “you’ll know that part of it was shot by Tom. I mean, how cool is that?”</p>  <p>It’s wild, for sure, but the more interesting information is Levy confirming a lightsaber duel in <em>Starfighter</em>. Many had wondered if the Jedi would appear in this film, which is set a few years after <em>Rise of Skywalker.</em> And while a lightsaber duel doesn’t confirm Jedi are involved, it does make it seem far more likely that some Force-wielding folk will be showing up in <em>Starfighter</em>.</p>

 <p>The question now is who will be swinging those laserswords and why? Is <em>Starfighter</em> actually (secretly)<em> Star Wars Episode 10</em>, as some fans have wildly speculated? Or will two people who have no history with a lightsaber be fighting in a swamp? Is Rey showing up in this movie? We’ll have to wait until next year to find out. Let’s hope Tom Cruise is a good cameraman.</p>

              <p>A mistake we’ve all been making in our responses to the rise of AI slop is deriding it on the basis of its embarrassing mistakes and nauseating uncanniness. The reality is that the tech is improving at an astonishing rate, going from seventeen-fingered body horror images to borderline-convincing live-action film in just a couple of years. It will get better still, and all the while remain an uncreative and immoral act of plagiarism and wanton destruction of both the environment and creative jobs. So while a new AI-generated video doing the rounds showing a fake live-action trailer for a <em>Legend of </em><em>Zelda</em> movie might still have much to mock, that’s really not the issue here. The issue is how clearly it reveals the entire gen-AI grift.</p> <p>The self-named “PJ Ace,” CEO of [grits teeth] viral AI video company Genre.ai, has <a href="https://x.com/PJaccetturo/status/2008559114704875888">posted a thread to X</a> to boast about how he was able to make a trailer for a <em>Zelda</em> movie in just five days, and for only $300, using a suite of AI tools within Freepik. There’s so much to unpack here, but let’s start with the video itself.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo took 40 years to give us a Legend of Zelda movie.</p> <p>I made this in 5 days on a $300 budget. </p> <p>It looks like a $300M blockbuster.</p> <p>Let me show you how I made this in 5 simple steps inside of Freepik: 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/DgkdPDPyGA">pic.twitter.com/DgkdPDPyGA</a></p> <p>— PJ Ace (@PJaccetturo) <a href="https://twitter.com/PJaccetturo/status/2008559114704875888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You know, when it comes to making the most immediate criticism of the footage, I can’t really improve on the reaction from <em>New York Times</em> tech writer Mike Isaac:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">incredible narrative work if your audience largely lacks object permanence <a href="https://t.co/o5FSDY4Khr">https://t.co/o5FSDY4Khr</a></p> <p>— rat king 🐀 (@MikeIsaac) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/2009003874686996706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Like pretty much every so-called AI film you’ll see, characters will change their appearance from shot to shot, because generative AI has no concept of what it’s generating, and so cannot compare one moment to the next. Hence, despite some moments of utterly convincing photorealism, this whole two-minute slopfest makes no coherent visual sense. I mean, go ahead and pick your favorite fake actor who shows up throughout.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658176">© PJ Ace / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yet, as flawed as that is, this is <em>way</em> better than videos we were seeing just last year. These faces are at least similar (if still obviously different, from nose and mouth shape to complexion), given they’re all based on the same “reference material” (pictures of real actors who weren’t asked), and this element of the tech will also get better, fast.</p>

 <p>And let’s not be in denial. There are moments in this clip that are&nbsp;<em>really</em> impressive given that they were entirely created by computerized plagiarism. That’s in some part due to the fact that a human put a vague amount of effort in, rather than just leaving a machine to run away with its own delusions unguided, as “Ace” lays out in his thread. It did, after all, take five days to put together, and a whole bunch of money was spent on credits to speed up the processing. There are also moments that look embarrassingly poor, the sorts of things that would see a real trailer dragged across the internet until the film’s creators promised to go back and fix things.</p>

 <p>So, altogether it took $300, five days, three different AI tools, and one boiled ocean. And for what? No, seriously, for what?</p> <h2>Sloppy Drivel</h2> <p>I’m not going to argue this took away jobs. Pajamas Ace was never going to make this mock trailer if it involved standing up, let alone casting, lighting, make-up, set building, VFX, post-processing, editing rushes, and the huge amounts of money it would have taken to create the above <em>without</em> all the shitty bits. The bits like the awful-looking blood, crappy Moblin animation, that moment where Link looks like a cartoon at the end, and his apparently just shooting Ganon with a single arrow to win. Oh, and my favorite bit is when Link fires that arrow and, rather than the arrow moving, Link’s hand just explodes instead.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658189"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658189">© PJ Ace / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But of course, this is also all about the <em>potential</em> of destroyed jobs, of sacrificing hands-on creativity, human inspiration, improvisational talent, and tangible reality for the sake of sloppy drivel that superficially looks like cinema. You know every movie studio head is watching this garbage and having dollar signs appear in their eyes with a loud “ker-ching!” like they’re a cartoon pig, wondering how long it can be before they can do away with the pesky expenses of dolly grips, second-unit assistant directors, and most of all, those infuriating actors and directors with their heads full of ideas. This is about an existential threat to an entire industry.</p> <h2>Degenerative AI</h2> <p>Getting back to that original X post, let’s go through it line by line because it reveals so, so much about the AI-brainwormed:</p> <blockquote><p>“<span>Nintendo took 40 years to give us a Legend of Zelda movie.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Um, no, that’s not true&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. Nintendo didn’t want to make a&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie until very recently, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-movie-mario-switch-marvel-1851000791">announced this intention in 2023</a>. Last year <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-nintendo-lead-actors-benjamin-ainsworth-1851786373">we received casting information</a>, and toward the end of 2025 <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816">we saw sneak glimpses from filming</a>. The final film is <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-movie-delay-date-nintendo-avengers-secret-wars-1851784080">due to be released in May 2027</a>, meaning short of any further delays, Nintendo will have taken <em>four</em> years to give us a&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie. Let alone that it’s silly to pretend the five days to make this rubbish would be comparable to the 40 years since&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> was created.</p>

 <blockquote><p><span>“I made this in 5 days on a $300 budget.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>A computer made it, with PJ rearranging AI-generated images using the likenesses of the movie’s real-world actors without permission. There wasn’t a “budget,” that was just how much he spent on tokens by the time it was done.</p> <blockquote><p><span>“It looks like a $300M blockbuster.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>It looks like an Uwe Boll movie trailer, lasting less than two minutes, with no discernible plot or character development. It in no sense, from any angle, looks like a $300 million blockbuster, and nor does it look like the trailer for one. It’s very technically impressive stuff given how dreadful gen-AI clips were a couple of years back, but that is very much it.</p>

 <p>And it’s all part of the grift. Scour X and you’ll find thousands of examples of people’s thrown-together gen-AI “trailers,” and precisely zero 110-minute movies. (Don’t actually scour X, to be clear, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/">because&nbsp;<em>fucking hell</em></a>.) This tech is only capable of creating the implication of something real and never the real thing itself. It’s a tissue-thin veneer, all promises and no delivery.</p> <p>A trailer is a promise of a movie to come. A gen-AI trailer is the final product; an empty, plotless, largely incoherent collection of striking clips, edited together in a way that matches our understanding of the language of trailers, and as such is engineered to tell our brains that it’s a taster of something far larger and more significant. It’s a con, a wheeze, and it’s always the act of those invested in the gen-AI industry rather than impassioned creators with a story to tell.</p> <p>These clips will get better and better, look more and more realistic, and the result will be a more convincing promise with exactly the same lack of any delivery. Our new friend PJ Ace and the legions of AI bros congratulating him in the replies on X won’t be going on to make a full-length movie using these tools, because that’s a whole different act, one born of creativity. Scanning a bunch of <em>Zelda</em> assets and a couple of actor’s faces, then arranging the results in the shape of something that reminds us of a trailer, is the opposite—it’s cynicism.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</span></i><span>, the latest game in the narrative-driven adventure game series,</span> <span>ended on a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215"><span>in 2024</span></a><span>. It’s little surprise, then, that despite some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-strange-double-exposure-award-gdc-2025-layoffs-1851771282"><span>strife at developer Deck Nine Games</span></a><span>, it seems–based on a leaked PEGI rating that has been since yoinked off the rating board’s official site–to be getting a sequel. Despite Square Enix’s efforts to plug the leak, the </span><a href="https://x.com/DomTheBomb/status/2009008464127721907"><span>internet remembers all</span></a><span>, so we know the game is apparently going to be called </span><i><span>Life Is Strange: Reunion</span></i><span>, and we also know a bit about the game’s premise thanks to an accompanying synopsis. Some folks are probably celebrating what </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span> might entail, but I have questions.</span></p>  <p><span>The full summary that was removed from the PEGI site reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>So there’s a lot to unpack in these few sentences, but to get the obvious out of the way, the “reunion” the game’s title seems to refer to is one between Max and Chloe, the two leads of the original </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>. At the end of that game, you make a choice that either sees Chloe die or sees the two ride off to an unknown future together, though if you choose the latter, the events of </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>find the two characters taking some time apart. The decision was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-chloe-relationship-1851673763"><span>unpopular with long-time fans</span></a><span>, but </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>did suggest that the two may reunite down the line, and even if I was bummed that Chloe wasn’t in the game, I admired </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>’s commitment to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><span>respecting both endings</span></a><span> of the original. Now, however, it sounds like Chloe will be part of </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span>, perhaps regardless of whatever the player did in the 2015 original?</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that Deck Nine had players import the Chloe choice into </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span> through an early dialogue option makes me hopeful the team isn’t just throwing away the possibility that Chloe died at the end of the first game in reaction to the backlash it got for omitting Max’s foul-mouthed, punk rock best (girl)friend. The line in the synopsis about Chloe being “haunted by nightmares and impossible memories” makes me wonder if some time travel nonsense could be used to make Chloe show up in </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>even if you did choose the ending in which she dies. Perhaps these “impossible memories” are ones involving both versions of events? </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>has a lot of timeline jumping; maybe this could have affected Chloe as a character existing in many quantum states due to Max’s time traveling?</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, games that undermine player choice are a pet peeve of mine, which is a big reason why I’m anxious about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><i><span>Mass Effect 5</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><span>There are a lot of fans who would be content if BioWare just declared one of the original trilogy’s final decisions canon and picked it up from there, so it seems like a real possibility, but I’m not one of them. It was encouraging to see Deck Nine make a big hoopla of maintaining </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>’s continuity in </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>, and I hope the team has put in the effort to carry it through to </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>as well. Hopefully we don’t have to wait too long to find out more about this game. The thought of speculating about this for several months is already making my head hurt.</span></p>

              <p>There is still some good left in this world. We’re getting a new, still officially untitled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133"><em>Jackass</em></a>, and we don’t have to wait a decade like last time. The new comedy is set to arrive in June.</p> <p>On January 8, <em>Jackass</em> ringleader Johnny Knoxville <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTPFikrEXfX/?img_index=1">posted the iconic skull and crutches logo</a> for the franchise on Instagram, with the date June 26 below it. In the text for the post, he confirmed that, yes, a new <em>Jackass</em> movie is a go. Expect lots of wild stunts, gross moments, and of course, some injuries.</p>   <p>“Well, a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” said Knoxville on Instagram. “We wanted to let you know that this summer, Jackass is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come, but wanted you to hear it from us first!”</p> <p>That’s all the official information we have at the moment. We don’t know who is returning or which guest stars will be making an appearance in the upcoming comedy flick. In the last movie, 2022’s<em> Jackass Forever</em>, most of the original <em>Jackass</em> crew from the 2000s era TV show on MTV returned, with the notable exceptions of Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. Margera has struggled with substance abuse issues for years, and while sober now, has had a rocky relationship with the <em>Jackass</em> crew and is likely not returning in the next film. Dunn sadly died in 2011. His last <em>Jackass</em> movie was 2010’s <em>Jackass 3. </em>For <em>Jackass Forever, </em>the crew also added some younger talent to help out. No word if they will be returning this time around.</p>

 <p>The <em>Jackass</em> franchise is a big success for Paramount, with the four main films, and the <em>Bad Grandpa</em> spin-off, bringing in over $560 million worldwide at the box office on relatively tiny budgets. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">There was even a <em>Jackass</em> video game released in 2007. It was bad. Don’t play it.&nbsp;</a></p>
