It’s just insane...”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> reports</a></span> that Github has already removed the Playerscope mod from its repository for violating its terms of service, but there are worries the tool has already been backed up in other places for those willing to search it out. Threats of potential legal action also leave open the possibility of someone else making and sharing a similar mod that goes under the radar while still potentially endangering players’ privacy. </p><p>Yoshida did try to reassure fans that no personal data like payment information and home addresses are viewable using these tools, but it’s still unclear why team isn’t exploring an update to <em>FFXIV</em>’s account system as one possible solution to the larger stalking problem. “We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools,” the director wrote. “We also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
