              <p>We’ve heard of different colored models of the same exact car costing less than others, but Android tablets? That’s a new one on us. Nonetheless, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/">that’s what’s going on right now at Amazon with the Google Pixel Tablet, where you can save $150 on the white — sorry,&nbsp;<em>porcelain</em> — 128GB model</a> as opposed to the black model.</p>
<p>The white Google Pixel Tablet is just $249, 38% less than the exact same tablet in black. Why? No clue — under the hood they are identical: same 128GB capacity, same 11-inch screen size, same 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution, same Google AI capabilities. Same&nbsp;<em>everything</em>, <span>and once you put a cover on it, who could tell the difference even if they did care?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Don’t Overthink It</h2>
<p>There’s no reason to stare this gift horse in the mouth. Pocket the extra $150 and help yourself to one of the better Android tablets on the market. The 1st Gen Pixel Tablet is the best and most seamless way to utilize Google’s vast suite of apps in tablet form, including Gmail, Docs, and Photos — all optimized for the Pixel Tablet’s screen.</p>
<p>Not the least of these Google features that work brilliantly on the Pixel Tablet are Google AI and Gemini. Now when you’re using a tablet for creative endeavors, to craft an email, or to get a summary of your unread Gmail, Gemini can do that for you with amazing speed. Google AI can also search within photos, text, and videos just by circling it on the touchscreen.</p>



<h2>Great for Work and Play</h2>
<p>Another great creative use of the Pixel Tablet is for video calls with Google Meet. The HD video camera automatically follows you so you can stay in the center of the frame without having to sit in one place, and also adjusts the lighting to suit your surroundings. The people on the other end of your call come through bright and clear too on the 11-inch HD screen, which is also ideal for streaming video content via Google TV or Chromecast.</p>
<p>The 1st Gen Google Pixel Tablet is also the perfect device for managing your smart home devices, especially if they’re from the vast Google family. All told, the regular $399 price for the Pixel Tablet is certainly competitive, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/">but when Amazon suddenly decides that the white model is worth $150 less than that — just $249 during this limited-time deal</a> — it’s best to just agree with them and smash that Buy Now button before they change their mind.</p>

              <p>What the heck is going on with file sizes? With each passing year, we’ve seen them ballooning larger and larger to some real unreasonable levels. <em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> which released earlier this year comes in at over 120GB. No one will be shocked when <em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>doubles that. And while these game sizes keep going up, the Xbox Series X remains at a measly 1TB. So if you want to play more than just a small handful of titles without constantly deleting and redownloading your games, you’re going to need expansion storage.&nbsp; <strong>Seagate has an external drive specifically made for the Xbox Series X and Series S. </strong>Right now, it’s on sale for 19% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s usually priced at $160, so after the $30 savings, you only need to pay $130 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>You can double your Xbox Series X storage capacity with the help of this Seagate expansion drive, adding another 1TB of useable space</strong>. Now you’re working with two full terabytes, baby. It’s super easy to setup. Unlike the PlayStation 5 expansion cards, this one doesn’t require opening up the casing to get all up inside the inner bits. It’s simple plug and play. Just stick the Seagate drive into the slot on the backend of your Xbox and you’ll be able to start downloading games right to it or moving them from your internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Seagate developed this external drive in partnership with Xbox and Microsoft, officially licensing the Xbox Velocity Architecture. That technology is used in Xbox Series X allows players to utilize Quick Resume, a feature enabling Xbox games to be running simultaneously.</p>
<p>On the Xbox Series X, you can hop between different games on the fly. So if you’re mid-race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, you can pause to go drop in with your pals for a quick Fortnite session. then continue the race when you’re done. You’ll never see a title screen again.</p>



<p>So because this architecture has been licensed from Microsoft, you can take advantage of Quick Resume and all the other benefits of Xbox’s enhanced memory and storage when playing games off of the Seagate expansion card. You’ll find no changes in performance when playing games off the expansion card versus off the Xbox’s internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Seagate expansion drive for Xbox, increasing your storage by 1TB for a discounted rate</a>. It’s down from $160 to just $130.</p>

              <p>Some <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> players like to say that the MMORPG has a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward mods. While technically verboten under the strict terms of the game’s user agreement, Square Enix has mostly been content to look the other way as long as the mods aren’t interfering with the overall health and integrity of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228">But last week</a>, a plugin for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> called Mare Synchronos was taken down by its creator after receiving a letter from Square Enix’s lawyers. The crackdown came as a surprise to some, while others felt like players had left Square Enix with no choice but to take action. And reading between the lines of a new blog post from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida, that’s essentially what happened.</p>
