Granted, you won’t be able to see your character very often if you play the game entirely in first-person, but you’ll be able to admire them in all their glory if you switch to third-person. And if you opt for that camera mode, you’d probably also like for their gear to look, you know, cool.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195840" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="284" data-playlist="195840,196789,195624" data-current="195840"><div><p>Take A Tour Through Halo Infinite's Newest Arena Maps</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195840/195840_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21353.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Thankfully, <em>Avowed</em> allows you to transmogrify (“transmog” for short) your gear, meaning you can take the look of one piece of armor and apply it to another. This lets you upgrade to gear with better stats while maintaining a fashionable appearance, or a preferred look. Here’s how you can transmog your gear in <em>Avowed</em>.</p><h2 id="h141985"><a id=""></a><strong>How to transmogrify your gear in <em>Avowed</em></strong></h2><p>If you want to transmog your armor in <em>Avowed</em>, make sure you’ve equipped the gear with the stats you want for your character, then open your inventory and navigate to whichever piece of gear you want to make your equipped piece appear as. <strong>Left click (or press RT on a controller) this piece of gear to complete the transmog</strong>.</p><p>An important note, however, is to remember that you must actively own the gear that you’d like to use the appearance of. If you sell it or break it down, you won’t be able to use that look on your other armor sets. So be sure to hang on to any particularly rad pieces of armor you come across, so you can continue proving that you have killer fashion sense. Don’t let anyone tell you that you don’t look <em>damn</em> snazzy.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox and PC. And before you ask, no, you can’t transmog one of those into a copy for PlayStation 5. But there are (currently unconfirmed) rumors that the game will also make its way to Sony’s console eventually.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But since then, it’s won over a devoted fan following, including the YouTuber videogamedunkey, who liked it so much he decided to help republish it eight years later <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/videogamedunkey-youtube-review-bigmode-hades-cuphead-1849567984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/videogamedunkey-youtube-review-bigmode-hades-cuphead-1849567984">under the Bigmode label</a></span>.

Team D-13's top-down sci-fi shoot ‘em up originally debuted on Steam as “Monolith.” The re-branding seems to be partly about giving the indie gem a catchier name, and also partly about avoiding potential legal trouble with Warner Bros. Games, who has the original title trademarked for its studio of the same name.</p><p>But for many, <em>Star of Providence </em>will essentially be their first introduction to the roguelike’s striking retro art style and vast array of enemies, weapons, and secrets. The boss fights are especially cool-looking and the chiptune-esque  soundtrack kicks ass. </p><p>The Switch release marks a sort of 1.5 launch for the game, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/603960/view/501691675000701060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/603960/view/501691675000701060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Into Oblivion</a></span> being its biggest content update in five years, following 2020's Relics of the Past. Here’s all the new content the game got this week:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>2 new upgrades.</li><li>1 new playable character.</li><li>5 new normal enemies.</li><li>More new bosses than enemies for some reason.</li><li>13 new unique weapons.</li><li>20 new cartridges.</li><li>43 new keywords (including those exclusive to Skully and Unique weapons).</li><li>A nearly complete rework of the loop mechanic, including capping it to a maximum loop of 13.</li><li>A nearly complete rework of the Skully playable “ship”.</li><li>Face the Gauntlet, a new sub-branch which appears on late-game floors and offers valuable rewards in exchange for defeating esoteric challenges.</li><li>“Boss” “Rushes”.</li><li>Hundreds of new room layouts, featuring a variety of new hazards and gimmicks.</li><li>Massive balance changes, visual improvements, and performance optimizations across the whole game.</li><li>The unknown diminishes, ever so slightly.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Games rarely get second chances, especially beloved small indie releases that got lost in the shuffle, so it’s neat to see <em>Star of Providence</em> getting another shot at the limelight. While many overlooked it back in 2017, it did end up making videogamedunkey’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UhFWoDZLxA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UhFWoDZLxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best games of 2018</a></span> list at number 14. </p><p>He praised its deceptively simple design, and willingness to throw players into the deep end of the space horror pond and let them figure it out through hours of dying and restarting. Once mastered, however, the game can be finished in as little as 35 minutes. Perfect for Switch.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
