In eight award-worthy episodes of <em>The Penguin, </em>Cobb has dismantled the Maroni crime family, inspired mutinies in all of the rival gangs, and is figuratively and literally on top of Gotham. Although Gotham produces a new villain every day, for now, Oz is the king. And he’s already shown how he can influence the media and politics, making him even more formidable.</p><p>The biggest confirmation of Oz being Batman’s next nemesis is in the last scene of <em>The Penguin </em>when Eve Karlo (Carmen Ejogo), creepily cosplaying as Cobb’s mother, tells him there’s nothing in his way of Gotham being his, just before someone gets the bright idea to send the bat signal into the sky.

While Batman was solving riddles and doing the most brooding version of flirting with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Sofia Gigante was being drugged, electrocuted, and assaulted in Arkham Asylum thanks to Cobb. Now that she’s back in Arkham Asylum because of the same person, Batman may have gained an ally he doesn’t know he has yet.</p><p>In the comics, Gigante is secretly the serial killer The Hangman, an identity she denies is hers in the show, and runs into issues with Batman. Even if she isn’t The Hangman in <em>The Penguin</em>, she’s shown she’s a ruthless tactician willing to bomb an already decimated community like Crown Point if it means blowing up Cobb’s operation in the process. It would be safe to assume the only joy Gigante feels is the recurring thought of how she will enact revenge on Penguin. Why not let your half-sister’s love interest help do the job for you?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Corruption in Gotham is like sand in the desert. In episode six of <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb spoke about politicians diverting resources like electricity and infrastructure repair to richer communities instead of to the poorer communities like Crown Point that are living in rubble and FEMA tents. In<em> Batman </em>lore, this type of nefarious prejudice is usually the work of one shadowy cabal, The Court of Owls. </p><p>This is a secret society comprised of the wealthiest and most influential people who control every part of Gotham, yet only exist to most of the citizens as an urban legend. The classist divide in the city was a main motivator for The Riddler, who grew up as a poor orphan, targeting corrupt wealthy individuals who he felt abandoned those with similar upbringings. That insidious elitism, along with Gotham’s criminal hierarchy being in flux thanks to Cobb and Gigante’s turf war, might be enough for the true rulers of Gotham to come out of the shadows in <em>The Batman Part II</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In two episodes, the Maroni crime family succession tree was dismantled after Cobb set fire to matriarch Nadia Maroni (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and heir to the throne Taj Maroni (Aria Shahghasemi), before fighting head of the family Salvatore Maroni (Clancy Brown) to the point of a heart attack. </p><p>The Maroni family is no joke and played a pivotal role in <em>The Batman</em>, as Salvatore tried blackmailing Batman’s father Thomas Wayne while he was running for mayor by threatening to release information about his wife Martha Wayne’s struggles with mental illness. This led to a domino effect where Thomas inadvertently got the journalist killed by Carmine Falcone after asking the crime boss to only threaten them into silence, and then got himself killed when he tried to turn Falcone in. In a not-so-roundabout way, the Maroni family is responsible for Batman losing his parents. </p><p>Now, that the heads of the family are gone, is there a long lost familial successor looking to take on the mantle and, as a result, the ire of Batman?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the biggest missteps the movie made that was fixed in the show was the relatively little time fans got to spend in the playground of nightmares that is Arkham Asylum.

Given the fact she’s back in her old, deranged stomping grounds, and the best <em>Batman</em> villains are in Arkham, <em>The Batman Part II </em>would be foolish to treat it like a side quest after <em>The Penguin</em> made us want to live in that world for longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gotham is fun, but it’s just one city. Both the movie and the show keep all of the action inside the murderous metropolis. But, in <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb mentioned a few times how partnering with the Chinese crime syndicate The Triads could take his operation international. Now that they not only agreed to join his alliance with the other rival gangs of Gotham, but also had internal mutinies that helped Cobb ascend to the top of Gotham’s crime world, it looks like it’s only a matter of time before we see the true scope of Gotham’s influence beyond the city limits. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros/Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Carmine Falcone spread his seed far and wide, and somehow produced two of the most badass women to ever hit Gotham. Kyle may have despondently left the city after deeming it beyond saving at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, but we all know the woman who eventually becomes Catwoman always crawls back to the city that made her. And her letter to her imprisoned half-sister at the end of <em>The Penguin</em>’s season finale is her first step back home.</p><p>Kyle’s letter not only woke Gigante out of her catatonic gaze, but brought a smile to her face. This is arguably the most compelling wrinkle that <em>The Penguin </em>adds to <em>The Batman Part II</em>’s storyline. What could she have possibly written that would make a woman, who could be facing death in prison, feel joy? Did she congratulate her on wiping out multiple crime families, including the one they were both born to and victimized by? Did she let her know that she thinks she’s innocent (she isn’t) and she was framed (she wasn’t)? Or, maybe she told her a plan she has to get her sister out so they can enact her revenge alongside her lover boy Batman?</p><p>Whatever she wrote, <em>The Batman Part II </em>needs to find a way to make that a catalyst for the sisterly meet-up we all want. Plus, I’m sure if you have undeniable talent like Kravitz and Milioti in your cinematic universe, you’re legally obligated to make them share the screen. Or, you should be. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Batman</em> director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Reeves told us</a></span> from the start that Batman wouldn’t been swooping in to save the day in <em>The Penguin </em>because the show was meant to focus solely on telling the story of Gotham’s underworld, not how Batman fights their crimes. That’s all well and good, but we’re going to need to know what this man was doing while another bomb was set off in Crown Point and the entire Falcone family’s murder was plastered all over the news only weeks after he couldn’t stop The Riddler from blowing up the sea wall and flooding the city. How much prep time does this man need?! </p><p>It’s going to ultimately be amazing when Batman returns into this expanded underworld in <em>The Batman Part II, </em>but it would really insult our intelligence if there aren’t parts of the movie where Batman at least acknowledges he was aware of the events that transpired in <em>The Penguin </em>and let’s us in on what the world’s greatest detective was doing with his time. It wouldn’t just satiate fans, it would further solidify <em>The Batman</em> universe being built in front of our eyes.</p><p>Now that the bat signal has been shined in the sky, it’s time to go to work. We, and our questions, will be waiting.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This look at the back end, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a></span> by <em>Pokémon</em> community account CentroLeaks, outlines a suspected upcoming schedule of the card game from new events to new booster packs, with the card set after Genetic Apex <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly arriving around January 29</a></span>.</p><p>That deduction was based on the apparent naming convention in the code which tags current in-game events as part of A1, while after January they move to A2. But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that. In the meantime, November appears to have a part 2 to the current Meowth event waiting in the wings, as well as a potential Black Friday event and something called “Mass Outbreak.” </p><p>If you ask me, the updates can’t come soon enough.

Fortunately, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> still excels at the thing I need it for most: 5 minutes of peace staring at beautiful <em>Pokémon </em>cards while I drink my morning coffee. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She’s an adult woman, it’s no big deal. But it’s <em>maybe</em> more of an issue when she starts leaving tabs open all over the merch sold to kids. This is what’s happened on the boxes for two <em>Wicked </em>movie tie-in Barbie dolls.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s all thanks to a good-old-fashioned mix-up. Two new Barbie dolls have been released, to coincide with the imminent release of the movie version of hit musical <em>Wicked</em>, based on the characters of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, and Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West (Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo). Each is released in the traditional cardboard box, and as ever, it’s covered in all sorts of tiny writing almost no one ever reads. However, those who did read the fine print on the new dolls got quite a shock when they followed the URL listed for the products.</p><p>It’s easy to see how the mistake was made. The address on the boxes is “www.wicked.com,” which makes sense, right? Except, that takes you to porn site Wicked, owned by Dutch company Digigamma, a company that says it “specializes in running and managing high risk e-commerce businesses.”</p><p>Presumably the intention had been to point people toward Universal’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.wickedmovie.com</a></span>, but someone at Mattel assumed the production company had done a better job of scooping up URLs.</p><p>The Wicked porn site must have already been doing a roaring trade in mistaken traffic, long before the Barbie goof. The musical has been an astonishing hit since 2003, sitting on Broadway and touring worldwide ever since. The movie itself will have added to that, with early word suggesting it’s going to be <em>very</em> good. But Barbie has pushed it into the mainstream, with news sites jumping on the error.<br></p><p>Mattel told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> that it “deeply regrets” the incident, and the doll was removed from sale in stores like Target, Walmart and Kohl’s by the end of Sunday, the 10th. They’re also gone from Amazon, although <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mattel-Accessories-Movie-Inspired-Removable-HYM40/dp/B0CMGXW1CV&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mattel-Accessories-Movie-Inspired-Removable-HYM40/dp/B0CMGXW1CV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the UK version of the retailer</a></span> still has listings, albeit with no option to buy.</p><p>Those boxed dolls are going to be worth <em>a fortune</em>.
