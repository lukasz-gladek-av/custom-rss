              <p>Wolverine is going to kill a lot of people. That was the main takeaway from the first gameplay trailer for the upcoming PS5 exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-wolverines-turn-for-a-big-budget-video-game-1847646598"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>,</a> which was shown off during Wednesday’s State of Play. Who’s ready for some true, next-gen blood tech?</p> <p>Alongside its first big trailer, Insomniac Games confirmed that <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> will be Sony’s big fall 2026 blockbuster. For anyone who worries Logan might be taking it easy in a more family-friendly superhero blockbuster, fear not: the <em>X-Men</em> icon appears to have no qualms about slitting throats and slashing vital arteries in his first solo video-game outing in years.</p> <p>Take a look for yourself:</p>  <p>Wolverine will be played by actor Liam McIntyre, who portrays a version of the comic book character trying to uncover his past. Apparently there are a bunch of weird cyborg enemies who don’t want that to happen. “He’ll leave an impression on his foes with fast, fluid, and rapid attacks and techniques that’ll dismember or break anyone who gets in his way,” writes Insomniac’s Aaron Jason Espinoza <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-arrives-on-playstation-5-fall-2026/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. “Wolverine might be distant, but he isn’t afraid to get up-close and personal when it counts.”</p>

 <p>This journey will take Logan around the world, from the Canadian wilderness to the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Along the way he’ll come face to face with Omega Red, Mystique, and others, including one of the game’s enemy factions called the Reavers. Espinoza says the development team is looking to marry the violent gameplay with a nuanced story, and is also trying to break new ground with a game that’s “much darker and more brutal than you might expect from Insomniac.”</p> <p>That’s great news, even if some of the shots in the trailer gave me the familiar queasiness of a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> fatality. Can <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> be more than&nbsp;<em>just</em> a hyper-violent showcase of next-gen cinematic storytelling? I hope so. Insomniac says fans can expect to see more of the game in the spring.</p>
