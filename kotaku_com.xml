So if, in the midst of all that, you didn’t happen to catch the video game reference in the show, you can be forgiven for missing it. That’s right, Lamar put a direct reference to PlayStation in his performance.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wired</em></a></span> has a deep dive into the making of Lamar’s show, including interviews with the performance’s art director Shelley Rodgers and creative director Mike Carson, who explained that the premise of the show’s staging was to portray Lamar’s life “as a video game.” This included spaces on stage that were made to look like the face buttons of a PlayStation controller; a triangle, circle, X, and square. </p><p>“I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people,” Rodgers told <em>Wired</em>. “A lot of it is showing his journey, traveling through the American dream.”</p><p>The performance itself wasn’t too overt with the video game motif, with Carson saying the team wanted to stay “clean and minimal.”</p><p>“We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music,” Carson said.</p><p><em>Wired’</em>s story has a lot more behind-the-scenes information, including some photos of the stage being built. After noticing the PlayStation buttons in the set, some fans are saying the video game motif adds another layer to the ongoing feud between Lamar and Drake, essentially making this a “game over” moment for the Canadian rapper.</p><p>The whole show felt like a victory lap for the incredible year Kendrick’s had. Between winning the Drake feud by a landslide, releasing an excellent album in <em>GNX</em>, and co-headlining an upcoming tour with R&amp;B goddess SZA, the guy can’t stop winning.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’ll stretch his arms out to hit enemies in close and medium range and it will be your go-to for dealing “filler” damage when Spore Bomb is on cooldown.</p><p><strong>Strangling Prison:</strong> This Ultimate grabs nearby enemies and pulls them together to wherever you aim the ability, dealing steady damage for a while. It’s a great opportunity to group enemies up so they can be taken out by Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, and many other Ultimate abilities.</p><p><strong>Thornlash Wall:</strong> This ability places a small wall at the target location. You have several charges of this one, so multiple walls can be placed. It can be angled several different ways and will Awaken when Groot is nearby, causing it to attack nearby enemies. Use it to block off locations and, ideally, separate healers from the rest of their team. Divide and conquer, baby. If a Duelist gets too greedy and runs ahead of the pack, place a wall behind them to make them easy to knockout.</p><p><strong>Ironwood Wall:</strong> This ability places a larger Ironwood Wall at the target location. You can only place one of these at a time, so think strategically. It can also be angled, and when Groot is nearby, the Ironwood wall will awaken to grant Groot and his nearby allies bonus health based on the damage they deal. While the Thornlash Wall is good to keep nearby, you definitely want to keep Ironwood near points you are guarding.</p><p><strong>Furious Flora:</strong> This is Groot’s melee attack. Hold this down and Groot will perform a three-hit melee combo. The last hit launches into the air, but there isn’t really a reason to use this instead of Vine Strike.</p><p><strong>Spore Bomb:</strong> - This is a grenade-like projectile that explodes, dealing AOE (area-of-effect) damage. Three smaller explosives spread out and detonate again, making this a great tool to throw into groups of enemies. With a short, 6-second cooldown, you should use this basically every time it’s available.</p><p><strong>Flora Colossus (Passive):</strong> This passive awakens spawned walls near Groot, activating their secondary abilities.</p><p><strong>Friendly Shoulder (Team-Up Ability: Passive):</strong> If Jeff the Land Shark or Rocket Raccoon are on your team, they can ride on Groot’s shoulders, taking less damage than they otherwise would. It’s also incredibly cute, which is a bonus all by itself.</p><h2 id="h686368"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Groot?</h2><p>Groot is one of the best Tanks in the game if played correctly. He can solo Tank with steady healers and has lots of versatility due to his ability to create walls. The most potent part of his kit, and the one which takes the most practice, is creating line-of-sight obstructions to cause problems for healers on the opposing team. </p><figure id="" data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use walls to defend key points, forcing enemies to waste time attacking your wooden constructs to make it through narrow hallways.

Groot has a high skill ceiling, so there is lots of room to grow.</p><hr><p>Take these tips to heart and grow strong, like the mighty oak.

It definitely happened. However, it was still a fairly rare occurrence and most big-name actors were careful about appearing in too many. For example, Tommy Lee Jones and other Hollywood stars would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly over to Japan and other countries to do commercials</a></span> so nobody over here in the States would see them. There was still a fear that if you sold out <em>too </em>much and <em>too </em>often you’d look desperate and signal that your career was ending. And this was the case for decades. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a></span> and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a></span> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!”</p><p>That has led us to 2025 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a></span> including famous people to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad. Watching Harrison Ford, an actor whom I really like and who has turned in some incredible performances, try to connect being a hero to owning a Jeep made me want to throw my TV out the window. Being assaulted with 20 different variations on “Actors and celebs behaving wacky while holding branded products” made me want to throw my phone out the window. </p><p>I think what really drives me nuts about these ads is how transparently greedy it all is. A lot of the people appearing in these commercials don’t need the money and yet, they likely got paid quite a bit to appear. And they just don’t care anymore about even pretending to look like artists or creators with backbones and morals.</p><p> They know that most people don’t care anymore. Everything we watch appears on the same tiny phone screen. The delineation between movies and TV and random viral videos is gone. It’s been gone for awhile. And that means there isn’t anything stopping someone like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Keoghan appearing in an ad for Square Space</a></span>. It won’t ruin his career or cost him fans or make him less of an artist anymore. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actors can freely dig up past roles and characters</a></span>, skin them, and prance about for 30 seconds recreating some moment you might remember, and get paid a lot to do it while suffering no negative consequences.</p><p>You might wonder “Who does this hurt?” or “What’s the harm of celebs getting paid to do commercials?” And to be clear, none of this is really hurting anybody. There are certainly bigger problems in the world right now. But that doesn’t change that it sucks shit—it hurts <em>art</em>. Hawking products for cash makes you a salesperson, not an artist.</p><p>So my suggestion is simple: Let’s start making fun of celebs for selling out and reminding them that its gross. It’s going to take a few years to build up momentum and change anything, but if we pull this off and we go back to making actors and artists feel shame again, we all might be able to avoid shit like Seal appearing as a seal in a fucking soda ad. </p><p>Doesn’t that sounds like a future you want to live in? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
