            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One year ago this week, Sony launched one of its most expensive video game consoles ever: <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-unboxing-inside-review-comparison-1851688605">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The company promised improved performance and visuals over the standard PS5 as well as DLSS-like upscaling. And while some games definitely benefit from the power, I’ve mostly forgotten I even own a PS5 Pro.</p>

 <p>When Sony announced the PlayStation 5 Pro last year, it received a mixed reception. While some were excited to have a more powerful console that could run games at higher framerates, many weren’t convinced it was necessary.<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442"> And then Sony showed everyone the $700 price tag</a>, and it became even harder to justify the new console. But despite all that, I was still excited to get a PS5 Pro. I have a big ol’ 4K TV and I care about framerates and all the minutiae that impacts how a game looks. And over the last year, I’ve enjoyed some great games on my PS5 Pro. <em>Battlefield 6,</em> for example, looks and runs wonderfully on Sony’s beefier machine. Likewise, <em>Death Stranding 2</em> looks incredibly sharp on PS5 Pro while still running flawlessly.</p>

 <p>Yet, many other games I play on my PS5 Pro either don’t look or feel noticeably better, or feature no improvements at all. It doesn’t help that the PlayStation Store still lacks detailed information about what PS5 Pro enhancements are included in a given game. Sometimes I have to go digging around online to find a blog or Reddit post to determine what, if anything, has changed because I’m playing a game on PS5 Pro. That’s not a great experience for a console that now <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">costs $750.</a></p>

 <p>I can confirm that after a year of use, the PS5 Pro hasn’t given me any troubles. It runs quietly, still feels snappy to use, and hasn’t broken in some other way. In comparison, my base PS5’s USB-C port stopped working after just a few weeks. So at the very least, the PS5 Pro seems well-built and sturdy, which is nice, I guess. But is all of that worth $750?</p>

 <h2>Should you buy a PS5 Pro in 2025?</h2> <p>After using the PS5 Pro for a year, I find it hard to recommend. While I do think there are some people out there who will get some benefit from owning a PS5 Pro–<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">mainly folks with 4KTVs who really care about performance</a>–most people don’t need Sony’s more powerful console. Heck, I’m a bit of a graphics snob who loves running games at 120FPS, and I often forget the PS5 Pro is sitting in front of me because games so rarely feel like they’re benefiting from its enhanced specs.</p>

 <p>The lack of third-party support is disappointing, too. It’s surprising how many games are still launching on the PS5 via the PlayStation Store without any PS5 Pro benefits. You’d think at this point, Sony would be pushing devs and publishers to support the pricey console more. But it doesn’t feel like that is the case, which I find very strange, and that makes it even harder to recommend plopping down the cash for this thing.</p> <p>At this point, I’d suggest sticking to your PS5 (if you have one) and just enjoying it for a few more years and buying a PlayStation 6 instead when that console finally launches in the next few years, likely at a similar price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-hidden-bunker-data-download-trials-2000642994</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-hidden-bunker-mystery-might-not-be-so-mysterious.1350148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First, I’m telling you to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966">stop exploiting the ledge grab</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and now I’m telling you to stop obsessing over something that probably isn’t worth your attention. Sorry to be “mom” here, but I’m pretty sure the Hidden Bunker mystery in Spaceport isn’t really a mystery at all.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Ledge Grab Exploit Is Bad, Actually</a></p> <p>Each map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see various timed events come and go. Some just see the map swapped over to a night theme, while others have dangerous electrical storms. Most recently, a mysterious hidden bunker underneath the Spaceport map was thrown into the rotation. It works like this: After an activation sequence on the surface, players can explore the corridors beneath the map to find some decent loot as well as some computer terminals to download data from. You get 500XP for downloading the data, and earn progress on your weekly Trials, but not much else happens. Fans, however, are not convinced that’s all there is to it (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/arc-raiders-new-hidden-bunker-puzzle-has-players-completely-stumped-3281779/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>).</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/yhQIigWZcZ4">documented by YouTuber The Gaming Merchant</a>, downloading the data in the Hidden Bunker <i>feels</i> like it should make something happen somewhere else or deeper in the Bunker, or like it’s part of a larger puzzle. You press a button, a meter fills up, a light turns green and you get XP, but if you walk away without doing this, the light turns red. There are multiple computer terminals that do this within the Bunker, which has led some to believe that they all either need to be activated at the exact same time or in some unknown sequence. There are more terminals than players the game allows for in a single party, so you’d have to gather together a bunch of randos to fully exhaust the options here, but I’m pretty sure that earning XP and making progress on your Trials is the whole point here: Activate the terminals and defend the room until they’re finished downloading.</p>

 <p>Downloading the data is not as easy as just flipping a switch and walking away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2oTiy1D6l6Q">Gamers Heroes’ video on the Hidden Bunker</a> documents this well. There’s a bit of <i>Siege</i>-esque Defend-The-Room™ required as the Hidden Bunker is likely to be swarming with players looking for other loot.</p>

  <p>Do this successfully, and you earn three stars in your Trials progress.</p> <h2>Is there a secret beneath the Spaceport?</h2> <p>Some folks are not convinced the XP and Trials progress is the point here. They’re running around trying to crack sequences they think exist, or they’re trying to activate them all at the same time, but to no avail.</p>

 <p>Honestly, I think too many folks still have their spinfoil hats on from <i>Destiny</i>.</p> <p>A megathread on the game’s subreddit is presently documenting some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no81af1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">borderline Charlie-Day-meme</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no379fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">theory crafting</a> about what’s going on here.</p>

   <p>The biggest piece of evidence, in my opinion, that there’s no <i>there there</i> is in a lone comment indicating that the download progress of each computer is different for each player, which would mean it’s a different instance for players outside of your squad and that timing the downloads is nigh impossible because, well, they’re not designed that way. You get your data, you get your XP, you get your Trials progress. That’s it!</p>

When you download the data, a light on the computer turns green. That light, as it turns out, is the same model as found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">Field Depots</a>, of which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2j64j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">there is one sitting right on top of the Hidden Bunker’s location</a>. Another theory concerns the language found on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ official website describing the event, particularly that “whatever is inside [the Bunker] must be worth the static.” This has folks obsessing over what “static” means.</p> <p>Comments in the megathread indicate that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2hhan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a variety of attempted solutions</a>, such as downloading everything at the same time, or downloading the data and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no66rp9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">racing to a suspicious location on the map</a>, offer no alternative outcomes. Also, while exploring the Hidden Bunker, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no299el/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">someone managed to fall through the map</a> and, based on their screenshots, there doesn’t appear to be any secret sublayer below. So, various activation methods don’t trigger anything and there don’t appear to be any unlockable portions of the Hidden Bunker.</p> <p>But curious minds aren’t so easily dismayed. Even the fact that the data downloads are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no57p16/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">required for this week’s Trials</a> has folks suspicious: “I feel like this could either mean that collecting the data for that 500 XP is its own reward,” one reply says, “or this is to incentivize people to run it more and more until someone figures it out.”</p> <p>I think ya had the answer right the first time there.</p> <p>But maybe I’m just a wet blanket of a skeptic as always. I’d like to believe!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-opens-the-loot-box-flood-gates-in-its-race-with-roblox.1350145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Epic Games ended controversial loot box purchases in<em> Fortnite</em> back in 2019, but it’s bringing them back <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">to the battle royale platform</a> as an option for creators in the form of “paid random items.” While there are rules in place about disclosing odds and not targeting minors, loot boxes are essentially back on the menu for the larger <em>Fortnite</em> creator island platform as Epic tries to compete with <em>Roblox</em> for players’ attention and wallets.</p>

 <p>A new developer blog post details Epic’s rules for “<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite">In-Island Transactions Restrictions</a>” that will be available in creator islands in the future, including transactions fueled by RNG. “In addition to your responsibility to comply with laws, you must comply with certain restrictions that apply when offering Paid Random Items,” the company, which makes billions a year from microtransactions, writes. “Failure to utilize the functions described below will constitute a violation of Epic policies. ”</p>

 <p>The policies governing how creators can deploy loot boxes in their games are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Paid Random Items are restricted in Singapore, Qatar, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK/Brazil for players under 18 years old.</li> <li>Developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.”</li> <li>They must “ensure the language you use relating to transactions is not misleading or overtly pressuring.”</li> <li>They can’t “directly prompt a minor” to buy something.</li> <li>Bundled items in Brazil must be available to purchase individually.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s it. Outside of those restrictions, or any other legal requirements unique to individual countries, <em>Fortnite</em> creators have free rein to design and sell loot boxes however they want. With no shortage of imagination, I’m sure some of them could design very clever and very lucrative systems for both entertaining players and extracting lots of V-Bucks from their virtual wallets.</p>

 <h2>Epic promises it’s not promoting gambling</h2> <p>But Epic Games is adamant that none of this will amount to gambling and that random paid items themselves do not count as such. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that the company reached out to the outlet to ask it to remove references to gambling in a recent article covering leaked info about the update, noting that gambling is against <em>Fortnite</em>‘s rules.</p>

 <p>“Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency,” read Epic’s <a href="https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/fortnite/developer-rules">developer terms of service</a>. “Islands that teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>

 <p>Epic and other companies have been making this argument about loot boxes <a href="https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091">for years</a>, claiming that if odds are disclosed and the items can’t be easily resold for actual money, then they don’t count as gambling, even though they otherwise perfectly mirror the experience of a lottery scratch-off. No matter how you define gambling, though, it’s clear loot boxes are <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">designed to exploit people’s psychology</a> to get them to spend money they wouldn’t otherwise part with.</p>

 <h2>The race to keep up with <em>Roblox</em></h2> <p>Why is Epic Games tip-toeing back into a pond that was once so controversial it <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">led to Congressional hearings and legislative proposals</a>? The most obvious reason is that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/arts/grow-garden-roblox-record.htm">currently competing with Roblox</a> to operate the platform of choice for user-generated games and the millions of people who play them. It paid out over $350 million <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">to its island creators last year</a>, and announced <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">plans in September</a> to let them start selling in-game items just like regular <em>Fortnite </em>does.</p>

 <p>Roblox, of course, was already doing this. <em>Grow a Garden</em>, one of its biggest surprise hits with concurrent players peaking at over 22 million, is essentially a farming sim with a daily shop that refreshes and where you can spend Robux on microtransactions to acquire rare seeds or make harvesting more efficient. The game isn’t popular in spite of the pay-to-win mechanics underlying it, but in part because of them. The success of gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and card pack modes like <em>EA Sports FC</em>‘s Ultimate Team shows this isn’t isolated to UGC games either.</p> <p>Epic is currently trying to beat Roblox with a more generous cut of the profits. <em>Fortnite</em> creators can earn 74 percent of in-game sales through the end of the 2026, after which it will drop down to 37 percent. That’s still substantially more than the cut creators are currently getting at Roblox, which only pays out 25 percent of in-game sales. I’m sure none of this will create perverse incentives for what <em>Fortnite</em> creators make moving forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It is exhausting seeing how many aspects of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>experience people try to exploit as part of some money-making scheme. The cards are obviously the most prominent example of this, as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers and the content creation mill</span></a><span> have turned the act of buying and selling packs into a lucrative business at the expense of players being able to derive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>any joy from the hobby</span></a><span>. But people selling </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-related stuff</span> <span>for a profit isn’t limited to physical goods. Nowadays, you can find someone asking for real-world cash for a Shiny Pokémon in games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>how much easier </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes it</span></a><span> to find the rare, alternate-colored ‘mons in Lumiose City, some folks would rather just fork over some of their hard-earned money to save themselves a few hours of grinding to make one of them spawn. At least, that’s what some sellers on places like eBay are banking on. If you search for Shiny Pokémon on the site, you’ll find dozens of listings, some selling specific creatures and others letting people specify the Shiny they’re seeking. One of the most expensive offerings includes a </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/167871843921?_skw=pokemon+legends+z-a+shiny&amp;itmmeta=01K9SS6250KZXESVT648WYM062&amp;hash=item2715f10e51:g:qrYAAeSwNkRo-Pgk&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cmZMWT%2BJmOrrmcpCm9OPCOq%2F6C5X%2FOvRyhCN6Xbr3piM4Xf0yos%2Bgp99jZhgqUClMlqLGYsp%2Fijcj6Fn92F5x8KzHOf%2BYl6iTUbSbF67RqNNpK2soagMaN3RJ3fd%2BLuzrXiris2fOv5f9FwaYiG4IUgsCYY35bTh354GI2XLjyRcZnn%2BC6VAfT1oLyhUq%2Bt2gyS9DOMuwqTv8AVsDe8gKXlah20yBDsXzsouFU%2FpRLVXX4XcR7e7D%2FrHAT4dZZFEfjtuW1nAo3YDWCSnNJj59y%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9SimLnOZg"><span>full “Living Dex” of every Shiny Pokémon in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> for $300</span></a><span>. There’s also a cheaper (but still very expensive) </span><a href="https://ebay.us/m/kYPhJ1"><span>$80 listing for every Shiny Mega Evolution Pokémon</span></a><span> in the game thus far. That’s more than it costs to buy the game itself.</span></p> <p><span>I understand that for a lot of people, the joy of shinies is not in the exhausting hunt and they just want to put these rare creatures in their party or in a box so they can say they have them. But man, I can’t imagine being that devoted to Shiny Pokémon that you’d be willing to fork over real-world money for one, especially when they aren’t limited-time offerings. I wasn’t surprised when scalpers were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-koraidon-miraidon-gamestop-codes-scalper-2000629926"><span>selling free Shiny Miraidon and Koraidon codes</span></a><span> because GameStop had made that an issue of false scarcity. But people are often willing to spend money to save themselves time. So I guess this isn’t that different from spending money on microtransactions to skip through a waiting period in an app. But at least with those, you don’t have to haggle and negotiate on something that was never meant to have a real-world monetary value. Go with Arceus, friends. Make responsible decisions.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>10 years ago this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-fallout-4-switch-2-2026-anniversary-edition-trailer-xbox-ps5-2000638638"><em>Fallout 4</em></a> launched across console and PC. It’s a big milestone for the open-world RPG. And Bethesda has decided to celebrate it by pushing out a new update that seemingly breaks the game for a lot of people and releasing some overpriced and confusing DLC. Yay?</p>

 <p>First announced in October, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/377160/announcements/detail/814714767715337534">the <em>Fallout 4</em> Anniversary Update</a> is now live across all platforms. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-anniversary-bethesda-update-mods-creation-2000641340">This update fixes an old issue in VATS</a>, makes a few other tweaks, and, more importantly, adds Creations to<em> Fallout 4</em>. This is Bethesda’s cross-platform mod solution that is already present in <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Starfield</em>. It lets people create content for<em> Fallout 4</em> that can then be downloaded on consoles and PC. Some of this content costs money, but a lot of it is free. It’s a fine system, but when the<em> Fallout 4</em> update launched on Monday, it was completely broken.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ou1p8a/thanks_todd_i_really_hate_you_now/">Over on Reddit,</a> players began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otjmcr/already_off_to_a_great_start/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sharing screenshots of the Creations menu in <em>Fallout 4</em> failing to load anything</a> or just spitting out error messages. This is a problem for content that costs money, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otx4yt/8_pipboy_skin_no_preview_image/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">like an $8 Pipboy skin</a> that had a broken preview window, making it impossible to actually see what it looked like before buying. Not great! Thankfully, Bethesda seems to be aware of the issues with the Creations menu and has reportedly fixed things, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1otkr3p/official_discord_statement_on_dropped_ball_for/">according to an official comment from the publisher on Discord</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1oubg15/all_my_dlcs_got_deleted_and_the_option_to_install/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">However,</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1otn1cw/fallout_4_anniversary_update_breaks_game_and_adds/">the update itself is still causing lots of players headaches</a>. People are reporting that<em> Fallout 4</em> save games are being destroyed. Others are reporting that after the update, they can’t play because <em>Fallout 4</em> requires the installation of previously purchased DLC, even though it’s already installed. My brother had this happen to him when booting up<em> Fallout 4</em> on Steam and gave up trying to play. Others are dealing with new bugs, glitchy menus, and more. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ou1p8a/thanks_todd_i_really_hate_you_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">And these problems exist on both PC and console.</a></p>

 <h2><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s new DLC is being trashed by Steam users</h2> <p>Beyond the bugs, the<em> Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</em> is also causing some confusion. There are now three versions of <em>Fallout 4</em> that you can buy: The base original game, a<em> Game of the Year Edition</em>, and now the<em>&nbsp;Anniversary Edition.</em> But, despite the name of that last edition, you don’t need to buy it to access the new Anniversary update, which is free to all <em>Fallout 4</em> players. And confusingly, there’s an Anniversary Edition upgrade for people who already own <em>Fallout 4 a</em>nd its DLC. But you can also just buy the newly released <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1oti07g/fyi_for_steam_users_the_anniversary_edition/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">$20 Fallout 4 Creations Bundle separately</a> from all of this and gain access to the new content included in the <em>Anniversary Edition.</em> Does any of this make sense to you?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642968" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642968"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642968">©</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, somehow, Bethesda has made buying a 10-year-old video game a complicated and confusing mess that now requires research and a fucking chart. And even if you figure it all out, some players are reporting that <em>Fallout 4</em> might not even load the new bundle properly due to various bugs.</p>

 <p>This all likely explains why <em>Fallout 4</em> on Steam has seen an influx of negative reviews. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3868650/Fallout_4__Creations_Bundle/">Meanwhile, the Creations Bundle on Steam has a completely negative review status,</a> with people furious over the price tag, how broken everything is, the fact that the new update broke many mods, and the confusion around all of this.</p>

 <p>“Hot garbage. My advice is to avoid buying this out of spite. Not only is this going to break your game, but the content itself is broken,” says one negative Steam review.</p> <p>And making all of this more frustrating is that just last year, Bethesda broke<em> Fallout 4</em> in a whole bunch of <em>different</em> but similarly annoying ways with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302">controversial “next-gen update.</a>” At this point, I think Bethesda needs to just fix <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s current mess, say sorry, and never, ever, ever update the game again. Just move on. Let it be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Back in the day when I used to main <i>Call of Duty</i>’s extraction mode, DMZ, any time my plans to play sniper boss on a tall tower went awry and I had to skedaddle, I’d just leap off of a building and, without much thought or concern, hit the ground and run and hide somewhere. It was cheap. But also, there was an infinite parachute on my back. It was a part of the game. Am I supposed to not use it?</p>

 <p>Well, as we’ve now seen for a little bit, you can kinda sorta do the same thing in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But instead of an infinite parachute, you can exploit how the game handles characters grabbing onto ledges to fall from incredible heights with basically no harm to your character. It’s not right. I don’t agree with it. You should stop doing it. Camp the extraction point? Fine. But if I see you do this ledge thing from somewhere ridiculous like the skyscraper-sized launch tower in Spaceport, I don’t care if you’re fighting a Leaper or are running from a Rocketeer. I’m hopping on the mic to have a conversation with you about unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>I first caught sight of this little exploit back when I wrote up a montage of all the hijinks that <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">unfolded during <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend</a>. I’d hoped that, amusing as it was to watch, it would be a little too tricky to pull off reliably. Well, no. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-crack-its-movement-tech-wide-open-by-mastering-the-ledge-grab/">Morgan Park over at <i>PC Gamer</i></a> has documented, folks have figured out how to do this reliably. But unlike my colleague, I don’t find it amusing.</p>

   <p>It essentially works like this: Fall from a great height but be sure there’s a ledge to grab waiting far below. Hold down the jump key or button while you’re falling and you’ll grab the ledge, your character’s arm sockets apparently absorbing the impact of falling from terminal velocity to cancel out all of the fall damage you right earned.</p>

 <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Embark Studios for comment on this “movement tech.”</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong. I do enjoy a good movement exploit when it feels like it requires a bit of mastery to pull off. “<a href="https://youtu.be/5QYRCVS7ix4">Curb sliding” in <i>Halo Infinite</i></a> (RIP) was one such thing. After sprinting, you could slide off a ledge to get a boost in speed. It was tricky to do, especially amidst the chaos of a good <i>Halo </i>match.</p>

 <p>But I don’t see that kind of skill in this ledge grab trick in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Being able to bail from a high vantage point without consequence feels a little too easy, and antithetical to the fairly grounded approach to combat <i>Arc Raiders</i> seems to be going for.</p> <p>Ledges and climbing are quite important in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, so much so that the game sometimes reminds me a little bit of <i>Uncharted</i>. As some folks have commented in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1kmrtjt/i_hope_this_doesnt_get_patched/">a Reddit post documenting the ledge-grab exploit</a>, grabbing onto a ledge from a great height is fine, but it shouldn’t cancel out fall damage. Especially when you’re jumping off something as tall as a skyscraper. Such silliness.</p>
