After it installs, you’ll have the option to trade any card that’s a 1-star or below in rarity with whoever is on your friends list. And that’s where things go off the rails. Fans have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iciykf/trades_are_very_expensive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1iciykf/trades_are_very_expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">losing their minds</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icta5n/trading_is_bad_on_purpose_so_they_can_make_money/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icta5n/trading_is_bad_on_purpose_so_they_can_make_money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about it all morning</a></span>. </p><p>To trade you need to have enough enough “trade stamina” which slowly refills over time or can be purchased for real money. You also need to have enough “trade tokens.” These are collected by trashing extra copies of cards you already own, and the results aren’t generous. Cards that are 2-diamond and below can’t be turned into trade tokens at all, and even 1-star cards only get you 100 tokens each.</p><p>Meanwhile, it costs 400 trade tokens to trade a single 1-star card with someone else. Both players are effectively trashing four cards, and trading a fifth, just to get one in return. It’s nuts, and yet somehow that’s not even the worst part. When you make someone on your friends list a trade offer, you pick which card to give away but you have no way of telling them what you want in return. The entire thing is ass-backwards. </p><p>The only way to really trade for any cards missing from you collection is to coordinate over DMs in another app or meet up IRL. It’s a weird set of hoops to jump through for very little payoff. You can’t trade for the rarest cards in the game, and new players won’t have nearly enough good cards to get the trade tokens they need to make a worthwhile swap. And even if they do, they’ll have to start DMing with a total rando or find that one friend who also plays <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> and happens to have a card they want. <br></p><p>“As a whale, this game isn’t getting another dime from me,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ick9qr/as_a_whale_this_game_isnt_getting_another_dime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ick9qr/as_a_whale_this_game_isnt_getting_another_dime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one hardcore player on Reddit. “This trading update is an insult.” Another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icjnwk/lets_face_it_the_game_does_not_want_you_to_trade/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1icjnwk/lets_face_it_the_game_does_not_want_you_to_trade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>, “Let’s face it, the game does NOT want you to trade cards.” When the game’s developers previewed trading earlier this month, it already seemed like a flawed system.

There may be hope, at least for the types of things players can trade in the future. “We’re planning to expand the range of cards that can be traded,” reads the fine print near the bottom of trading’s in-game announcement. Maybe the ability to trade rarer cards, including even gold crown cards, is coming in the future after all. For now, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s big trading extravaganza is a bust.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the overall format down to individual hero’s kits, NetEase copiedBlizzard’s homework and didn’t try to change it much. That being said, it’s nice that <em>Overwatch 2</em> has a direct competitor to put its feet to the fire, and if both of these games must co-exist, they both can learn a lot from each other. Here are six things <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>should steal from each other.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-recommend-id="image://b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Marvel Rivals teams face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Marvel Rivals teams face off." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-recommend-id="image://b365a117371f0f9726be7a02255b1f8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two Marvel Rivals teams face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>NetEase got off to a good start making <em>Marvel Rivals</em> cross-play compatible, meaning no matter if you’re playing the shooter on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X/S, you can play with your friends on different systems. However, one major difference between it and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>is that the game has no form of cross-progression. It took Blizzard years to implement it into <em>Overwatch </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-devs-confirm-cross-progression-is-in-the-works-but-platform-rules-remain-a-barrier&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-devs-confirm-cross-progression-is-in-the-works-but-platform-rules-remain-a-barrier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does have it coming in the near future</a></span>, but for the moment it’s still missing so I will complain. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is free-to-play so people can readily download it to play ranked matches on PC or console with their friends, but they can’t take their rewards and skins with them.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-recommend-id="image://ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reinhardt charges into battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Reinhardt charges into battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-recommend-id="image://ab5c4dcefb921c00bad4c93f1486d195" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reinhardt charges into battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are only a handful of heroes in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>that don’t use firearms or some kind of ranged weapon. Yeah, the “hero shooter” genre seems synonymous with shooting, but <em>Marvel Rivals </em>proves that differentiating your characters gives people more choice and playstyles for skill expression. Mister Fantastic and Captain America are two of my favorite heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and both are tanky melee heroes who get in close and brawl without a gun. I’d love to see more <em>Overwatch </em>heroes that don’t primarily point and shoot.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4956215f1251ebc83982f480bf6833aa" data-recommend-id="image://4956215f1251ebc83982f480bf6833aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="320" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The role symbols in Overwatch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The role symbols in Overwatch 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4956215f1251ebc83982f480bf6833aa" data-recommend-id="image://4956215f1251ebc83982f480bf6833aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="320" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The role symbols in Overwatch 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hold your fire. I’m not saying that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>should give up the chaotic, unbalanced mayhem for a polished competitive esport like <em>Overwatch </em>did. But having an option that lets you guarantee there will be some healing Strategists on your team separate from the free-for-all mode we have now hurts no one. It doesn’t even have to be a team-wide 2-2-2 role queue like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has, but maybe one that at least requires two healers so the team can comfortably experiment elsewhere in their composition. I don’t care what the Duelist one-tricks say, you cannot out-damage a team that has good healers when you have no one keeping you alive. So just give us some way to ensure there’s a Strategist on the team without having to berate each other to switch in the chat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-recommend-id="image://51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow, Loki, Storm, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Spider-Man are shown perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow, Loki, Storm, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Spider-Man are shown perched on top of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-recommend-id="image://51a8cf3b32927bf731e35eba20426e54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow, Loki, Storm, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Spider-Man are shown perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I could write another dozen paragraphs about how disappointing it is that <em>Overwatch 2 </em>seemingly abandoned its long-awaited story campaign. Instead, I’m going to shout out how <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has been integrating lore and forward narrative momentum into a genre that has historically struggled with it. On top of explicitly telling short stories within each map and match, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is adding lore drops, even if they’re just in text form at the moment, as part of its seasonal events. Each season’s theme plays into an actual story development occurring in the game’s multiverse, while <em>Overwatch </em>mainly uses its seasons to explore an aesthetic idea for skins. Blizzard has yet to publicly acknowledge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the reported cancelation of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s story missions</a></span>, but if there’s any hope of us seeing that story play out, integrating it into each season would be a great start.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-recommend-id="image://82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange opens a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange opens a portal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-recommend-id="image://82361f0871b18e7bc7f601d30acb51fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1955" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Doctor Strange opens a portal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A small quality-of-life change I’d like to see in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is the ability to immediately leave a game when it’s over, rather than having to sit through all the debriefing that follows. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can quit out of a match the second a team completes an objective and is declared the winner, allowing you to skip past the victory animation and play of the game clip and hop right back into the queue. This shaves off minutes of downtime between playing, and after years of being able to jump right out in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, I feel my momentum screech to a halt in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>as I’m forced to sit through the post-match breakdown. It’s a little thing, but I notice it every time I finish a match.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-recommend-id="image://9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mercy reaches out to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mercy reaches out to someone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-recommend-id="image://9f223ce5c235896add23e05f8c76aa3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mercy reaches out to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This has been my biggest takeaway while comparing <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. NetEase’s game feels like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>without all the baggage and expectations that come with being a competitive game with esports aspirations. It’s pretty unbalanced by most live-service standards, has more heroes than it knows what to do with just a month after release, and half the roster feels “broken.” But who gives a fuck? <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has lost so much of its sauce, cutting off big plays at the knees by reworking and flattening its characters, while <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’<em> </em>heroes make it feel like the <em>Overwatch </em>of old. Adam Warlock’s ability to revive his whole team like Mercy used to be able to in <em>Overwatch </em>echoes a simpler time. I like to believe <em>Overwatch 2 </em>isn’t so far gone that it can’t be like that again. They’re exploring going back to the 6v6 structure; hopefully that’s a sign that the old <em>Overwatch</em> spirit isn’t out of reach.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Another massive overhaul to the look and feel of its planets and solar systems has arrived in the form of the new Worlds Part II update<em>. </em>It’s the latest evolution of the game thanks to Hello Games’ ongoing work on its upcoming open-world survival RPG, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-light-no-fire-open-world-trailer-1851083189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-light-no-fire-open-world-trailer-1851083189"><em>Light No Fire</em></a></span>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>  “Across the universe we’re adding billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets, and introducing new biomes and terrains without changing what people already love about the game,” Hello Games director Sean Murray wrote in Worlds Part II’s announcement on Wednesday. “It’s now so far beyond what we ever thought was possible when we started out.”</p><p>The update makes terrain more detailed and varied with bigger mountains and more striking features. Oceans can be “several kilometers deep” now as well, and a new lighting system lets water reflect clouds, stars, physical objects and ships, while creatures will create more convincing ripples. In fact, ocean spaces seem like a particularly notable part of the update, with Murray promising new creatures lurking deeper beneath the sea than ever before in the game.</p><p>“The team is extremely busy on <em>Light No Fire</em>,” he wrote. “Each time we push our engine to new places though we have this urge to share it with the community, with <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.

The new update will similarly include a giant patch of tweaks to the underlying game, as well as another new questline and new expeditions to some of the new types of planets, showing off all of the changes. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
