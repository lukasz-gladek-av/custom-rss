              <p>After some teasing last week, Stern Pinball has officially unveiled its pricey <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-themed tables with a snazzy trailer. The question now is: Are you willing to pay $7,000 to fling steel balls at Meowth’s face?</p> <p>On February 13, Stern Pinball released a new trailer showing off its $7,000 <em>Pokémon</em> table, which features a large HD screen that plays clips from the anime series as well as a highly interactive playfield that includes a moving Pikachu and a Meowth balloon. Here’s the video:</p>  <p>Stern says players will be able to capture Pokémon while playing this pinball machine. And if you have a Stern account and log in via the app while playing, you’ll be able to collect Pokémon and check them out later on the app. As you’d expect from a modern pinball machine, the playfield is jam-packed with spinners, ramps, and targets to hit, all of which will cause Pikachu to react to how you’re playing.</p>

 <p>“Today we’re proud to finally deliver the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball machine,” <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">said Stern Pinball president</a> and CEO Seth Davis in a press release. “This game is a true celebration of nostalgia, craftsmanship, and the enduring adventure of Pokémon – brought to life in a whole new way through immersive pinball gameplay, thrilling battles, and the timeless excitement of catching <em>Pokémon</em>.”</p> <p>This all sounds cool, and if you find one at your local arcade or bar, it will likely be a lot of fun. However, if you want to buy one of these machines to stick in your basement or gaming room, you’ll need to drop at least $7,000 on the base model. There’s also a premium model that features different artwork, enhanced audio and visuals, and a fancier backglass, among other bonuses. Those don’t come cheap. This upgraded version will cost $9,700. Meanwhile, a limited-edition version of the table will set you back $13,000!</p>

 <p>If you can afford to grab this <em>Pokémon</em> table, first off, congrats on doing well in life. <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">And also, Stern is taking orders for its newly revealed <em>Pokémon</em> pinball machine right now on its website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the new tactical RPG roguelike about cat breeding, has come under a bit of fire during its launch week for its long list of voice cameos. Among </span><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/"><span>the eclectic group</span></a><span> of people who do the various “meow”s in the game are a fair number of content creators, including husband-and-wife podcast hosts Ethan and Hila Klein, both of whom have expressed </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qidsNawR9TE"><span>pro-Israel views in regards to its ongoing conflict with Palestine</span></a><span>. Hila was born in Israel and was required by law to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY"><span>serve in the Israel Defense Forces at 18,</span></a><span> albeit not in a combat role. After some criticism of their presence in the game on social media, the developers have responded.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate"><i><span>Rock Paper Shotgun</span></i></a><span>, developer Edmund McMillen explained that the giant list of meowers was accumulated over several years, with Ethan Klein’s contribution coming together four years before the game launched.</span></p> <p><span>“I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games,” McMillen told </span><i><span>RPS</span></i><span>. “As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This counterbalancing, as McMillen calls it, means recruiting people with different views, such as iDubbbz and Anisa Jombha, who have </span><a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102"><span>publicly supported Palestine</span></a><span>, to balance out people like Klein. iDubbbz and Klein have been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyB85pVw-v4"><span>publicly feuding</span></a><span> after the former released a video criticizing the latter’s stance on Israel. McMillen says he contacted both parties before </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ launch to make sure they knew the other would be in the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/"><span>gotten pushback for including Klein</span></a><span>, he says it’s “sad” that some might be “</span><span>so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game,”</span><span> though he doesn’t engage with the fact that at the heart of this disagreement is a literal genocide.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen said, “but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>McMillen says that someone who was bothered by a “problematic meow” would probably not enjoy </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>anyway, though he says that if you do still play the game, you can simply throw any offending cat in the trash and go about your way. </span></p>

              <p><span>Adding </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>five new heroes in one drop</span></a><span> was always going to be a balancing challenge, but Blizzard has managed to patch in some nerfs and buffs for all five of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> added heroes just a few days after they launched. It’s all pretty standard turning knobs and flipping switches, though I fear there’s nothing in here that’s going to make anyone who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>hates the chaotic menace that is Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> any happier.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/?blzcmp=app"><span>patch notes</span></a><span> aren’t that extensive, as the update seems to be mostly targeting a few pain points in Domina, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-face-comparison-change-voice-fareeha-2000666873"><span>Anran</span></a><span>, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki’s kits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><span>Vendetta</span></a><span> is also here, and since she was the last hero to join the roster before the big reboot, it makes sense she might still need some tinkering. It’s not all nerfs, though, as Anran and Mizuki have a few buffs in the mix. The full change log is as follows:</span></p>

 <h2><b>Domina</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Barrier Array</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Barrier Panel Health reduced from 250 to 225</span></p> <h2><b>Anran</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Zhuque Fans</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Impact damage increased from 20 to 22.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Fan the Flames</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Impact damage now uses beam damage against armor mitigation (Only reduced by 30% when used on armor).</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Inferno Rush</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Can now be canceled with quick melee.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ignition – Passive</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Burning build up linger time increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</span></p> <h2><b>Emre</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Synthetic Burst Rifle – Take Aim</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Falloff range increased from 30-45 to 35-50 meters.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cyber Frag</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Explosion damage minimum radius increased from 1.25 to 2 meters.</span></p> <h2><b>Jetpack Cat</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Frenetic Flight</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Regeneration rate reduced from 30 to 25.</span></p> <h2><b>Mizuki</b></h2> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Spirit Glaive</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Cast time reduced from 0.1 to 0.025 seconds.</span></p> <p><span>Recovery time increased from 0.7 to 0.75 seconds.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Healing Kasa</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Range increased from 25 to 30 meters.</span></p> <p><span>Default soft targeting range increased from 8 to 10 degrees.</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ultimate</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Ultimate cost increased by 7%.</span></p> <p><span>Now heals for 100 instant healing on cast.</span></p> <h2><b>Vendetta</b></h2> <p><span>Siphoning Strike – Minor Perk</span></p> <p><span>Lifesteal reduced from 40% to 30%.</span></p>
