              <p><span>Not all heroes wear capes. Some of them wear show-accurate </span><i><span>Power Rangers </span></i><span>cosplay. That’s what an anonymous hacker going by the pseudonym Martha Root did at a recent hacking conference where they used their hacking skills to delete white supremacist websites live on stage while dressed as the pink ranger.</span></p> <p><span>The Chaos Communication Congress is an annual convention held by the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, Germany. Root gave a presentation there alongside journalists Eva Hoffmann and Christian Fuchs which concluded with the hacker deleting the servers of white supremacist sites WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal live on stage.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/hacktivist-deletes-white-supremacist-websites-live-on-stage-during-hacker-conference/"><span>TechCrunch</span></a><span> lays out, these three sites are dedicated to racist match making, racist egg and sperm donations, and a racist labor marketplace. White people use these sites to make sure they only link up with other white people. The administrator of these sites confirmed on </span><a href="https://x.com/whitedatenet/status/2007852479179112852"><span>X</span></a><span> the servers were deleted in an act of “cyberterrorism.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Root also published personal data from these sites, including profile images and other information, but is holding back emails, passwords, and private conversations “for now.” The gender disparity in these sites is pretty telling, with Root noting that 86 percent of users were men, with women making up the additional 14 percent, a split they say “makes the </span><i><span>Smurfs</span></i><span> village look like a feminist utopia.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Imagine calling yourselves the ‘master race’ but forgetting to secure your own website — maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination,” Root said.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‼️A German hacker known as "Martha Root" dressed as a pink Power Ranger and deleted a white supremacist dating website live onstage</p> <p>This happened during the recent CCC conference.</p> <p>Martha had infiltrated the site, ran her own AI chatbot to extract as much information from users… <a href="https://t.co/vpTEoFR8JR">pic.twitter.com/vpTEoFR8JR</a></p> <p>— International Cyber Digest (@IntCyberDigest) <a href="https://twitter.com/IntCyberDigest/status/2007183888377118750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Slay.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-smart-play-brick-star-wars-march-interactive-sets-2000656727</link>
            <guid>1397770</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lego announced a big step forward in how kids will play with the company’s popular plastic bricks. Well, it’s actually really small. In fact, Lego’s new Smart Brick is the size of a standard 4×2 Lego brick, but it contains much of the same tech found in modern phones. And Lego is promising some cool features that will be powered by this new, tiny tech.</p> <p>On January 5, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/live-updates-from-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-2000697509">during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/december/lego-smart-play-announcement">Lego unveiled Smart Play</a>, a new smart system of Lego pieces that will work with all pre-existing Lego bricks. The main star of Smart Play is the Smart Brick, which basically acts as a tiny PC and the brains of any set using Smart Play. And this new Smart Brick is packed with tech. Lego says it includes light-sensing and sound-sensing sensors and accelerometers, as well as a “miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser” and a custom-built microchip that is smaller than a standard Lego stud. The Smart Brick is charged wirelessly and can snap into any set like a regular brick.</p>

  <p>So what can this new Smart Brick do? Well, if you include some of the other Smart Play Lego pieces, like Smart Tiles or Smart Minifigs, into a build, the Smart Brick can react to how kids play. For example, in a video posted by Lego, you can see kids attaching a propeller to a dinosaur, and when the propeller spins, the connected Smart Brick plays helicopter noises.</p>

 <p>In the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Star Wars</a></em> sets launching with Smart Play in March, the Emperor minifig will play the Imperial March when you sit him on this throne. Ships can blast at each other with laser noises, and lightsabers will hum and whirl when figures holding them are moved.</p>

 <p>Perhaps the most impressive part of all of this is that Lego has designed the system not to need a phone or computer. There is seemingly no app needed for any of these new Smart bits, which should make it very easy for a kid and their parents to set this up. In theory, you start building, and the Smart pieces interact as programmed. Sounds cool, and much better than some of Lego’s past attempts to combine tech and bricks, which often felt clunky and cumbersome as they involved phones, updates, cables, and other junk.</p>

 <p>We won’t have to wait too long to see if Lego’s big promises are real, as <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-unveils-the-smart-brick-and-smart-play-system-march-2026/">Smart Play is set to launch in three different Lego <em>Star Wars</em> sets in March</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[That Surprise Splinter Cell-Like From Last Year’s Xbox Showcase Might Be In Trouble]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736</link>
            <guid>1397746</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During last year’s Xbox Games Showcase, Korea-based developer EVR Studio announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mudang-two-hearts"><i><span>Mudang: Two Hearts</span></i></a><span>, a stealth action-adventure game with a notable resemblance to the </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> series. Now, the </span><a href="https://evrstudio.com/"><span>team’s website appears offline</span></a><span>, and reports hint at possible layoffs in the past few months.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://need4games.ro/en/mudang-two-hearts-might-be-in-trouble-evr-studio-facing-massive-layoffs"><span>reported by </span><i><span>Need4Games</span></i></a><span>, EVR allegedly laid off multiple people due to a lack of funding. The claim is based on a </span><a href="https://thevc.kr/evrstudio"><span>Korean tracking site</span></a><span>, which shows the number of employees decreasing from over a hundred to just 22 as of the time of publication.</span></p>

  <p><span>In addition, sources speaking to </span><i><span>Need4Games</span></i><span> were reportedly negative about the studio’s situation, with one of the investors of EVR Studio reportedly saying that </span><i><span>Mudang</span></i><span> is meant to be released by the end of March 2026, which is also the end of the current fiscal year. “If we don’t receive it, the investors will be very upset with the situation, then it will be their meeting,” reads the report.</span></p>

 <p><span>The outlet also reported a sudden silence in terms of online presence. EVR’s official website currently leads to an error message when accessed, and on </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251023031820/https://evrstudio.com/"><span>The Wayback Machine</span></a><span>, the latest backups of the site are dated October 23. Over at the studio’s YouTube channel, the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyYAYNA3FD4"><span>last developer diary</span></a><span>—which presented a motion-matching showcase—was uploaded back on August 15, and there have been no more updates since.</span></p>

 <p><span>On LinkedIn, there are </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/evr-studio/people/"><span>at least 34 people</span></a><span> associated with the EVR Studio company profile, although several of those profiles are private. All the public profiles, including those of CEO Yongki Yoon, co-founder, director, and executive producer Dong joon Min, art director Bryan ku, and UI designer Jihong Lee, showcase “present” in the respective Experience tabs of their profile, indicating they are still employed at the company.</span></p>

 <p><span>EVR also has a </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/mudang"><span>Discord server</span></a><span>, which shows over 2,300 members at the time of publication. As of now, the general chat channel is filled with people speculating about the state of the game based on the aforementioned reports, seemingly without an official response from the developer. The latest update, shared via a behind-the-scenes channel, was issued back on August 29.</span></p>

 <p><span>Back then, EVR said all development divisions were focused on validating the playable build to ensure stability, running regression testing and balance tuning. The team also added that the following dev diary update may experience a slight delay because of these tests. “Our team is fully committed to delivering a level of quality that will be recognized by players worldwide, and we look forward to sharing the next stage of progress with you soon,” reads the Discord message.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Mudang: Two Hearts</span></i><span> is slated to launch in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox consoles. According to EVR, </span><a href="https://x.com/TH_EVRSTUDIO/status/1948740945773822203"><span>the game hit 100,000 wishlists</span></a><span> by July 25 of last year.</span></p> <p><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> has reached out to EVR Studio for comment.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anthem-shutdown-download-bioware-ea-pc-app-play-2000656725</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’re just one week away from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>Electronic Arts shutting down </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>, BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-the-kotaku-review-1832885378"><span>questionable 2019 looter shooter detour</span></a><span> that failed to take off and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-says-it-s-giving-up-on-anthem-1846347391"><span>never got the second chance the RPG studio had promised</span></a><span>. According to the initial announcement, fans who bought the game would still be able to play it up until it finally goes offline forever on January 12. However, as the end date gets closer, some players who are trying to go take their Javelins out for one last spin have discovered they’re no longer able to open the game.</span></p> <p><span>We first took notice of this after seeing a few posts on X from users with screenshots showing that they were no longer able to download </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> after previously purchasing it at some point over the past seven years. The EA app instead told them they “don’t own” the game. I asked around and a friend who had the game through the EA Play subscription tried to download it to his PC and was told “this game is no longer offered in our catalog.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anthem is shutting down for good in a week, so I thought I'd play one more time.</p> <p>The EA App won't even let me download it even though I own it. <a href="https://t.co/spVNJd9six">pic.twitter.com/spVNJd9six</a></p> <p>— DansGaming (@Dansgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dansgaming/status/2008182733173141618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As others have  also reported, EA won't let me download Anthem, even though it shuts down a week from now… No "last hurrah" I guess. Crazy that I bought the game and can't even download it while it's still, allegedly, alive… <a href="https://t.co/cRu0s4DU1N">pic.twitter.com/cRu0s4DU1N</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/2008212887026741530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>However, this doesn’t seem to be a universal issue, as </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s Ethan Gach was able to download without issue from the EA Play app.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case may be, it seems like at least some </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>players who may have wanted to give the game one last try before BioWare and EA </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>needlessly send it tumbling down into a digital void</span></a><span> aren’t able to now. The mech shooter hasn’t&nbsp; been available for purchase since the original shutdown announcement back in July, but if you had a copy of it in your library or on a disc, you were supposed to have one more week to play it.</span></p>

 <p><span>We’ve reached out to EA and BioWare for comment on the situation, and will update this story if we hear back. This whole thing could’ve been avoided if BioWare had made </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> accessible offline, but the studio claims it “was designed to be an online-only title.” That’s in contrast to other failed live-service gambits like </span><i><span>Redfall</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, both of which received offline modes before being sent off to pasture. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/guy-behind-viral-focus-m-gaming-meme-never-expected-it-to-spread-so-fast-2000656706</link>
            <guid>1397668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Late last month, an old video showing off what a hypothetical AAA<em> Mario</em> game would look like went viral after two voice actors added new dialogue styled after that in blockbuster games like <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>Gears of War.</em> Now, a few weeks later, one line from the game, “Focus, M,” has spread across all corners of the web, annoying some and leading to a lot of online discourse.</p> <p>On December 23, voice actor Ryan Stewart uploaded a video featuring himself as Mario and another voice actor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arielhckva/?utm_source=ig_embed">Ariel Hack</a>, as Peach, talking to each other over comms as the famous plumber approaches Bowser’s castle. The original gameplay video featured in Stewart’s post was created by Funkyzeit as a conceptual mock-up of what a AAA Mario game might look like, and was shared online back in 2022. This new version, featuring dialogue perfectly parodying how some AAA games deliver narrative and tutorial information, quickly went viral online, with Stewart’s Twitter upload reaching over 25 million views as of January 5.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had no idea AAA Mario would be so popular. I had to make some more. 🍄<br>ft. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielHck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ArielHck</a> as Peach <a href="https://t.co/p3YMlF5rEn">https://t.co/p3YMlF5rEn</a> <a href="https://t.co/ggarxptMuZ">pic.twitter.com/ggarxptMuZ</a></p> <p>— Ryan Stewart (@RyanStewartVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanStewartVO/status/2002854369369452879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Quickly, one phrase from the video became popular: “Focus, M.” This line is delivered by Hack’s Peach after Mario makes a joke. It’s a pitch-perfect replication of the kind of AAA video game dialogue that was so prevalent in blockbuster single-player games from the Xbox 360 and PS4 generations, and which can still be found in some bigger games now. All of this dialogue, including the “Focus, M” line, was written by Stewart himself, who told <em>Kotaku</em> that while he didn’t expect the bit to go as viral as it has, he knew he had a “banger” on his hands once he heard it.</p>

 <p>“As I was writing the dialogue, I knew it was funny,” said Stewart via email. “Once I got Ariel’s reads in, though, I knew it would be a banger. That being said, the sheer amount of discussion it spawned after the fact was unexpected.”</p>

 <p>When asked for his thoughts on how “Focus, M” has become its own meme, with people using it who haven’t even seen the original video, Stewart told <em>Kotaku</em>:&nbsp; “If nothing else, I think it’s resulted in some excellent fan art! I hope my future posts can do the same.”</p>

 <p>While Stewart is pretty positive about “Focus, M,” some online aren’t. The original creator behind the AAA Mario video never replied to <em>Kotaku’s</em> request for comment, <a href="https://x.com/KingOfSuper/status/2004602334975001002">but did like a YouTube comment left by someone comparing them to Oppenheimer</a>, the man who created the nuclear bomb. That seems to indicate that, at the very least, Funkyzeit has mixed feelings about their involvement in “Focus, M.”</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, online, the “Focus, M” meme has rapidly evolved and spread. You can find people applying it to basically anything at this point. <a href="https://x.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199">New <em>Marathon</em> graphics?</a> That’s a “Focus, M” game. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xenobladeus.bsky.social/post/3maxn33scsk2x">PS1 platformer <em>Croc?</em></a> That’s a “Focus, M” game. <a href="https://x.com/freakofxeets/status/2004670291704942597"><em>Starfield</em>?</a> Sure, whatever, that’s a “Focus, M” game, too.</p>

 <p>At this point, the meme has already run its course and lost all meaning. It’s like people calling anything they don’t like slop. And you can find plenty of posts from people saying they feel the meme is dead already. I’m not so sure, though. I still regularly see people tagging new AAA games and remasters as “Focus, M” games. And I suspect that at least a few devs have been watching all of this and are possibly making some tweaks to dialogue in their own upcoming games. I feel certain that at least one game has likely removed or cut a line that asked the player to “Focus…” in response to all of this.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704</link>
            <guid>1397611</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ series finale continues to be a lightning rod for controversy. While plenty of people were fine with how the Netflix horror series wrapped up after a decade, there’s a loud subset of fans who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking to the digital streets</span></a><span> to tear it down, say awful things about the people who worked on it, and declare it the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>next </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>-level failure</span></a><span>. Another fraction of that group, however, is holding onto a bizarre sliver of hope with the belief that perhaps the disappointing conclusion is not all it seems. The movement, which is calling itself Conformity Gate, has gathered “evidence” indicating that the events depicted in the finale are actually an illusion and that there is still a battle left to fight, which will play out in a secret episode that’s not available on Netflix right now.</span></p>  <p><span>Obviously, we’ll be discussing the fifth season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> here, so if you want to stay spoiler free, you should leave now. (Really, you probably shouldn’t have opened this article to begin with.) But the tl;dr of the theory is that the sterile and rushed nature of the finale is an intentional creative choice meant to reflect that it takes place in a distorted reality created by Vecna and everyone in the show is “conforming” to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Admittedly, I fully planned to just roll my eyes at all this pretty wild speculation because I lived through the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>ending controversy and the Indoctrination Theory, which fans believed explained that game’s finale as a hallucination but was really just a way for them to cope with not liking the way things turned out. But, I don’t know, there’s </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>compelling evidence in the theory, both based on what’s in the show and on how Netflix and show creators the Duffer Brothers have talked about it since.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many of these details are subtle, such as the way that characters sit during the graduation scene resembling how villain Vecna sits at other points in the series, whereas others seem to be pretty overt, like Max calling out Mike’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>epilogue for being too comforting, as if something is off. Here’s one of the quicker rundowns I could find, by @meechski on TikTok, but you can also find </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAQbdjjaJk&amp;pp=ygUfY29uZm9ybWl0eSBnYXRlIHN0cmFuZ2VyIHRoaW5ncw%3D%3D"><span>much lengthier breakdowns on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>Also, as someone in the comments of that video points out, if you search “conformity gate” or “fake ending” on Netflix, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is the only search result for the latter, and one of two for the former alongside </span><i><span>Emily in Paris</span></i><span>. Make of that what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t know that any one thing made me a full-blown believer, but taken all together, it was enough for me to at least become interested in seeing if it actually pans out. Conspiracy theories usually have at least </span><i><span>some</span></i><span> shred of plausibility that allows them to gain some traction, but they also tend to be made up of a lot of square pegs shoved into round holes.

              <p><span>Hypixel Studios, developer of the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired survival game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, has shown the sandbox game’s modding capabilities with a </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors-</span></i><span>like prototype that has fans excited ahead of the game’s Early Access launch later this month. In a </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658"><span>social media post</span></a><span> over the weekend, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared a 40-second gameplay clip showcasing a character fending off voxel-based hordes of enemies in a top-down view arena.</span></p> <p><span>According to Collins-Laflamme, the video shows a </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> mod created by a team member in their spare time, and it’s intended as a proof-of-concept demo for “how different genres” could be realized within the game by fans and modders.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The following video showcases a server-side Hytale mod created by a Hytale team member in their spare time. It’s intended purely as inspiration for how different genres could be realized within Hytale! </p> <p>The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding… <a href="https://t.co/YaszQv9kDb">pic.twitter.com/YaszQv9kDb</a></p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding capabilities and was used to build a simple, survivor-like experience,” Collins-Laflamme wrote. While the mod is not planned for release as part of the game, Hypixel “may publish it – or similar examples – as reference material for the community.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The video comes less than two months after Hypixel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-hypixel-riot-canceled-revived-gameplay-minecraft-2000645466"><span>reacquired the rights</span></a><span> to</span><i><span> Hytale </span></i><span>from </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> maker Riot Games, which had previously canceled the project in June of last year. The team released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-price-low-minecraft-hypixel-2000646230"><span>16-minute gameplay trailer shortly afterwards</span></a><span>, but the latest clip is focused on </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> potential to be a springboard for user-generated content like the Mojang hit that inspired it.</span></p>

 <h2>Hytale is gearing up for Early Access</h2> <p><span>“My prediction is, it will do very well initially and then it will slow down until the modders / servers and us start to release some major content and then it will keep growing for years to come. Especially as we add more modding tools and options,” Collins-Laflamme </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006936928026026273"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span>, responding to a user who suggested that </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> release “will probably be something huge.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The reply came from a larger thread in which the co-founder expressed feeling “anger” as the studio gets closer to the early access launch of this new version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which is slated for January 13. According to Collins-Laflamme, that’s due to pouring four years of engineering into rebuilding the game’s engine rather than working on gameplay features. In his eyes, that leaves the team with a “four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do,” alongside a rebuilt engine that is “never gonna be used.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As previously </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq"><span>stated by the developer in a FAQ</span></a><span>, the sandbox won’t be available on Steam at launch in order to focus on its existing community. That’s to avoid chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.” Hypixel explained that while it doesn’t shy away from “honest, negative criticism,” the team is more interested in feedback from players who are already familiar with the game’s development background.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most importantly, the FAQ notes that Steam “currently doesn’t support” some of </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> modding features, and that the developer “will be in contact with Valve in the near future” to try and fix that. Otherwise it might be a while before Steam users get to recreate the platform’s latest hits inside</span><i><span> Hytale</span></i><span>. </span></p>
