            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>launched last December, it’s been hit with well-founded accusations of ripping off </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>. From gameplay modes to hero kits, NetEase’s superhero shooter is chock-full of what feel like direct pulls from Blizzard’s trailblazing game. But now that </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>has been out long enough for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>to be learning from it, the rip-off accusations have come full circle. The latest target of such critiques is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s new hero Vendetta</span></a><span>, who </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>fans argue is similar to one of its heroes because she…uses a big sword, I guess.</span></p> <p><span>Though the realities of how long it takes to develop content for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>are at odds with a lot of these claims, the internet loves a narrative. If Blizzard introduces a third-person mode a few months after </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>launches, those committed to misunderstanding how video game development works will hoop and holler about how Blizzard is chasing NetEase’s success, despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s third-person Stadium mode</span></a><span> having been in development far longer than the few months its competitor had been on the market.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, however, it’s been long enough that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>can introduce a character or concept that could have conceivably been pulled from </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, and fans are accusing Vendetta, with her sword-based fighting style and mobility skills, of being modeled on Magik from NetEase’s game. Others, meanwhile, are pointing out that “lady with big sword” is hardly a trademarked concept, and arguing that </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>should be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-role-queue-cross-progression-1851749687"><span>learning from each other</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone’s going to say Overwatch copied Marvel Rivals when they see Vendettas gameplay aren’t they <a href="https://t.co/bg2TDmHika">pic.twitter.com/bg2TDmHika</a></p> <p>— Frankiep423 (@frankiep423) <a href="https://twitter.com/frankiep423/status/1991567486026936570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"copy my homework, just dont make it obvious"<br>the homework: <a href="https://t.co/BiThZ3qibd">pic.twitter.com/BiThZ3qibd</a></p> <p>— Andrew (@whyAndr3w) <a href="https://twitter.com/whyAndr3w/status/1991690771033125216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Literally Magik gameplay 😭 <a href="https://t.co/eEBJnveNw9">https://t.co/eEBJnveNw9</a></p> <p>— 𐌀Ᏽ𐌀𐌌Ꝋ𐌕𐌕Ꝋ (@AgamottoSupreme) <a href="https://twitter.com/AgamottoSupreme/status/1991574897655730322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah because Rivals totally invented the "woman with big sword" concept.

But that’s pretty common with any two games with a public rivalry. </span><i><span>Call of Duty </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Battlefield </span></i><span>are always pitted against each other, with each new entry learning from the previous year’s successes and failures, and implementing features that look suspiciously like something the other has done. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Progress in any sport comes down to understanding your numbers. To get better, you need a clear picture of what you’re aiming for—and a way to keep tabs on it. Whether you’re starting to run, hitting the trails, diving into the pool, or tackling any outdoor activity, a good GPS watch can be the tool that keeps you focused and moving forward instead of losing momentum.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5796/"> Samsung happens to have its newly released for 2025 model of the its smart watches—the Galaxy Watch 8—on sale ahead of Black Friday.</a> Normally this smart watch goes for $350 for the 40mm model, but right now you can save 20%. That brings the price down to just $280. Likewise, the 44mm model is one sale for 18% off. That one comes down from $380 to just $310 for a limited time.</p>

<h2>Your Own Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="127" data-end="690">The Galaxy Watch 8 is driven by Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform. When you head out for a bike ride, a jog, or any outdoor training session, the watch lets you track and compare your live performance against your past activity data. Throughout the day, it delivers wellness prompts and tailored recommendations designed to keep you progressing toward your personal fitness and health goals. Galaxy AI also enhances workout monitoring with upgraded heart-rate analysis that filters out natural body movements, offering a more precise reading than previous generations.</p>
<p data-start="692" data-end="1042">Your sleep patterns are closely monitored as well, helping detect potential signs of sleep apnea and providing deeper insights into your nightly rest. Each day, you can check a summarized energy level and physical readiness score that factors in your sleep quality, daily step count, heart-rate trends, and more to paint a clearer picture of your overall physical state.</p>
<p data-start="1044" data-end="1476" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Beyond fitness tracking, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 supports your everyday tasks as a full-featured smartwatch. You can view and reply to messages directly from your wrist without reaching for your phone. When paired with your smartphone, it even doubles as a remote camera controller, letting you take group photos or selfies from afar while adjusting settings, activating the timer, or triggering the shutter right from the watch.</p>


<h2 data-start="1044" data-end="1476">Improvements This Generation</h2>
<p>Among the improvements in Galaxy Watch 8 over its predecessor—the Galaxy Watch 7—you’ll find a slimmer, sleeker design. The new model has more of a square-shaped bezel with the screen going much brighter. The Galaxy Watch 8 is capable of reaching up to 3,000 nits of brightness while the Watch 7 comes in at a max of 2,000 nits, making the new watch easier to see in direct sunlight. Both the 8 and the 7 are built to withstand harsh weather conditions so you can take it outside training year round, rain or shine.</p>
<p>You’ll also see improvements to battery life as well. There are two versions of the Galaxy Watch 8, and each use a different size battery. On the 40mm model, you get a 325mAh battery and on the 44mm, you get a much larger 435mAh battery. Both of which come in at a higher capacity than their Watch 7 counterparts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5796/">The Galaxy Watch 8 comes built from the ground up for use with Gemini—Samsung and Google’s AI assistant.</a> Use it to manage your calendar, respond to texts, set reminders—you name it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-multi-platform-steelseries-gaming-headset-will-boost-your-audio-and-comms-for-barely-over-100s-2000645993</link>

              <p data-start="75" data-end="854">Upgrade your gaming experience by investing in quality audio. If you’ve been relying on the standard speakers built into your television, you’re in for a dramatic improvement. Transitioning from basic TV sound to a dedicated over-the-ear gaming headset is like discovering you’ve needed glasses your entire life, only to finally put them on and see clearly. Suddenly, subtle details come alive. The soft scuffle of enemy footsteps, the direction of distant gunfire, or the echo of movement in a cavernous environment. With proper spatial audio, you gain the ability to pinpoint opponents with sound alone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/">Fortunately, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X multi-platform gaming headset is now available at a 30% discount, dropping its price from $150 to just $105 ahead of Black Friday.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="856" data-end="1431">What Makes the Arctis Nova 5X Stand Out</h2>
<p data-start="856" data-end="1431">Though the Arctis Nova 5X is built with Xbox consoles in mind—both in terms of design and technical optimization—it’s a flexible headset that works across a wide range of systems. It’s compatible with Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. It also supports VR devices and mobile platforms, making it a versatile audio solution for varied gaming environments. The fit is designed for lasting comfort, featuring an adjustable steel headband paired with memory-foam ear cushions that keep you cool and comfortable during long play sessions.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="2027">The headset’s magnetic drivers deliver an exceptionally detailed sound profile. You’ll hear crisp highs, accurate mids, and rich low frequencies that bring game worlds to life. The Arctis Nova 5X also supports 360° spatial audio, allowing you to get the most out of the next-gen audio systems built into your console and hear sound coming from all directions. The sound levels are customizable. You can choose between over 100 Xbox presets in the Arctis Nova 5 companion app on your smartphone.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="2027">Wireless connectivity is fast and dependable. The headset connects over a portable USB-C dongle, ensuring a lag-free, lossless audio experience. A USB-C to USB-A cable is also included, giving you flexibility when you need to plug in.</p>


<p data-start="2029" data-end="2392">Battery life is another standout here. The Arctis Nova 5X delivers up to 60 hours of use on a single charge, meaning you can game for days without plugging in. When you do need power in a pinch, USB-C Fast Charge support gives you six hours of playtime after just 15 minutes of charging—perfect for those moments when you’re eager to jump back into the action.</p>
<p data-start="2394" data-end="2904">The headset’s dual-audio capabilities allow you to stay connected beyond your console. By linking your mobile device simultaneously, you can take phone calls during a gaming session, listen to podcasts while grinding through hunts in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, or coordinate strategies with friends over Discord while battling opponents in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. And if you’re only interested in game audio and not chatting, the retractable microphone tucks away neatly, keeping the headset’s profile clean and unobtrusive.</p>
<p data-start="2906" data-end="3081"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5800/">For a limited time, you can take advantage of a 30% discount on the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X, bringing this quality gaming headset down to an appealing price of just $105.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modders celebrate <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-new-update-next-gen-patch-stop-bethesda-mods-1851473401">10 years of improving <em>Fallout 4</em></a> with their own anniversary collection, Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt earns a big defender, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334">very good Analogue 3D</a> (I’ve tested it but still need to publish my full review) is finally getting a Bluetooth N64 controller that actually looks cool. Welcome to the latest edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Black Friday season which means I’m about to stock up on extra controllers to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. It’s not great that modern game pads cost more than ever and wear out twice as fast.</p> <h2>Modders have put together their own <em>Fallout 4</em> Anniversary Collection</h2> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15406">The package includes</a> a curated round-up of all of the community’s favorite free fan-made add-ons for Bethesda’s decade-old RPG. But the <em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Collection</em> is more than that. “It’s a thank-you to the creators who’ve kept <em>Fallout 4</em> evolving long after launch, and a gift to players returning to the Wasteland with fresh eyes,” wrote Nexus user ModularCocoon. “Whether this is your first playthrough in years or your fifteenth settlement build this month, this is the Commonwealth at its most refined: a snapshot of what ten years of modding can achieve.”</p>

 <p>That’s in contrast to the official update from Bethesda which recently messed a bunch of things up and drove the game down to its lowest user rating ever on Steam with “overwhelming negative” reviews. “Game has been out for a decade and received two recent updates,” one player wrote. “I still get a black screen on startup and have to track down an ini file to make it work.” Bethesda is <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-patch-anniversary-edition-hot-fix-bethesda-2000643952">trying to fix it</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> devs promise to fix the new motion blur issue</h2> <p>The 2023 release recently received its new, free <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC expanding on Basim’s adventure with new content and new parkour options. But it also got rid of the ability to toggle motion blur off, in addition to tuning up the effect way beyond what fans were used to. It’s been making players dizzy and making the game look bad. Ubisoft promised it’s <a href="https://x.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1991544515702784466">prioritizing a fix</a> to add the settings toggle back in ASAP.</p>

 <h2>One Geralt compliments another</h2> <p>Doug Cockle, who voices Geralt in the <em>Witcher</em> video games, says Liam Hemsworth, who now plays him in Netflix’s&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em> series, is doing a fine job, despite season 4’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-season-4-reviews-liam-hemsworth-2000640506">abominable reception and ratings</a>.</p> <p>“I loved Henry. He was a fantastic Witcher, Geralt, specifically, so I was sad to see him go, but I have watched the newest season, and I think Liam holds up pretty well,” Cockle <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/geralts-game-actor-says-he-was-sad-to-see-henry-cavill-go-but-that-liam-hemsworth-holds-up-pretty-well-in-the-witcher-season-4-hes-made-it-his-own-character/">told <em>GamesRadar</em></a>. “He’s different. He’s made it his own character, and that’s what he should have done as an actor, and I think he’s done a fantastic job. So I’m looking forward to seeing Season Five eventually, and seeing where it goes.”</p>

 <h2>This is the N64-style gamepad the Analogue 3D should have shipped with</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller for Analogue 3D (Grey) up for preorder on 8BitDo ($44.99) <a href="https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E">https://t.co/Jd9OH3869E</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8Si5rhRsQ">pic.twitter.com/P8Si5rhRsQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1991538298934747585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>8bitdo<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-64-bluetooth-controller"> just revealed</a> a gray variant of its Bluetooth controller for its new retro console that plays Nintendo 64 games. It’s $45 and looks great compared to the all-black base model, but it’s not shipping until the end of January 2026. Hopefully, it has a better thumbstick than the current Analogue 3D controllers as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur</em> could get an <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair drop</h2> <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> designer Gavin Verhey said he’s into the idea of a collaboration with the surprise turn-based RPG hit of 2025. “My general theory recently is that gaming brands are just really good collaborations for <em>Magic</em>,” he <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/magic-the-gathering/lead-magic-the-gathering-dev-is-hoping-for-a-clair-obscur-expedition-33-collab-3282548/">told <em>Dexerto</em></a>. “When you bring someone new in with a gaming collaboration, they’re already gamers. You don’t have to explain what hit points are, what an objective is, or what mana is. They just get it.”</p>

 <p>He added, “I mean, it’s the talk of the town this year right? <em>Expedition 33</em> would be really fun to get to do…who knows if it’ll happen or if they’re even up for that kind of thing, right?”</p> <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> sneaks onto Xbox Series X/S</h2> <p>The remake port was quietly shadow-dropped this week with a big 50 percent off discount. Any Xbox fans who haven’t already played it on another platform can grab it for just $35, which is almost as good as having it on Game Pass (or even better for those who prefer to own). Konami <a href="https://t.co/DAImTnGEDc">recently teased</a> that it’s planning more<em> Silent Hill</em> games in addition to the recently released <em>Silent Hill f</em> and an in-development remake of <em>Silent Hill 1</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835">Xbox’s surprise showcase yesterday had some neat surprises, including <em>Echo Generations 2</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/where-winds-meet-game-reddit-steam-reviews-2000645900"><em>Where Winds Meet</em> is Steam’s latest big free-to-play MMO and it’s full of weird stuff</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/expedition-33-verso-actor-ben-starr-speech-awards-layoffs-2000645930"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> swept the Golden Joystick awards and actor Ben Starr had a message for the industry</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through the day. These are great to stay productive, but things can often get a little messy on the connectivity side. Before you know, you’re dealing with a whole bunch of cables and adapters on your desk; not a good sight.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make your workstation cleaner and more efficient, investing in a docking station can be a smart choice. These tiny but mighty devices serve as a connectivity hub, letting you add multiple external peripherals at the same time, plus charge your essentials as well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5535/">Today is a great time to pick a top-rated option, as Amazon’s early Black Friday sale has dropped the price of the 14-port Anker Prime Docking Station by 30%.</a> It’s now available for just $210, after a whopping $90 discount. The deal applies to the gray color option and is open to all shoppers. The black version is going for $272 (down from $340), but the discount is exclusive to Prime members on that one. Note that most early deals wrap up before the event, which means this one is only around for a limited time. It’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for Multiple Essentials</h2>
<p>Anker has packed this docking station with 14 ports in total. You’re getting a 140W 10Gbps USB-C upstream port, two 100W 10Gbps USB-C ports, one 100W 5Gbps USB-C port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, two 5Gbps USB-A ports, one 480Mbps USB-A port, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, a headphone and mic combo jack, and SD and TF card slots. That’s enough to add all your essentials without feeling limited. Think mouse, keyboard, laptop, external monitors, headphones, external storage, and more.</p>
<p>The three USB-C ports at the front support both charging and data transfer. You can juice your laptop up with up to 140W via the upstream port, and use the rest to charge other devices. The full 140W power can be achieved when you only have the laptop connected at the front. The two HDMI and DisplayPort let you add up to three external monitors to your setup simultaneously, including one in 8K.</p>



<p><strong>The station is compatible with both macOS 13.5 or later and Windows 10/11</strong>, but you will need to install the latest DisplayLink driver if you want to add more screens to the setup. It’s not that complicated, as all that you need to do is head over to the Anker website, find the DisplayLink installer that matches your system, and proceed with the download. Just make sure to uninstall any older versions of the driver already on your system, and then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. macOS users will also need to enable screen recording and allow the driver to launch automatically after login to proceed.</p>
<p>The process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and once it’s done, you can enjoy multitasking on a bigger setup. Take video calls on one screen and present using the other. Or work on your main display, while having reference material and relevant documents open on the others! The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a smart display on the front, just above the USB-C ports. It provides real-time updates on charging power, display performance, and other settings. Anker has even included a built-in fan paired with ActiveShield 3.0 to keep things cool as the docking station works. The box comes with the docking station itself, USB-C to USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 cable for upstream port (3.3 ft, 10 Gbps), 6ft AC power cord, safety sheet with user manual, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Get your orders in fast, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up to the not-so-friendly $300.</p>
