              <p>When it became obvious there was going to be no new mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> game in 2025, it raised a huge question about what would happen to the <em>Pokémon</em> TCG. The three-yearly cycle had become so normal that the card game was built around it, releasing sets themed around the new monsters and mechanics added to each new gaming entry, so what would it do when that was taken away? The answer, it turned out, was the revival of Mega Evolution, loosely tied into the events of <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Z-A</em>, but mostly just doing its own nostalgic thing. But now we know that <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Winds</em> and&nbsp;<em>Waves</em> won’t be out until 2027! So what then? Step forward, the 30th Anniversary Set.</p> <p>During the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383">30th anniversary Pokémon Presents</a>, among its lacking assortment of announcements, there was a brief appearance of the <em>TCG—</em>albeit a very opaque one. The one solid piece of information we received was that the new cards will—for the first time ever—release simultaneously worldwide. Cards are usually released in Japan first, in the country’s own bespoke sets, and then repurposed for the rest of the world in differently arranged and titled collections.</p>

 <p>The minute-long inclusion showed a range of favorite cards from the last 30 years, often in non-English versions, before faux-interrupting itself to reveal Mew and Mewtwo seemingly on some sort of LSD trip. But nothing tangible, nothing we could infer. Could it be the case that this wasn’t a gallery of old faves, but potentially cards that will be included in the new sets?</p>  <p>That’s what’s being claimed by some sites, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/30th-anniversary-set-classic-cards"><em>Wargamer</em></a>, convinced that the cards shown will be part of this celebratory series of sets. And you can see why, given the clip is so infuriatingly uninformative, and especially the choice to show the classic cards in very many different languages, and then finishing on the news that it will release simultaneously worldwide. It seems to speak to this international approach.</p>

 <p>I’m not convinced. I think the intention here was to fly through the TCG’s 30-year history, given the cards appeared in chronological order, beginning with that classic Chonkachu #58 and the infamous holo Charizard from the Base Set (although here shown as Glurak, its German name), before jumping to a French Palkia Lv. X from <em>Diamond </em>&amp;<em> Pearl</em>‘s Great Encounters and a Japanese Lugia from Wind from the Sea (2008 and 2002 respectively). We then get a Spanish Uxie Lv. 55 from Legends Awakened (also 2008), followed by the briefest glimpse of both halves of the Darkrai &amp; Cresselia Legend from <em>HS</em> Triumphant (2010), a Genesect EX from 2013’s Pokémon Blast, and a Chinese Solgaleo GX (2017 for the English version). Finally there’s a burst of four: Pikachu &amp; Zekrom’s Tagteam from 2019’s Team Up in Thai, Zacian V from 2020’s Sword &amp; Shield base set in Korean, Arceus VSTAR from 2022’s Brilliant Stars in Indonesian, and finally a silver-edged Amazing Rare Raikou from Pokémon’s 2020 arrival in Chinese.</p>

 <p>The only oddity in there is that Chinese Solgaleo GX, as at that point the game hadn’t launched in China. It was, however, released as part of the Chinese Storming Emergence Radiant set in 2022, making it a&nbsp;<em>really</em> weird pick for this montage. My suspicion is less that this is an indication of a new version of the card, and more that someone made a cock-up.</p> <p>There is of course precedent for re-releasing classic cards as part of an anniversary collection. For the 25th birthday in 2021, Celebrations was released which included the 25-card Classic Collection featuring reprints of various cards from the previous years, marked by a Pikachu head. Then there was 2016’s XY Evolutions that was primarily made up of reprints of Base Set cards, infuriatingly similar to the originals but for a tiny set symbol. So, yeah, it’s entirely possible.</p>

 <p>We’ve reached out to Pokémon to see if we can get any clarification, but given <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/celebration-collection-set-name-trademarked-for-the-pokemon-tcg"><em>PokeBeach</em> is claiming</a> the sets won’t start releasing until October of this year, it seems likely the company will keep quiet about it until nearer the end of this Mega Evolutions era.</p>

              <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450">Amazon released the first photo from the live-action <em>God of War</em> series</a> starring Ryan Hurst as Kratos and Callum Vinson as Atreus. It didn’t look great to me. And looking around online, it’s clear I’m not alone in thinking this first tease looks bad.</p> <p>While you can definitely find some positive and neutral online reactions to the image put out by Amazon on Friday, a lot of users on the web seem unconvinced by the first set photo of Kratos and his son. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-tv-show-amazon-last-of-us-expanse-1849895011">First announced in 2022</a>, the <em>God of War</em> live-action series could end up being great. Perhaps this image is just a bad first impression of the series we’ll get later. That’s very possible! But it doesn’t change how meh Kratos in particular looks in this initial photo, which is why so many online pulled out knives and went after it on social media.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/pPqgfd3CUX">pic.twitter.com/pPqgfd3CUX</a></p> <p>— Mikel Niño (@Belegurx) <a href="https://twitter.com/Belegurx/status/2027407787429441834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="es" dir="ltr">Esto lo he visto yo antes en otra parte… <a href="https://t.co/7uDxOiOgw7">https://t.co/7uDxOiOgw7</a> <a href="https://t.co/KP75bFZoZK">pic.twitter.com/KP75bFZoZK</a></p> <p>— RetroFlama (@RetroFlama) <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroFlama/status/2027403724025385452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/PnVU0o5ZZu">https://t.co/PnVU0o5ZZu</a> <a href="https://t.co/Iu0pmSAUkv">pic.twitter.com/Iu0pmSAUkv</a></p> <p>— aLexBY11 (@aLexBY11) <a href="https://twitter.com/aLexBY11/status/2027414004633596174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>        <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bring him back <a href="https://t.co/2WthKKEaG9">pic.twitter.com/2WthKKEaG9</a></p> <p>— ItsRichard (@Richyc89) <a href="https://twitter.com/Richyc89/status/2027402304614171119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>        <p>First announced in 2022, the <em>God of War</em> live-action series on Amazon doesn’t have a release date yet.

              <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game is announced, folks are wondering what returning monsters will make the cut this time. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> are coming to Switch 2</span></a><span> next year, and we saw quite a few returning critters on the roster just in the first few minutes of footage Game Freak revealed at today’s Pokémon Presents.</span></p>  <p><span>Thus far, the only new Pokémon we know of are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-wind-waves-starters-gecqua-browt-pombon-2000674400"><span>the three starters</span></a><span>: Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua. Other than that, every other monster that was shown in the game thus far originates from the previous generations. As such, we have a pretty good idea of what some of the Pok</span><span>é</span><span>dex is going to look like. Here is a big ol’ list of all the Pokémon we know of so far:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Brow</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pombon</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Gecqua</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pikachu</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Gloom</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tropius</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wailmer</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wailord</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Nymble</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tailow</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tangela</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Oddish</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ledyba</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ledian</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Slugma</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sizzlipede&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wingull</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Krabby</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sandygast</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Corsola</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mareanie</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Toxapex</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tympole</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Carnivine</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Duskull</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lumineon</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tynamo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Frillish</span></li> </ul> <p><span>As those are all seen in the trailer, it’s likely their evolutions will be in the game as well, assuming they don’t get some kind of regional variant that changes their evolution line. Those include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pichu</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Vileplume</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Bellossom</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lokix</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Swellow</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tangrowth</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Macargo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Centiskorch&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Pelipper</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Kingler</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Palossand&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Palpitoad</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Seismitoad</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Jellicent</span></li> </ul> <p><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> are coming to Switch 2 next year, meaning there will be a two-year gap between </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, the last RPG in the series which launched in October 2025, and its successor. It doesn’t sound like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans will be wanting for things to look forward to in 2026, though, as The Pokémon Company is celebrating the franchise’s 30th anniversary with events and new games like </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After quite a few leaks, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>have finally been officially unveiled today as part of the series’ 30th anniversary. In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, we saw </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-gen-10-starters-pikachu-vacation-reactions-2000674403"><span>the games’ starter trio</span></a><span>, but otherwise we only saw old monsters that debuted in previous games. However, fans think the few minutes of footage we got may offer a hint about one of the Legendary Pokémon we’ll meet when the games launch next year.</span></p> <p><span>In two sections of the trailer, you can see a cloud formation that looks kind of like a dragon. The first time is in the opening cinematic when a trainer is looking through their drawings of Pikachu in various regions. The final image in this section is one of Pikachu looking out a window into </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ ocean region, and you can see the dragon-shaped cloud in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hey it appears in the art at the start too <a href="https://t.co/RXHtwi1iOY">pic.twitter.com/RXHtwi1iOY</a></p> <p>— Puppi 🏳️‍⚧️ (@PuppiPoppi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuppiPoppi/status/2027403817147412543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Later, in one of the environmental shots, you can see the dragon-shaped cloud prominently in the sky in-game. Given the games’ titles, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>Winds</span></i><span>’ mascot legendary was a flying-type Dragon Pokémon and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>got some kind of sea creature. Some are speculating this is a Gyarados’ silhouette, and while the one in the initial sketch from the beginning of the trailer definitely resembles the Water/Flying monster from Kanto, the one we see in the actual game itself doesn’t look like it much at all. Could this be a nod to a Pokémon we haven’t met yet?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, there might be a different explanation based on </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ leaks. Though it hasn’t been officially revealed, the games’ equivalent of raid battles will reportedly be signified in the open world by Pokémon-shaped clouds. So it’s possible this might actually be a Gyarados rather than a new monster, but this also doesn’t preclude it from being a different monster entirely.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Based on the Teraleak, the Pokémon shaped clouds are just the new equivalent raid mechanic. <a href="https://t.co/xG0gUHfu0H">pic.twitter.com/xG0gUHfu0H</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027400325032779788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>are coming to Switch 2 next year, making them the first exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs on the system. I would’ve expected the original Switch to get at least one more </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG given how many Switches have been sold in the past nine years, but if you’re looking for a system seller, the new </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games will do it.</span></p>
