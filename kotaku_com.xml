              <p>Every version of the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">is now $50 more expensive</a> in the U.S., but at least for now, a new deal at GameStop will cover the difference. The meme stock retailer announced it will start giving anyone who trades in their last-gen consoles an extra $50 in-store credit toward the purchase of a new PS5.</p> <p>This deal applies to anyone trading in an old PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. If you really want a PS5, it‚Äôs better than nothing. The all-digital edition, the cheapest Sony offers, is now $500 starting August 21. So instead of just getting $55 toward that from trading in a PS4, you‚Äôll get $110. An Xbox One currently trades for about $45, so just $95 total. The Switch isn‚Äôt much better. You‚Äôll only get $60 for it before the new bonus credit, even though Nintendo recently raised the price of a new one to $340.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúOffer valid through 8.23.25‚Äù is in such small print at the bottom lol</p> <p>GameStop only has your back for a few days üíÄ</p> <p>‚Äî Carlton (@carlton_ec08) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlton_ec08/status/1958345035302240471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Xbox Series X/S owners looking to move over to PlayStation will have it a little easier. A Series S, now sold new at $370, will still get you up to $176, while a Series X, sold for $600, will get you up to $300. I could see taking that. When it comes to the other consoles, the price difference is harder to swallow. GameStop also buries in the fine print that this <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">bonus Trump tariff credit</a> will only be active through August 23.</p> <p>Is it better than nothing? Sure! But it still lowkey sucks in the worst way. This whole thing is basically GameStop saying, ‚ÄúReckless trade policy has hiked the price of a PS5, so here‚Äôs a bonus credit for these already terrible trade-in values that you‚Äôll have to give right back to us.‚Äù GameStop‚Äôs edgelord CEO Ryan Cohen, despite being Canadian, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1908538518919323827">a big booster</a> of Trump, even as the president rolled out the current tariff regime earlier this year. His Elon Musk-lite impression included using the sale of GameStop‚Äôs Canadian operation <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/gamestop-selling-canadian-french-operations-stores-ryan-cohen-wokeness-dei/">to dunk on DEI policies</a>. He‚Äôs currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">using GameStop to buy billions in Bitcoin</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is adding several new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> when it comes to the Switch systems on October 16. We already knew Dragonite was getting one of these powerful alternate forms, and now another monster from the series‚Äô first generation is getting an upgrade almost 30 years later. However, while Dragonite is a long-time favorite from the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>games, Victreebel, the pitcher plant Pok√©mon, is a much more surprising pick.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Victreebel was first teased on Tuesday, August 19, through </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1957790171216158990"><span>a social media post</span></a><span> on the official </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>social channels which showed a hand gripping onto a rusted gate, presumably somewhere in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>‚Äôs Lumiose City where the game takes place. The image looks pretty ominous, and if it weren‚Äôt posted by the official </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>account, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have known it was about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. The text even says ‚ÄúViewer discretion advised,‚Äù probably so parents don‚Äôt show it to their young children. </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>is no stranger to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666"><span>dark stories</span></a><span> in its promo material, and even the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-arceus-ghostly-new-pokemon-belong-to-a-special-1847938579"><span>some pretty spooky shit in its trailers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The video is presented as found footage, showing two unsuspecting characters searching an abandoned building and finding a toxic purple substance and a bunch of scary Pok√©mon. At the end we see Mega Victreebel, whose destructive power scares the humans off. However, its trainer calms it down, and it turns out it‚Äôs not a terrifying monster; it‚Äôs just a goofy guy who doesn‚Äôt know its own strength. The official description on the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel">Pok√©mon website</a> says that it uses its own vines to keep all the acid it accumulates in its body by wrapping them around its throat. Mega Evolutions remain brutal.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Notably, Victreebel and Dragonite were both on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>list of leaked Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> from back in March.
