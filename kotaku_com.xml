            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Much has been said about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> success and the business calls that made it an unexpected frontrunner in the 2025 Game of the Year race. Now we’ve learned that the game was somehow made for less than $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and CEO Guillaume Broche said that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s budget was a tiny fraction of your average AAA game, coming out to “less than $10 million.” To put that into perspective, Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>cost around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233"><span>$300 million</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> managed to avoid those ballooning budgets by aiming for a much smaller scale and refusing to chase the modern open-world bloat that has some games costing huge fortunes and taking half a decade to make.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Broche lays out, Sandfall made a string of creative decisions that would allow the studio to create a lot with fewer resources, a smaller team, and a reasonable budget. One major example is how the game’s overworld is a miniature recreation of a map, rather than a full-blown open-world space. This allowed the devs to present an explorable universe to players without having to create something on the scale of open-world games that show off every detail as players walk through it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>is an independent studio</span></a><span>, but much of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s funding came from publisher Kepler Interactive, and some parts of development (including battle animations and localization) were outsourced. The result is that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> manages to have all the polish of a prestige AAA game at a budget that a lot of other publishers would have you believe can’t possibly produce games of its quality.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s still a false narrative floating around the internet that </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people"><span>only 30 people</span></a><span> made Sandfall Interactive’s breakout debut RPG. While yes, the company itself may be smaller than your average studio, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>was also </span><a href="https://vgbees.com/if-you-dont-count-everyone-else-all-devs-are-solo-devs/"><span>developed in collaboration with contractors</span></a><span>. The numbers don’t lie, though. When blockbuster development costs are ballooning,</span><i><span> Clair Obscur</span></i><span> proves you can make a hit that still looks and feels impressive without breaking the bank.</span></p>

 <p><span>It also, thankfully, is not a massive time sink. I rolled credits at around 30 hours, while most RPGs last at least twice as long. Broche told </span><i><span>The New York Times</span></i><span> he hopes </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s success will help bring the cost of developing AAA games back to a more reasonable range.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We have the tech now to make those games with a relatively small team,” Broche said. “Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early.”</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243"><span>The 2025 Game Awards</span></a><span> are tonight, and </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>has 13 nominations</span></a><span> across multiple categories, which is the most any game has earned in the event’s decade-long history.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-microsd-card-returns-at-0-07-per-gb-expand-storage-on-nintendo-switch-phones-or-tablets-for-almost-nothing-2000652287</link>
            <guid>1379707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="168" data-end="915">Storage has become one of the most frustrating limitations of modern tech. No matter how much space manufacturers promise, it never feels like enough. Our phones eventually fill up with new photos and videos, our PCs balloon with game downloads and media files, and our gaming consoles never seem to have enough room for the next title we want to install. Because of this ongoing struggle, storage deals tend to be some of the best and most reliable purchases you can make. When SSDs, external drives, or microSD cards go on sale, it’s usually smart to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/">Right now, the Samsung EVO Select line of memory cards is discounted by as much as 25%, making it a great time to upgrade your device’s storage without spending much.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 64GB version of the Samsung EVO Select microSD is only&nbsp; $15 at the moment. But what’s this? So is the 128GB version. You can double the storage for no extra charge. Beyond that, the 256GB version is down to $23, and the full 1TB option has dropped from $93 to just $70.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Download More Game to Your Nintendo Switch</h2>
<p>For gamers in particular, especially those who own a Nintendo Switch, a microSD card is practically a necessity. The original Nintendo Switch model launched with only 32GB of internal storage, which disappears remarkably fast once you start downloading games. While Nintendo titles tend to be smaller than the enormous triple-A games common on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—many of which exceed 100GB—Switch games can still add up quickly. For instance, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> weighs in at around 18.2GB, which is more than half of the system’s default storage all by itself. Add a couple more games and your space is gone in an instant.</p>
<p>That’s why ya gotta upgrade. With the Samsung EVO Select 1TB MicroSD card currently available for just $70, you can multiply your Switch storage many, many times over without needing to delete and redownload your favorite titles. 1TB gives you enough room to store a massive library of games, screenshots, captures, and save data, ensuring you’ll never need to stress about running out of space before a big download ever again.</p>



<p>However, if you’re playing on the Nintendo Switch 2, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. These particular microSD cards will not work with the latest Nintendo console. Nintendo’s next-generation console uses the newer microSD Express format, which offers significantly faster read and write speeds. Because of this difference, inserting a Samsung EVO Select MicroSD card into a Switch 2 will be met with nothing but an incompatibility message. Or maybe just nothing at all, I haven’t personally tested it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EVO Select cards remain fully functional with the former lineup of Nintendo systems: the original Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, and the Switch OLED model.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the Samsung EVO Select series delivers read and write speeds up to 160MB/s. While that doesn’t meet the more demanding requirements of the Switch 2, it exceeds what’s needed for the original Switch family, which only recommends speeds up to 90MB/s. In practical terms, this means smooth loading times and reliable performance for everything you play. Unless you’re playing a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>game because nothing can help those perform well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Goes Into Full Clearance Mode on Its Soundbar as the S100F With Bass Reflex Speaker Hits an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-into-full-clearance-mode-on-its-soundbar-as-the-s100f-with-bass-reflex-speaker-hits-an-all-time-low-2000652293</link>

              <p>You can’t really enjoy an immersive viewing experience without great sound to match the visuals. If you’re looking to make holiday movie nights better but your current TV doesn’t have solid built-in speakers, adding a soundbar to the setup can be a smart move. And thanks to Amazon, picking one up doesn’t break the bank today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony S100F 2.0ch soundbar is currently going for just $98 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 39% off its usual price of $160</a>. Shipping is free as well, so you’re not adding anything on top of the sale price. Even better, orders placed today will arrive before Christmas, so you can have fun streaming marathons with friends and family with fuller, richer audio that fills the room. Note that it’s only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab yours before the offer expires.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Surround Sound Experience</h2>
<p>The slim design blends into every entertainment setup well, matching the aesthetics of any room. You can place it on your console right below the screen, or mount it on the wall if you prefer a cleaner setup. It punches well above its weight, though. Sony has packed the soundbar with a two-speaker setup that delivers front surround sound by handling the full audio range without requiring additional subwoofers or speakers. It produces audio as a stereo mix for a wider soundstage that fills the entire room, instead of just blasting from the front.</p>
<p>The bass reflex speaker does an incredible job of delivering punchy, deep bass without compromising on the details, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. You will be able to vibe to all your favorite tunes, plus immerse yourself in thrilling scenes like never before. S-Force Pro, on the other hand, emulates cinema-style sound fields for better clarity and a 3D experience. Translation? Cars in F1 race past your couch, gunfire erupts right in your living room, and the Grinch’s footsteps feel like they’re actually coming from behind you. Whether you’re planning to watch an action-packed series or stream some good old Christmas title, it makes you feel a part of what’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>There’s a voice enhancement feature that automatically improves dialog clarity, even in those loud, chaotic scenes. It also comes in handy when you’re catching up with friends on a bigger screen; you will be able to hear everyone on the conference call clearly. Connectivity couldn’t be easier. A single HDMI ARC connection between the TV and the soundbar gets the party started. You can control both the TV and the soundbar with a single remote. Best of all, it supports Bluetooth connections just as well, which is great for when you want to pair your smartphone wirelessly with it. Maybe play some songs or a podcast in the background as you set holiday decorations up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">On a regular day, this speaker would run you around $160, but this deal lets you grab it for $98, which is quite affordable considering all the features it gets you.</a> If you’ve been after better sound, this soundbar can be an excellent addition to your setup. Snap it up quick, though, as the discount is a limited-time one. The retailer hasn’t specified an end date, but we’re not expecting it to last long. Placing your orders now will also allow you to get it before Christmas!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Ray-Ban (Gen 1) Gets Cleared Out for Less Than Regular Sunglasses, Even Though They’re Smart AI Glasses]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-ray-ban-gen-1-gets-cleared-out-for-less-than-regular-sunglasses-even-though-theyre-smart-ai-glasses-2000652301</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses have been cool all the way back to Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison in the ’50s, and now 7 decades later, they’re getting a whole new life as advanced tech wearables thanks to Meta. These retro-cool glasses are now 21st Century marvels with speakers, camera, mic, and Meta AI all discreetly built in, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">they’re also a great limited-time deal at Amazon right now for just $224.</a></p>
<p>There are 10 different models of the Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers available as part of this limited-time deal, in regular and large sizes for men and women, with a variety of frame colors and lenses ranging from clear to transitions to different shades and colors of sunglasses. They’re the top-selling AI glasses in the world, and now you can find out why for $75 less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Tech, But With Style</h2>
<p>Futuristic tech mixed with impeccable classic style is the mashup we need right now, so seeing Meta team up with Ray-Ban rather than create some bizarre-looking goggles or helmet or other such thing is a hugely welcome development. The Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers looks like the regular Wayfarers made legendary by Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise in <em>Risky Business</em>, and the Blues Brothers, but these also take seriously good 12MP photos and 1080p video, which is probably why&nbsp;<em>Popular Mechanics</em> calls them the best AI glasses for social media. To engage the camera, just touch a button on the glasses’ arm, or use a voice command.</p>
<p>(Side note: While the Wayfarers spiked again in popularity when&nbsp;<em>The Blues Brothers</em> came out in 1980, there’s an ongoing debate about whether they both wore Wayfarers, or if Dan Aykroyd’s Elwood actually wore lookalike vintage sunglasses. Either way, they’re indelibly associated with the Wayfarers.)</p>
<p>The Meta AI features are probably the most mindblowing of all. The multimodal AI can translate signs, identify objects, and even look up and give you historical information on something you’re looking at, in real time. It’s all done discreetly — you gain all of the information while to the rest of the world, you’re just a person in Wayfarers. Real-time audio translations from 6 languages and counting are built in, with no Wi-Fi connection necessary.</p>



<h2>Outstanding Audio</h2>
<p>Even without any actual in-ear extension, the custom-built open-ear speakers sound amazing during calls or if you’re listening to music or a podcast. You get immersive sound that doesn’t intrude on the people standing near you, and you can call and text hands-free. The incredible amount of interactivity provided by the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers make them a content creator’s dream, a multitasker’s must-have, and they just look&nbsp;<em>cool</em> no matter which feature you’re using (or none.)</p>
<p>The opportunity to look like James Dean but have hidden tech worthy of James Bond is worth a heck of lot more than just $224, but that’s the Amazon price tag on the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers during this limited-time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">Save 25% and grab one of the best and coolest tech wearables available anywhere.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP 17″ Ryzen 5 Laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) Crashes Nearly 70%, With $199 Worth of Accessories Included for Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-ryzen-5-laptop-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-crashes-nearly-70-with-199-worth-of-accessories-included-for-christmas-2000652297</link>

              <p>Laptop upgrades can cost a pretty penny, depending on the features you’re after. If you’re a work professional or a student looking to upgrade their everyday machine, you need a model with a good display, a comfortable keyboard, a muscular processor, plus at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Most options offering these and more – especially the ones from known brands – sit well over $1,200, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/">We just spotted the 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop going for just $1,000 at Amazon, after the retailer generously took a whopping 67% off its usual $3,000 tag.</a> Orders placed within a couple of days arrive before Christmas, so you can also consider it as a gift for a loved one. Best of all, the retailer throws in a bunch of useful computer accessories worth almost $200 with your purchase – for absolutely nothing. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter to score the discount or the freebies. Just add the item to your cart, and the offers apply automatically. You’ll also save an additional 5% at checkout, which ultimately brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, discounts this good don’t stick around for long. It’s best to hurry to grab yours, as the price could shoot back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Work and Play Performance</h2>
<p>The roomy 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) display offers plenty of space to work and play without feeling limited. It not only pushes vibrant, detailed visuals, but also features an anti-glare coating that makes the overall viewing experience quite comfortable on the eyes. Whether you’re using it out there in the sun or while sitting in a dimly lit room, picture quality stays consistent and balanced. Touch support makes navigation easy. You won’t have to rely on the keypad or the mouse to find your way around things; just use your fingers directly on the screen to pinch, tap, scroll, draw, and even type. Paired with the screen is a spacious, full-sized backlit keyboard. It makes typing long documents easy on the wrists, while the backlight lets you hit goals even after the shadows fall.</p>



<p>The laptop runs on the AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.3GHz. It’s powerful enough to support you through all your tasks, from those early-morning deadlines to late-night passion projects. There’s a massive 32GB RAM to keep everything (video calls, resource-intensive applications, games) running smoothly; something that makes a huge difference during busy days when you need to handle a bunch of tasks at the same time. The 1TB SSD lets you store all your important files in a single place. You can throw in a ton of videos, high-resolution photos, work documents, research files, and more with ease. Even better, the memory and storage are expandable up to <strong>64GB RAM and 2TB SSD</strong>, respectively, so you can always add more as your needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, thanks to HP Fast Charge that juices the laptop from 0 to 50% in just about 45 minutes. Plug it in during a quick lunch break at work, and come back to a machine ready to help you power through the rest of your day.</p>
<p>The accessory kit includes a Redragon mouse, an external CD/DVD drive, and a clean cloth. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> also comes pre-installed, so you’re literally getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>
