              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-steam-eshop-crashing-twitch-game-pass-hollow-knight-2000623137">may have crashed Steam, PSN, and the Switch eStore with its launch</a>, but that doesn’t seem to have hurt its success any once they all crawled back online. Team Cherry’s enormously anticipated Metroidvania sequel has just reached over half a million concurrent players on Steam alone. That’s a figure that doesn’t include Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch numbers, nor indeed PC players who bought the game on GOG or elsewhere, or who are playing it via Game Pass. It’s fair to say things are going pretty well.</p> <p>At around 10.30 ET this morning, September 4, <em>Kotaku</em> team members began dropping&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s concurrent player numbers as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">compiled by&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em></a> into the Slack. 156,271 was the first big number to astonish us. The original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>‘s all-time peak was 72,916, and even that was set only yesterday. On release in 2017, it was lucky to see just a thousand, its popularity building up to a big August 2018 spike of 10,000 concurrent players. It took until May 2022 to find 20,000, and only hit those numbers again last month after the announcement of the release date for the long-delayed sequel. I explain all this because it’s fairly important context when looking at the hundreds of thousands who have shown up for <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>By 12.30 today, that number had reached 245,587, and it seemed like it might be time to write about hitting a quarter of a million. But the number kept going up. At 1 p.m. it was 382,195, and just six minutes later had risen to over 400,000. At 1.30, 478k, and then at 2 p.m. it reached a ridiculous 534,450. That makes it the game with the 18th highest number of concurrent players on Steam, <em>ever</em>. It just beat the hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>beta weekend into 19th. That, let’s not forget, was a&nbsp;<em>free</em> weekend with a multiplayer game—this is a 2D single-player platformer.</p>

 <p>Of course, a large part of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s launch day success is the extraordinary build-up and anticipation it’s received. Absent from industry showcases for years on end, its potential audience became almost cult-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028">as it endured the long stretch of silence</a>. The original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>was much more of a sleeper hit, slowly building its audience and reputation, hence lacking any headline spike at any point over the last eight years. It’ll be interesting to see how long <em>Silksong</em> can maintain this momentum, as people get over the sense of disbelief that it actually really exists and is finally here. The number has started dropping for the first time all day as I’ve written this, just by five thousand or so, but it suggests it’s calming down for the moment. Of course, this could start climbing again once the U.S. workforce that <em>didn’t</em> book the day off are released home to reach their computers and consoles.</p> <p>In the meantime, it strongly suggests that Team Cherry were <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785">very wise to pick the price point that surprised so many</a>. Yes, the game could absolutely have sold incredibly well at $60, based on reputation alone, but going for $20 vastly increases the potential audience who will pay right now, rather than waiting six months for a 90 percent off Steam sale. Given the half a million people simultaneously playing on Steam likely only represents a fraction of those who will have bought the game today, this will be a massive financial success. And we’re just talking about <em>today’s</em> sales.</p> <p>Whether the game’s actually good or not? That, rather intriguingly, is something everyone’s finding out simultaneously today, given no review code was supplied to press. The lines who played a brief demo at Gamescom had an inkling, but it’ll be tomorrow before consensus begins to appear.</p>

              <p><em>Puzzle Quest</em>, the match-3 RPG that invented the genre and arguably defines it to this day, is finally receiving the love and care it deserves. For the first time, the game—along with its many additions—is getting a remaster, boosted to HD, and released to run properly on your personal favorite gaming platform. Even better, it’s out as soon as September 18!</p> <p>In 2007, when Steam was just a tiny baby, a match-3 RPG sprang out of nowhere.&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, by developers Infinite Interactive, casually invented an entire new genre, and immediately did it better than anyone else ever would. It was an early smash hit on Steam, walking through the door PopCap had opened just months earlier with&nbsp;<em>Peggle</em>. And wow, it was great.</p> <p>Of course match-3 games were already a big deal. PopCap’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> had taken care of that years earlier, following the path from <em>Tetris</em> to&nbsp;<em>Dr. Mario</em> to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Bobble</em>. 1994 Russian DOS game <em>Shariki</em> takes the title of the first true match-3 game, but it was 2001’s&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em> that brought the concept into the mainstream, followed by the likes of the blissfully wonderful&nbsp;<em>Zoo Keeper</em> on DS in 2003. So by 2007, still long before King’s <em>Candy Crush Saga</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-play-instead-of-candy-crush-saga">would ruin&nbsp;everything</a> with its free-to-play shenanigans, a billion&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled&nbsp;</em>clones meant match-3 was everywhere. It only took a genius to say, “Yes, but what if it were an RPG?”</p>

 <p>That’s&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, where the matching of the three becomes an aggressive act, used to attack your computer opponent with spells and wallops, while collecting treasure and just generally feeling a zen marvelousness. In between each match, you moved around a properly RPG-like map, talked to <em>D&amp;D</em>-like characters, and were told a story that gave meaning and purpose to your puzzling. This was largely thanks to the <em>Warlords</em> setting, introduced in 1989 with the eponymous <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6845/warlords/"><em>Warlords</em></a> which was created by <em>Puzzle Quest </em>lead Steve Fawkner. These elements together made <em>Puzzle Quest </em>something splendid, and best of all, it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12500/PuzzleQuest_Challenge_of_the_Warlords/">can still be bought and played today</a>. (Should Steam ever recover from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, anyway.) But man, it looks like a stray dog some 18 years later, which is why I’m so damned delighted about the reveal of&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em>.</p>  <p>This new revision includes the game’s 2008 expansion <em>Revenge of the Plague Lords</em>, as well as the new content that was created for the 2019 Switch port,&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: The Legend Returns</em>. On top of that, there’s a new class being added, and the mysterious addition of “much more.” And gosh, it looks so shiny and new, and yet as wonderfully cluttered as it always was. This is being developed by Infinity Plus Two, the rebrand of the original Infinity Interactive that appeared in 2019, presumably with Steve Fawkner still at the helm.</p>

 <p>Best of all, this is proper old-fashioned match-3 gaming, without all the microtransaction bullshit and ad-fueled misery that dominates the genre today. Infinity also created the extraordinary&nbsp;<em>Gems of War</em>, a live-service re-imagining of the same format that’s still receiving huge updates and new content ten years after its launch. My 10-year-old recently became astonishingly obsessed with it, and plays at a level I cannot fathom, but that comes with the constant disappointment of my refusing to pay for all three of its simultaneous battle passes every month, let alone the eight trillion “offers” it pops up with as you’re playing. (I do pay for one battle pass, I’m not a monster.)</p> <p>Of course&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> went on to receive its own sequels, including numbered follow-ups&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3 </em>and&nbsp;a sci-fi version called <em>Puzzle Quest: Galactrix</em>, as well as the F2P-riddled <em>Marvel Puzzle Quest</em> developed by Demiurge Studios. There was even a&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</em>, although I admit I’d never heard of that one until researching for this article. It’d be lovely to see&nbsp;<em>PQ 2 </em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Galactrix</em> getting the same treatment soon. Let’s hope this first game’s rebirth is enough of a success. It’s coming out on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and X/S, Switch and PC (no word on a mobile version yet), so there are plenty of ways to play it come September 18.</p>
