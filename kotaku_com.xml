              <p>Four years after its release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s Steam Deck</a> is still the most popular handheld PC around and for good reason. The portable gaming device is easy to use, can play most 2D games you install on it with ease, handles 3D games fairly well, and can even be modded and tweaked if you so desire. It’s a marvelous machine, and if you are here, you likely own one or are about to buy one and want some video game recommendations. Thankfully, you’ve come to the right list, my friend.</p> <p>Below you’ll find the 15 best PC games to play on your <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-nintendo-switch-performance-pc-emulation-1849827018">Steam Deck</a>. For this list, we tried to include a mix of “classic” Steam Deck games—yes,<em> Vampire Survivors</em> is on here—as well as some titles that don’t always get mentioned when talking about the system. This list also features some bigger games as well as experiences that might be perfect for killing time at a bus stop or a short train ride. Lastly, for this list, we tried to stick to games that run well on the Deck without having to make weird tweaks or install mods.</p>

 <p>Hopefully, at least one of these games is what you were looking for and lets you enjoy your Steam Deck a little more.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em></h2>  <p>Any list of best Steam Deck games is legally obligated to include <em>Vampire Survivors.</em> At this point, Valve should just pay Poncle some amount of money to have <em>Vampire Survivors</em> pre-installed on all Steam Decks. Anyway, yeah, it’s cheap, fun, runs great, and is a perfect game for the Steam Deck. I’d say play it, but you likely already have.</p>

 <h2><em>Stardew Valley</em></h2>  <p>Another “legally obligated” recommendation, but hey, <em>Stardew Valley</em> is great, and it runs like a dream on Steam Deck. And if you want to get wild, unlike the Switch port of this popular cozy slice of life farming sim, <em>Stardew Valley</em> on Steam Deck can be modded. You don’t need to do that to play it, to be clear, but if you want to, it is an option on Deck.</p>

 <h2><em>Balatro</em></h2>  <p>Okay, last one of these “legally obligated” entries, but yes, <em>Balatro</em> is an incredible game. One of the best games released in the last few years. Playing this strange poker rogue-like with bizarre joker cards is a blast regardless of where you play. On Steam Deck, <em>Balatro</em> is a treat, won’t kill your battery, and takes up little room. A no-brainer to toss on your Deck.</p> <h2><em>Dave the Diver</em></h2>  <p>Some of the best games for the Steam Deck are ones built around “runs.” Games built like this let you hop in for a bit, then put the console to sleep when your bus arrives or your meeting starts. <em>Dave the Diver,</em> being split into different days, makes it one of these perfect Steam Deck games. Also helping is <em>Dave the Diver</em>‘s 2D art style which the Deck can handle without breaking a sweat. It’s never been easier to catch and cook digital fish on the go.</p>

 <h2><em>Blue Prince</em></h2>  <p>Someone told me this was their Steam Deck bedtime game, and I get it. Slowly exploring a cozy but mysterious mansion that shifts every time you visit and is filled with puzzles to solve is a perfect activity to engage in for a bit before calling it a night. <em>Blue Prince</em>‘s 3D visuals don’t push the Steam Deck hard, and it plays effortlessly on a gamepad, making this a fantastic way to play one of 2025’s best-reviewed games.</p> <h2><em>Dredge</em></h2>  <p>For those looking for something creepy to play on their Steam Deck, but not interested in a really scary game, <em>Dredge</em> is a great option. Not only does <em>Dredge</em> run well on the Deck, but it’s yet another game divided up into days, letting you jump in for a bit of fishing in its unsettling waters without making you commit to hours of cutscenes and action. Perfect for a lunch break run or a quick bit of game time on the toilet. Look, I’m not here to judge where or how you use the Deck, okay?</p> <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></h2>  <p>You could probably fill up a Steam Deck with nothing but a ton of auto-shooter games that play a lot like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. (In fact, there’s one more coming up on this list.) But among&nbsp;the many, many games that followed in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>‘ wake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deep-rock-galactic-survival-vampire-survivors-roguelike-1851276484"><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></a> is one of the best. Adding sci-fi dwarves and mining and sub-challenges to the formula helps elevate this one beyond a mere clone. It runs well on Deck, too, though its 3D visuals will eat up battery faster than <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Hades / Hades 2</em></h2>  <p>At one point, this list contained separate entries for <em>Hades</em> and its 2025 sequel. Then the list just had one, but mentioned the other. Let’s just save some time and internet ink and combine them into one entry. Both <em>Hades</em> games are impeccably designed action roguelikes that feature hot Greek gods, plenty of action, and gorgeous visuals that look like the coolest animated movie ever.&nbsp; And both <em>Hades</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064"><em>Hades 2</em></a> play like a dream on Steam Deck. You really can’t go wrong with your choice.</p> <h2><em>Sektori</em></h2>  <p><em>Geometry Wars</em> was a good game. What if someone made a new one? Well, they did, and it’s called <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-twin-stick-shooter-is-the-new-geometry-wars-and-it-rules-2000650227"><em>Sektori</em>, and it’s awesome</a> on any platform you play it on. And that includes the Steam Deck, where <em>Sektori</em> looks and runs flawlessly while delivering fast and fluid twin-stick shooter fun. You can’t ask for much more for $15.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-valve-pc-steam-deck-namco-bandai-stuttering-1848664299">When <em>Elden Ring</em> first arrived back in 2022</a>, the Steam Deck ended up being one of the best places to play FromSoftware’s hit open-world RPG. Flash forward to today, and it’s still a damn fine way to enjoy <em>Elden Ring.</em> It might not look as crisp as it will on a PS5 or a high-end PC, and it will eat your battery up quickly, but that’s all worth it to have such a fantastic game playable anywhere.</p> <h2><em>Resident Evil 2</em></h2>  <p>A surprising number of modern <em>Resident Evil</em> games run well on the Steam Deck, but I still think the remake of <em>Resident Evil 2</em> might be the best one to play on Valve’s portable PC. It’s not too big, doesn’t push the system too hard, and is a great installment in the franchise. It might not be as easy to drop in and out of this game as others on the list, but <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is still a great choice to play on the Deck. Just maybe leave the lights on?</p> <h2><em>Big Hops</em></h2>  <p>Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-could-learn-something-from-this-incredible-3d-platformer-2000660289"><em>Big Hop</em>s</a> was just released in January, but that doesn’t change the fact that this 3D platformer heavily inspired by <em>Mario</em> deserves a place on this list. Not only because it’s a joyful and creative platformer about a frog with a very useful tongue, but also because it looks sharp as heck and runs perfectly at 60FPS on the Deck. The world needs more fun 3D platformers, and <em>Big Hops</em> is here to answer that call.</p>

 <h2><em>Warframe</em></h2>  <p>For a few different reasons, there aren’t many big live-service online games available for the Steam Deck. So, free-to-play ninja shooter <em>Warframe</em> being fully playable on the device is very cool. If you’ve always wanted to slice up robots and aliens while running 70MPH in a cyber ninja suit, this is the game for you. And you can do all of that and more while killing time at the airport, assuming you have a solid wi-fi connection, as <em>Warframe</em> is an online-only game.</p> <h2><em>TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</em></h2>  <p>A 2D pixel art brawler is just about the perfect video game for the Steam Deck, and <em>TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</em> is one of the best you can find on Steam. So of course we added it to this list. And for those of you going “But this is better with other people!” don’t worry. You can just connect multiple gamepads to the Steam Deck and do some portable brawlin’ with pals wherever you want. Or connect your Steam Deck to a TV and enjoy one of the best <em>TMNT</em> games ever made.</p> <h2><em>Megabonk</em></h2>  <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;but 3D and weirder is the elevator pitch for <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591"><em>Megabonk</em></a>. And it might be one of the best things to play on a Steam Deck. Even when the hordes of enemies get massive, the game’s framerate stays steady, and it feels perfect to play on a gamepad. The world doesn’t need many more auto-shooters, but it’s nice that we got one more that’s as good and fun as <em>Megabonk</em>. And it’s just $10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you read <em>Kotaku</em> even semi-regularly, you already know that Xbox has been in a weird spot for some time now. And with today’s news that both <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">Xbox boss Phil Spencer and President Sarah Bond are leaving</a> and the new head of the brand will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">a former Meta exec who previously lead Microsoft’s AI division</a>, I think it’s time to call it. Xbox is dead. Time of death: February 20, 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911">This death is far from sudden or surprising</a>. If anything, we’ve all seen it coming for a while now. Reading the news about Xbox often felt like checking in on someone battling a terminal disease and whose fight wasn’t going well. Looking at the endless layoffs, impossible demands from leadership, canceled projects, flops, games getting ported to PlayStation, and loads of mismanagement, it seemed clear that in recent years, Xbox wasn’t doing well.</p>

 <h2>The beginning of the end</h2> <p>If I had to pick the moment when things truly got bad, it would be when <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-xbox-merger-timeline-call-of-duty-1850108022">Xbox bought Activision Blizzard</a>. After spending $70 billion and enduring years of legal challenges to its efforts to buy the <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Warcraft</em> publisher, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-finally-completes-activision-blizzard-deal-1850924662">Xbox finally pulled it off in 2023.</a> But suddenly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Xbox found itself under much more pressure to deliver</a>. Xbox was no longer just a console created by Microsoft as a small side hustle; instead it had morphed into a massive publisher with a huge suite of studios, franchises, and employees to manage. Over the next two years, everything started to change at Xbox.</p> <p>The company began de-emphasizing the idea that you even needed to own an Xbox to play Xbox games. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox, remember?</a> Want to play <em>Halo</em> or <em>Gears of War</em> but don’t own an Xbox? Don’t worry, the games are launching on PC. Don’t want to play on PC? It’s fine, you can stream them via your phone or TV. You don’t even have to buy the games, just pay for this monthly subscription. When a console brand stops trying to sell consoles, you can probably stick a fork in it.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">We here at <em>Kotaku</em> called the end of the console war around this time.</a> But we didn’t call the death of the Xbox just then. That’s because, despite all the signs, there was always that chance that Phil Spencer would right the ship again, as he had done before, and keep Xbox alive.</p>

 <h2>AI and porting <em>Halo</em></h2> <p>And then Microsoft, like all big tech giants these days, began investing even more billions of dollars into AI. And here was Xbox, a pricey side project that never made the company much money, but was costing the company a ton on massive deals to buy Bethesda and Activision. That was cash that could be spent on datacenters and Copilot, damn it!</p> <p>This is around the time that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">Microsoft began trying to shove AI into Xbox</a> in a very awkward fashion, one that felt removed from Spencer’s stewardship of the brand. In 2025, after already porting some of its smaller games, like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>and <em>Grounded</em>, to PlayStation and Switch, Xbox did the unthinkable. <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">It announced plans to bring <em>Halo</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, yet one more big sign that it was all over. Spencer would never promote this news on social media.</p>

 <p>That brings us to today. Xbox will no longer be run by a “gamer.” Instead, Asha Sharma, an AI executive who previously worked at Meta and InstaCart and who has no video game industry experience at all, has been put in charge of the brand despite another person, Sarah Bond, being seemingly the perfect successor to Spencer. Sharma’s hiring has generated a lot of speculation, with some theorizing that she’s a temp pick until Microsoft completely devours Xbox and turns it into nothing more than an icon on your desktop that you never click. Others have suggested she’s been put in place to help bring AI to Xbox in a big way, which seems very likely, too.</p> <p>Regardless of why she’s been made the new Xbox boss, it is now very clear: Xbox is dead. The corpse will linger around for a bit longer, but the odds of a new Xbox console hitting shelves are low. I suspect all future hardware will be rebranded PCs, like the ROG Ally X handheld from last year. A slow death for a console that once was huge, but was sunk by tech executives who had no idea what they were doing.</p>
