            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fact that this <strong>Asus ROG Strix 27-inch OLED gaming monitor</strong> has never been on sale before makes<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/"> this Black Friday drop to an all-time low of $549 (down from $699) on Amazon a big deal</a>. Asus usually sticks to its guns with MSRP on premium ROG monitors but Amazon’s opening day of Black Friday saw deep cuts across the board on everything from the larger 32 and 34-inch models that also reached new all-time lows.</p>
<p>Gaming monitors solve the fundamental problem of seeing what you’re shooting at before your opponent does, and OLED panels take that advantage to another level with instant pixel response and infinite contrast. The ROG Strix XG27AQDMG combines <strong>1440p resolution with 240Hz refresh rate and true 0.03ms response time</strong> in a package that makes everything else look washed out and sluggish.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED Technology Perfect for Gaming Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>26.5-inch WOLED panel offers a resolution of 2560 by 1440</strong>&nbsp;which hits a sweet spot between the lack of detail in 1080p and the demanding GPU of 4K. Third-generation WOLED technology results in brighter white windows and clearer text compared to previous generations of OLED that struggled with full-screen brightness. Each pixel emits its own light and turns fully off for true blacks, creating infinite contrast that makes dark scenes in games actually visible instead of turning into grey mush. The glossy coating maximizes color vibrancy and eliminates the haze that matte coatings introduce, though it does require some attention to room lighting to avoid reflections. The <strong>99% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage</strong> means colors look saturated and accurate without the oversaturation that cheap gaming monitors produce.</p>



<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms grey-to-grey response time</strong> eliminates the ghosting and motion blur that plagues slower panels. Your mouse cursor moves across the screen with zero trailing, and fast-paced shooters clearly display enemy movement without smearing, while racing games show track details even at high speeds. This combination of high refresh rate and instant pixel response creates the motion clarity that competitive gamers need to track targets accurately.</p>



<p>ROG’s exclusive OLED Anti-flicker technology <strong>reduces flicker during refresh rate fluctuations</strong> that can cause eye strain during extended gaming sessions. Conventionally, variable refresh rate displays would usually flicker when frame rates change rapidly, but Asus worked out algorithms that would smooth these transitions. The technology works invisibly behind the scenes, maintaining consistent image quality whether you’re getting 240fps or dropping to 120fps during intensive scenes.</p>
<p>Included in the purchase price is <strong>three months of Adobe Creative Cloud access</strong>&nbsp;which adds value if you do any photo editing, graphic design, or video work. The OLED’s perfect blacks and wide color gamut make it excellent for creative work beyond gaming, as it’s able to accurately display the full range of colors that content creators need to see. The 1440p resolution provides enough screen real estate for editing timelines or working with multiple windows without feeling cramped.</p>
<p>At $549, this is the first discount ever on the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG and brings OLED gaming down to prices that previously only got you mid-tier IPS panels. You’re getting third-generation WOLED technology with burn-in protections, 240Hz refresh and instant response times for $150 less than Asus’s asking price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-heros-rival-this-dji-4k-120fps-camera-is-going-for-pocket-change-at-black-friday-2000645668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-hero%E2%80%99s-rival-this-dji-4k-120fps-camera-is-going-for-pocket-change-this-black-friday.1359067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GoPro should be looking over its shoulder because DJI has been closing the gap fast in the action camera market over the past few years. The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro</strong> goes head-to-head with GoPro’s latest Hero13 Black, and in several areas, it actually pulls ahead. This Black Friday deal on Amazon drops the <em>Essential combo</em> to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">a record low of $259, down from the usual $339</a>, which undercuts GoPro’s flagship by a decent margin.</p>
<p>Action cameras capture moments your phone can’t handle like mountain biking through trails, surfing big waves, or documenting motorcycle rides where stabilization and durability matter more than megapixels. DJI packed this camera with a massive sensor, advanced stabilization, and dual touchscreens that make it easier to use than the competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Sensor That Handles Low Light</h2>
<p>The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro features a 1/1.3-inch sensor</strong>, considerably larger than you’d find in most action cameras. It features 2.4-micrometer pixels that pull in more light per pixel to give you usable footage in conditions where other action cameras produce grainy messes. The 13.5-stop dynamic range means you can shoot into bright skies without losing detail in shadows or capture sunset scenes without blowing out the highlights. <strong>DJI’s processing handles 4K video at 120fps</strong> which gives you buttery slow-motion playback to analyze your technique or create dramatic highlight reels. In quick-changing lighting conditions such as moving between shaded forest trails and sunny clearings, this sensor does an excellent job of maintaining consistent exposure.</p>



<p>Subject tracking that actually works in the real world is powered by an advanced 4nm chip. You can set the <strong>camera to track yourself, friends, or even pets</strong> while <strong>shooting in either 16:9 or vertical 9:16 aspect ratios</strong>. Its tracking stays locked on moving subjects with remarkable accuracy, removing that perpetual anxiety of whether I am staying in frame or not. This feature transforms solo content creation because you simply don’t need someone behind the camera following you around.</p>
<p><strong>Voice control</strong> remains on and ready for response within about a meter radius so you can start recording, shoot photos, or stop recording from a distance without touching the camera. This makes sense when you’re skiing, climbing, or doing anything where reaching for buttons breaks your flow. Recognition accuracy handles commands reliably even in moderately noisy environments, though strong winds or loud motors can sometimes throw it off.</p>



<p>The <strong>dual OLED touchscreens on front and back</strong> eradicate that usual action camera frustration: composing shots blind. The front screen means you can frame yourself perfectly for vlogs or selfie shots without having to guess where you’re positioned. Both screens stay bright and readable in direct sunlight, which matters enormously when you try to adjust settings on a sunny beach or snowy mountain. The <strong>touchscreen interface responds quickly and logically,</strong> and makes adjustments of parameters feel natural rather than something you have to commit to memory, along with button combinations.</p>
<p>DJI’s 360° <em>HorizonSteady</em> <strong>stabilization keeps your horizon straight</strong>, no matter how much the camera rotates on the roll axis. You can mount this on your chest, helmet, or handlebars and get footage that’s like it was coming from a gimbal. The stabilization algorithm compensates for sudden jolts, vibrations, and continuous movement while maintaining natural-looking motion.</p>
<p>The 1950mAh battery provides <strong>up to four hours of continuous recording</strong> in normal conditions and impressively keeps 3.6 hours even at negative 20 degrees Celsius. That kind of cold-weather performance puts it ahead of most action cameras, which start dying quickly in freezing temperatures. The <strong>IP68 rating</strong> certifies the camera for depths up to 20 meters without any additional housing, so you can take it snorkeling, surfing, or kayaking without worry.</p>
<p>This Black Friday price of $259 makes the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro substantially cheaper than GoPro’s Hero13 Black with comparable or superior features in several key areas. The larger sensor alone justifies the purchase for anyone who shoots in challenging lighting conditions and the dual OLED screens eliminate the composition guesswork that plagues single-screen action cameras.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-get-fooled-by-apples-official-charger-anker-20w-charger-costs-6x-less-and-works-just-as-well-2000645688</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-get-fooled-by-apple%E2%80%99s-official-charger-anker-20w-charger-costs-6x-less-and-works-just-as-well.1359040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple charges <strong>$19 for its official 20W USB-C charger with no cable included</strong> which makes this 2-pack look absolutely insane in comparison. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">Black Friday bundle on Amazon drops to an all-time low of $11 from the usual $18</a> and includes <strong>two 20W Anker chargers (and two ports on each) plus two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong>. You’re getting everything you need to fast charge two devices for less than what Apple charges for a single bare charger.</p>
<p>Anker earned its reputation by making products for charging that match or exceed official manufacturer specifications while costing a good deal less. The fact that Apple sells Anker products in their own retail stores tells you everything about the quality and reliability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Matches Apple’s Specs</h2>
<p>The<strong> 20W output provides the fastest charging speed available for the iPhone 15/16/17 series phones</strong> over USB-C Power Delivery. Your phone charges from zero to 50% in about 30 minutes which also happens to be exactly what you get from an Apple-issued charger. The charging speed behaves the same across all supported devices including iPads and even Samsung Galaxy phones, or whatever device utilizes USB-C PD charging. Anker uses the same charging protocols that Apple has put in place, so your device cannot tell any difference between this charger and an official Apple unit.</p>



<p>Each of <strong>these chargers includes both a USB-C and a USB-A port</strong> which work simultaneously for charging up to two devices from a single wall outlet. The dual-port design lets you fast-charge your iPhone via USB-C while topping up your AirPods or Apple Watch via the USB-A port. Both ports remain active at the same time without reducing charging speed on either device, eliminating the frustration of choosing which device charges first.</p>



<p>This compact form factor measures in smaller than Apple’s official charger while it outputs the same amount of power. Anker managed to shrink the size by using more efficient component layout and modern charging circuitry. When stored in bags or pockets, the folding prongs keep the profile slim, flipping out with ease when you need to plug in. It features a black finish that looks professional and fits well with most devices and surroundings.</p>
<p>The Anker <em>MultiProtect</em> safety system offers <strong>overvoltage protection, temperature control, current regulation, and short-circuit prevention</strong>. The safety features continuously monitor charging and automatically shut down in the event of an anomaly. Temperature control prevents overheating in case of long use, thus protecting both the charger and your devices. The overvoltage protection means that your devices never get more power than they can safely handle to avoid voltage spikes that result in battery damage.</p>
<p>The<strong> 18-month warranty is a back-up assurance for Anker’s confidence</strong>, and their customer service responds promptly to issues without requiring proof of receipts for purchases or complicated return processes.</p>
<p>For $11, this Black Friday bundle is less expensive than an individual official Apple charger without any cable. You get certified charging gear from a brand in good enough standing for Apple to sell the products in their own stores, including the same degree of safety and build quality as the official option.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-a-ps5-or-gaming-pc-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-and-pedals-is-now-selling-for-pennies-2000645663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-a-ps5-or-gaming-pc-logitech-g29-racing-wheel-and-pedals-is-now-selling-for-pennies.1359037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Racing games with a controller are like driving with oven mitts on and the <strong>Logitech G29</strong> just<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/"> dropped to its lowest price ever at $229 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $329</a>. This bundle<strong> includes the wheel and floor pedals</strong> which turns Gran Turismo, Forza, or F1 games from arcade button-mashing into something that feels like piloting a car.</p>
<p>The G29 has been the entry point into sim racing for years because it delivers<strong> force feedback and build quality</strong> that punches way above its price point. You get real resistance through the wheel, actual brake pressure sensitivity and paddle shifters that click with satisfying precision. Playing racing games without a wheel setup is like playing guitar on a keyboard, technically possible but completely missing the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Force Feedback That Means Something</h2>
<p>The G29 uses<strong> dual-motor force feedback to simulate road conditions</strong>, tire grip, and understeer through the wheel itself. You feel the wheels lose traction before you see it on screen, which gives you that split-second warning to correct your line. The helical gearing inside keeps operation smooth and relatively quiet compared to older gear-driven wheels that sounded like angry washing machines. When you clip a curb in Assetto Corsa or hit gravel in Dirt Rally, the wheel kicks back in your hands exactly like it would in a real car.</p>



<p>The <strong>900-degree rotation means you can turn the wheel two and a half times</strong> from lock to lock, just like an actual F1 car. Most racing titles automatically adjust for this range, meaning you get accurate steering ratios that are in line with what professional drivers actually experience. You can catch slides by feeding in opposite lock, make smooth wide turns with hand-over-hand steering, and feel the difference between car types based on their specific steering characteristics. Games with proper wheel support, like iRacing, ACC, or Gran Turismo 7, truly come alive with this level of input fidelity.</p>



<p>The<strong> pedal set includes a clutch pedal for manual transmission fans</strong>, though you can ignore it if you prefer sequential or automatic gearboxes. The brake pedal uses a progressive spring system that requires actual pressure to fully depress and mimicks the resistance you’d feel through a real brake system. This pressure sensitivity means you can trail-brake into corners and modulate braking force with precision instead of treating it like an on-off switch. The gas pedal has lighter resistance for smooth throttle control, which matters enormously when you’re trying to manage traction out of slow corners.</p>
<p>Logitech’s G HUB software provides granular control over force feedback strength, wheel sensitivity and button mapping on PC. You can create different profiles for different games, since each title responds to wheel settings differently. Some games need stronger force feedback to communicate properly, while others work better with subtler forces. The <strong>wheel connects via USB and draws power from your console or PC</strong>, so there’s no separate power brick to manage.</p>
<p>The <strong>G29 works natively with PS5, PS4, PC, and Mac</strong>, though game support varies by platform and title. Most major racing sims and simcades recognize the wheel immediately, without the need for driver installations or complicated configuration. The wheel includes a full complement of PlayStation buttons integrated into the face, so you can navigate menus and access game functions without reaching for a controller.</p>
<p>At $229, this Black Friday price makes the Logitech G29 more accessible than ever for people who’ve been curious about sim racing but couldn’t justify spending $400-plus on a pricey alternative. This hundred-dollar discount brings the entry cost down to where impulse purchases start making sense, especially if you’ve already got a racing game library waiting for proper hardware.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-hard-on-sonos-now-selling-the-beam-soundbar-for-a-pocket-change-this-black-friday-2000645680</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos guards its pricing religiously throughout the year and refuses to discount even when competitors slash their prices for random sales events. Black Friday on Amazon is<strong> the only time Sonos loosens its grip on retail prices</strong>, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Beam (second gen) soundbar just dropped to a new record low of $349, down from its usual $499</a>. Only 16 units remain in stock for the black color at the time of writing, which tells you how quickly people are grabbing this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos in a Compact Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>Beam soundbar packs Dolby Atmos processing into a soundbar that measures just 25.6 inches wide</strong>, which means it fits under most TVs without dominating your entertainment center. Atmos creates a three-dimensional sound effect that places audio above, around, and beside you instead of just firing sound from the front. The soundbar uses psychoacoustic processing to bounce sound off your ceiling and walls and creates the impression of height channels without installing speakers overhead. Explosions in action movies feel like they’re happening above you, rain sounds fall from the ceiling, and helicopters pass convincingly overhead.</p>



<p>Sonos engineered the Beam soundbar with <strong>dedicated drivers for different frequency ranges</strong> including a center tweeter that’s specifically responsible for crystal-clear dialogue reproduction. The clarity of the dialogue is enormously important in modern content, where mumbling actors and aggressive sound mixing often bury conversations under music and effects. The bass response is full of lively low-end that doesn’t require a separate subwoofer, although Sonos does let you add their Sub if you want room-shaking bass when watching movies or listening to music.</p>



<p><strong>Setup, from unboxing to content with better audio, takes about five minutes</strong>. You connect one HDMI cable from the soundbar to your TV’s eARC or ARC port, plug in the power cable, and the Sonos app will walk you through the rest. Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to analyze your room’s acoustics and then auto-adjusts the soundbar’s output to compensate for room size, furniture placement, and wall materials.</p>
<p>The Beam soundbar streams music, podcasts, radio, and audiobooks from just about every major service when your TV is off. You can use it as a dedicated music speaker throughout the day, then seamlessly switch to TV audio in the evening. AirPlay 2 support allows for direct streaming from an Apple device, while the Sonos app provides access to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens of other services. For voice control, you can use Alexa or Google Assistant built directly into the soundbar, adjusting volume, changing inputs, or controlling playback with ease and without the touch of a remote.</p>
<p>Because of HDMI-CEC, <strong>your TV remote controls the Beam soundbars’s volume automatically</strong> and saves you from having to juggle multiple remotes or programming universal controllers. The soundbar responds immediately to the volume buttons on your existing remote after you set it up, which makes the whole system feel integrated rather than cobbled together.</p>
<p>At $349, the latest Beam soundbar is $150 off its usual price and undercuts a number of competing soundbars that offer similar features but notably worse sound quality. Sonos rarely discounts its products because they’re worth their full value based on performance alone, but this Black Friday deal is a real doozy.</p>

              <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s partnership with Disney has brought it some extraordinary crossover events, not least <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142">the current chapter’s enormous&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em> tie-in</a>. But you haven’t seen anything yet: After Chapter 6 reaches its big finale at the end of this month, Chapter 7 is going to introduce the most unlikely property yet: Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill</em>. In fact, it seems like it might be going far further than that, filling in a gap in the legendary movie’s lore by recreating a lost scripted chapter, Yuki’s Revenge, that was never shot for the film. This is all right in time to promote the cinematic re-release of both movies in one, the four hour and 41 minute <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bill-whole-bloody-affair-return-theaters-december-4-hour-tarantino-2000631123"><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em></a>.</p> <p>Yuki’s Revenge was a chapter written in the original script for <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>, but was never shot for the movie. It was originally going to be Chapter 5 (I know, it’s confusing, both&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Kill Bill </em>use chapters), and <a href="https://kill-bill.livejournal.com/357796.html">you can read the original script here</a>. The scene would have starred Gogo Yubari’s sister, Yuki, who went entirely unmentioned in the released movie, and was originally going to hunt down The Bride to avenge her sister’s death. Well, now, as improbable as this feels to type, it seems the events could finally play out in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>?</p>

 <p>Chapter 7’s first promotional poster (above) has a picture of <em>Kill Bill</em> characters Gogo Yubari and The Bride, accompanied by a shades-wearing Fishstick, along with the words “The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge” before “Fortnite After Dark.” An <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRQXUuwgZjX/">official Instagram post</a> says the same, but this time has Yubari and Peely, because we officially live in the weirdest timeline.</p>   <p>Tarantino and The Bride actor Uma Thurman showed up to an event last night which <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15308673/Uma-Thurman-Kill-Bill-T-shirt-reunites-Quentin-Tarantino.html"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> confusingly describes as “the premiere” of <em>The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge</em>, and the pair were photographed in front of a huge <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>banner promoting the Chapter 7, alongside a model of the movie’s Pussy Wagon. Although exactly what this event really was is peculiarly unclear, with outlets like <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> and&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em> not even having articles about it. Have they filmed the scene? Will it be part of the new seven minute animated sequence that’s being added to the theatrical release of the movie double-bill? It’s all bewildering. We have, of course, reached out to Epic to try to find out more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino poses by the "P*ssy Wagon" at the "Fortnite Chapter 7" event in LA. <a href="https://t.co/reOwxBjUqH">pic.twitter.com/reOwxBjUqH</a></p> <p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1991302219904479362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Whether this recreation of the missing chapter will be a storyline event within the game, or some sort of live event taking place on the in-game big screens, is also unknown at this point. What seems fairly certain is that Chapter 7 will feature <em>Kill Bill</em> skins and characters, and we can only assume lots of long swords.</p> <p>However, it also seems The Bride will be showing up sooner than that, as part of Chapter 6’s big finale live event. A new trailer shows her arriving on her motorbike admidst the ludicrous confusion of King Kong, Godzilla, <em>Star Wars</em> X-Wings, and a mostly naked Homer Simpson throwing a giant donut. <em>Fortnite</em>, everyone! That’s all taking place November 29, 2 p.m. ET.</p>
