Boring. We need something new and fresh. And Valve is ready to provide that with its newly revealed white and gray Steam Deck. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1856112657834860877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1856112657834860877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 11</a></span>, Valve announced the limited edition all-white Steam Deck OLED.

This is our second experiment along those lines,” said Valve.</p><p>As someone who was planning to wait to upgrade their Steam Deck until the next major revision, this all-white option is making it hard to stick to that commitment. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
