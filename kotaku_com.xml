              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Fortnite’s</em> latest season is all about</a> <em>The Simpsons,</em> the long-running animated sitcom that premiered in 1989 and is still running on Fox to this day. And one location in the new Springfield-inspired island is The Simpsons’ home, a strange, mysterious place that has no set layout and changes from episode to episode. And somehow, Epic had to recreate this cartoon logic in a static location for a video game, and the end result is, as you might expect, weird in its own way.</p> <p>I want to warn you now that the rest of this post is filled with some <a href="https://kotaku.com/homer-cubed-3d-treehouse-horror-fox-30-years-ago-1995-2000639909"><em>Simpsons</em></a> nerd nonsense. Be prepared for that. If the idea of someone seriously thinking about the layout of a cartoon home might upset you, I’d suggest you move on to something else. For everyone else, let’s go.</p>

 <p>742 Evergreen Terrace, aka the Simpsons’ home, is a place that many of you are likely familiar with and can imagine in your mind. Even if you haven’t watched the long-running animated series in many, many years, I bet the iconic Simpsons house is still rattling around up there in your grey matter. But let me ask you some questions. How many bathrooms does it contain? Where’s the door to the basement? Is there a closet in the foyer? How does the garage connect to the rest of the living space? You might think you know the answer to some or even all of these queries, but you’d be wrong because the <a href="https://x.com/Joshstrangehill/status/1255163988163215360">show’s writers and artists are always changing the house</a>.</p>

 <h2>The weird place next to the kitchen</h2> <p>For example, let’s dive into the hallway to the right of the kitchen. This is one of the least documented spots in the Simpsons’ house in the entire series. Scenes rarely happen here; the show often uses camera angles that hide most of this spot, and the layout of this area changes constantly. Sometimes there’s a door over here to the basement, but sometimes that door leads to the garage. This area is also where the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/742_Evergreen_Terrace#Rooms:~:text=There%20is%20a%20rarely,appearance%20in%20later%20episodes.">legendary rumpus room</a> exists, though there are episodes where this room is missing entirely. So how does <em>Fortnite</em> handle this bizarre area? In it’s own really weird way!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641155">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Epic has decided to expand this usually empty utility space and has added a foosball table, dart board, and chair. The rumpus room is still here, but lacks a door. And oddly, there’s now a laundry room or mud room connecting the garage to this part of the house. This laundry room area is a totally new invention for <em>Fortnite</em>, and I think it’s only here because Epic stuck a bathroom down here and had some space to fill.</p>

 <p>Oh, and yeah, there’s a bathroom down here. Some fans have theorized there might be one here; otherwise, the Simpsons would have to go upstairs every time they need to use the toilet. But evidence of a downstairs bathroom is scarce, and when it has appeared, like under the stairs in the foyer, it rarely sticks around. So I guess shoving a bathroom down in this hallway is probably the best option. As for a basement door, nope. There’s not even a basement at all. Epic just didn’t include it.</p>

 <h2>Things are weird upstairs, too</h2> <p>Moving upstairs, things get even weirder, but that’s not entirely Epic’s fault. This section of the Simpsons’ house, where you can find the characters’ bedrooms and at least one bathroom, is a very strange place. The layout here can shift from episode to episode or even scene to scene, with Bart’s room moving around at least twice in the episode “My Sister, My Sitter.” So trying to model this area was always going to be tricky. And for the most part, I think Epic did a good job. But uh, what the heck is this area?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641156">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When I first spotted this odd hallway/sitting area connected to the master bedroom, I was extremely confused. There’s a couch up here? What is going on? Even weirder, this is where Epic has decided to shove the upstairs bathroom. I guess Epic didn’t want to have this space be a bathroom, as that would mean the master bedroom would be connected to both the upstairs bathroom and the master bath. Which would be odd, but I find this whole new room and space even weirder.</p> <p>However, in a way, Epic adding two new spaces to the Simpsons’ house is perfectly on brand for this place. The Simpsons’ house is and always has been a wild mess that changes constantly to suit the needs of whatever joke or story is being told. Like the show’s timeline and reality, the house is extremely flexible, and that’s fine. This is an animated comedy. The house and everything else can move around as much as needed as long as I’m laughing. It just means that when you start to think about it or have to rebuild it in a video game as a static object, things get funky.

              <p>The computer role-playing game, most widely known as the RPG, turns 50 today! Well, as close as we can pin it, anyway. Happy birthday, RPGs!</p> <p>In 1974, the year <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> began publication, a couple of guys at Southern Illinois University called Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood became interested in programming in the TUTOR language for the educational computer system PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations). PLATO was kind of extraordinary: a network of around a dozen mainframe computers running processes for several thousand terminals around the world. And like all educational devices, the University of Illinois’ PLATO was frequently misused by students, in this case to create a role-playing game on that proto-internet. That game was to be <em>The Game of Dungeons</em>, more commonly known—because of its filename—as <em>dnd.</em></p> <p>In 1975, a University of Illinois resident called Rusty Rutherford—aware of the as-yet unfinished <em>dnd</em> but not involved—spent a handful of weeks creating his own RPG for PLATO. His was called <em>The Dungeon</em>, but again due to filenames became known as <em>pedit5</em>. Due to the speed with which Rutherford worked, <em>pedit5</em> would release first, and as such take the mantle of the first-ever RPG.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, at the Claremont University Center in California, student Don Daglow (the person responsible for the first-ever baseball game in 1971, <em>Baseball</em>, and the first-ever RTS game in 1981, <em>Utopia</em>) worked on a game for the DEC mainframe computer, the PDP-10, also based on 1974’s breakout pen-and-paper hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was called—wait for it—<em>Dungeon</em>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>, it’s unknown whether the game released in 1975 or 1976, but given Daglow’s propensity for being first to genres, the former seems more likely. (He also made the first MMO in 1991, <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, and on November 4, 1975, another PLATO-based RPG—this time multiplayer—was released by John D. Daleske and Gary Fritz among others, with the groundbreaking title of…<em>Dungeon</em>.</p> <p>So whether&nbsp;<em>The Game of Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon,</em> or&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> was first, what we know for sure is that they appeared in 1975, 50 years ago, and one of them on this exact day. Which is plenty of reason to mark today as the day to celebrate the birth of the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641119"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641119">© John D. Daleske et al</figcaption></figure> <p>It seems to be generally accepted that Rutherford’s&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em> was the very first of them all, a game about wandering through a single floor of a dungeon while doing the two most important RPG things: killing monsters and collecting treasure. There were spells to cast, with randomly generated enemies and loot, and a battle and leveling system based on the rules of the brand new <em>D&amp;D</em>. It was all there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162725/http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/1948">albeit limited to around 50 rooms and only 20 stored characters across the whole network</a>, due to the hefty limitations of the system. That name, <em>pedit5</em>, <a href="https://insight.ieeeusa.org/articles/going-rogue-a-brief-history-of-the-computerized-dungeon-crawl/">came from the area in which the code was stored</a>, sectioned off for Rutherford’s department of the Population and Energy Group. The group had five slots, the first three used for relevant programming, while the fifth stored&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em> and the fourth contained its manual. As a result, the university naturally deleted this frippery to make room for “proper” programs, but Rutherford persistently re-added it.</p>

  <p><em>dnd</em>, meanwhile, was a story as old as time: a game with large ambitions that was thus delayed and scaled back before eventually being “released.” The intention had been for the game to be a graphical multi-user dungeon (MUD), but this was never achieved, and the game eventually emerged as a more complex version of&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>. From my reading, there appears to be a fair amount of confusion over whether developers Whisenhunt and Wood created their game contemporaneously with&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>, or whether it eventually became an embellished version of the earlier game. Either way,&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> offered a multi-layer dungeon called Whisenwood, in which players sought a mystical Grail and Orb. Once again, it merrily ripped off <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ core rules, leveling and spells, although didn’t feature <em>pedit5</em>‘s randomization. But it also boasts two extremely important firsts of its very own.</p>

 <p>The first first for&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> is nonlinearity: Players were able to return to previously explored levels, approaching the game in their own preferred order, relying on the fixed position of enemies and items to let the computer network to store all that data. The second first, and perhaps the more significant, is that this was the first game to feature a boss encounter. Heck, this post could easily have been titled “Happy 50th Birthday, Boss Fights.” Each dungeon’s exit was guarded by a high-level monster, including the Golden Dragon that protected the Orb.</p>

 <p>Then, come November 4, we get the release of the PLATO network’s&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> which,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/101218/dungeon/">according to <em>Mobygames</em>,</a> is considered one of the first-ever MUD games. However, there’s a weirdly small amount of information out there about this one other than that, none of which supports its being multiplayer. The <a href="https://crpgadventures.blogspot.com/2014/08/dungeon-1975.html">wonderful obsessives over at&nbsp;<em>CRPG Adventures</em></a> have been similarly stumped, unable to get it running at all.&nbsp;<a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2021/06/brief-everything-we-know-about-1970s.html"><em>CRPG Addict</em> also had no joy</a>, finding the game missing from many retrospectives, but noting that it was <a href="https://www.daleske.com/plato/plato-games.php">marked by co-creator Daleske</a> as “incomplete,” and also as a “predecessor to <em>Moria.”&nbsp;</em>That would appear to be 1975’s PLATO <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/100905/moria/"><em>Moria</em></a> by Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin, yet another RPG from that year, but this one able to have ten players joining in together. It was played in the most basic form of first-person you can imagine, but that’s enough for it to claim the title of first 3D RPG! All in that same year!</p>  <p>Obviously none of these games were technically “released,” instead being stored on university servers and spread by word-of-mouth among students and staff. This had been the case since the early 1970s, with text-based adventures already proving popular on the same systems. Others took over development of some of the games mentioned above, elaborating on them through the late ’70s as the technology improved, but it wouldn’t be until 1980 and the arrival of <em>Rogue</em> as a commercial product that anything like an RPG could be considered as becoming mainstream as opposed to mainframe.</p> <p>But it remains undeniable that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the RPG as a computer game, and with&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> (PLATO)’s November 4 release, today as good as any date on which to recognize it.</p> <p>Happy birthday, RPGs! 50 years old and still one of the most popular types of games on the planet. From <i>dnd </i>to&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the impact of the <em>D&amp;D</em>-inspired genre on video games cannot be overstated.</p>
