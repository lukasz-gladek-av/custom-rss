              <p>Good morning and good day. I welcome you all back to Morning Checkpoint. Drink some coffee. Eat a bagel. Go to the bathroom. Now with all that out of the way, let’s get to some news and other stuff. Today, we have a <em>Marvel Rivals</em> leak, a giant <em>Zelda</em> collection, trouble in <em>Roblox</em>, and a new <em>Lumines</em> demo that won’t be around for long. Oh, and some new gameplay of a <em>Fallout/Doom</em> mod that looks sweet.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> leak seemingly reveals Deadpool is coming</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-teases-deadpool-daredevil/">As spotted by <em>Insider Gaming</em>,</a> a <em>Marvel Rivals</em> leaker has shared some new voice lines that seemingly reveal Deadpool is coming to the popular online free-to-play hero shooter. In a video posted on Twitter on August 25, leaker XOXLeak shared two alleged Deadpool voice lines as well as a host of replies from other characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> referencing the Merc With A Mouth. That same leaker also shared evidence that Daredevil is coming to <em>Rivals</em>, too.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hero voice interactions w/ Deadpool <a href="https://t.co/MSGT2fSTtU">pic.twitter.com/MSGT2fSTtU</a></p> <p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1960089802709356544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s possible these audio files are fake or were included in the game’s data to throw off dataminers. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/no-marvel-rivals-developer-netease-isnt-intentionally-planting-fake-leaks-to-mess-with-everyone-but-its-datamined-characters-arent-guaranteed-to-appear-in-the-future-either/">The devs behind the game have explained</a> that not <em>every</em> piece of content datamined from the game will end up in <em>Rivals</em>. And AI voice-gen tools are better than ever these days, so these audio lines could all be fake.&nbsp; But Deadpool has been a rumored <em>Rivals</em> character for a bit now, and he’s a very popular Marvel hero, so it seems likely he’ll be added in the future.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Lumines Arise</em> gets a demo, but just for a week</strong></h2> <p>Rejoice, as we now have a release date for <em>Lumines Arise</em>, the next entry in the wonderful music puzzler series. It’s out in November on PS5 and PC. Nice! <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lumines-arise-gets-a-demo-on-ps5-and-steam-to-celebrate-its-release-date-announcement-but-its-for-one-week-only/">And a demo for the game has been shadow-dropped on PS5 and Steam</a>, which is cool. But sadly, this demo will only be around for a week. Bleh. But hey, I can’t complain about getting to play more <em>Lumines</em> for free, even if it’s just for a week. We must all cherish the good news during these dark days.</p> <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> players were disappointed by Lady Gaga’s <em>Dress To Impress</em> event</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, one of <em>Roblox’s</em> biggest games, <em>Dress To Impress</em>, held a large in-game event featuring Lady Gaga. The famous singer and actress was actually playing the game and fans were excited to meet her and hear her speak. However, that didn’t happen. Lady Gaga hung out in a separate server where only a few select players and influencers could interact with her, and she communicated via text chat. When some fans got angry about this, a community manager for the game reportedly said on stream: “None of you are forced to be here. If you’re unhappy, just leave.” Needless to say, it was a mess.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi everyone. We would like to take the opportunity to apologise to you and take accountability. We took the time to read over messages sent by a lot of you in the chat.</p> <p>I want to begin by apologising for my defensiveness personally. As a community manager, it is not professional…</p> <p>— Dress To Impress (@_Dress2Impress) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Dress2Impress/status/1959707211262734787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dress-to-impress-lady-gaga-meet-and-greet-leaves-fans-disappointed/1100-6534261/">On August 23, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em>,</a> <em>Dress To Impres</em>s posted <a href="https://x.com/_Dress2Impress/status/1959707211262734787">a lengthy apology on Twitter</a>. In the message, the community manager apologized for her behavior, and the devs explained why the event was so limited. They blamed <em>Roblox’s</em> tech limits for the lack of Lady Gaga’s voice being broadcast to players and said limited server space was to blame for the lack of a real meet and greet. The folks behind the online dress-up game are promising to do better in the future.</p>

 <h2><strong>The largest collection of <em>Zelda</em> stuff in the world</strong></h2> <p>Constantine Adams, a software engineer from Fairfax, Virginia, has the largest collection of <em>Legend of Zelda</em> memorabilia in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. <a href="https://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/legend-zelda-collection-fairfax-city-worlds-largest-guinness">As reported by Patch,</a> the collection contains over 4,000 items and is housed in the collector’s large basement. In July, Guinness confirmed it to be the largest in the world.</p> <p>“I’ve been very quiet about my collection for a long time,” Adams told the outlet. “It was just a goal, right? There was something challenging to do, and I enjoyed it. It was hard at times. I’m not jumping up and down because of it. But now’s my time to show it off and say, ‘Here it is.’”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Overwatch 2</em>‘s director is aware of the game’s horrible Steam rating</strong></h2> <p>Things are looking up for <em>Overwatch 2</em> these days. The game’s Stadium mode has been celebrated by many players, and its new characters have been popular. But over on Steam, <em>Overwatch 2</em>‘s overall rating is still a “mostly negative” 25 percent. <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch-2/gamescom-2025-interview"><em>PCGamesN</em> asked</a> <em>Overwatch 2</em> game director Aaron Keller if he was aware of the low score.</p> <p>“It’s something that I do think about a lot. Our active players are telling us, ‘Hey, the game is in the best state that it’s ever been in, or has been in for a really long time. You have to reconcile that with the reputation from a much broader gaming community,” Keller told the outlet.</p> <p>“[That reputation] is one of the reasons we’re taking bigger swings&nbsp; – we’re trying to break through some of that noise and let players who may have written<em>&nbsp;Overwatch 2</em>&nbsp;off know that there’s still really exciting things happening in this game. I think if the players who stopped playing a year ago or two years ago jumped in right now, they’d recognize that there is something&nbsp;very different&nbsp;about the game, and that it’s come a really long way. I think that it has leveled up as a competitive&nbsp;FPS game. It’s giving players more strategic choice inside of a match, and, if you look at Stadium, there’s more ways to transform the way any hero plays.”</p> <h2><strong>ICYMI:&nbsp;</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/replaced-release-date-cyberpunk-pixel-art-batman-arkham-2000620061"><em>Replaced</em>, that cool-looking cybernoir action game, has a new release date</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-delta-3-remake-ps5-pro-performance-mode-2000620023">That new <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> remake isn’t running well on consoles</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/us-open-tennis-medvedev-bonzi-delay-crowd-yelling-booing-racket-smash-2000620025">The US Open was delayed for a bit because the crowd wouldn’t stop booing</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout: Bakersfield Extended Gameplay Footage" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0Wv6kkloCU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-is-plunging-players-into-the-horrors-of-the-bug-homeworlds.1280796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s next big content drop is right around the corner and it’s taking players into the depths of the chemical fog-infested Terminid home worlds. Revealed on Tuesday, Into the Unjust arrives in September alongside a new Devil’s Dust Warbond just a week after the hot PlayStation extraction shooter launches on Xbox Series X/S.</p> <p>After spending the summer fending off Illuminate invasions and jetpack-toting Automatons, Into the Unjust will send players back into the alien bug breach, tasking them with missions deep in Terminid territory that will include blowing up giant bug towers and navigating deep underground through their tunnel systems. New objective types will include escorting a giant moving oil rig as it gets attacked. We are so back.</p> <p>Fans will also have access to a bunch of new equipment coming in the Devil’s Dust Warbond. Here’s a breakdown <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">from the PlayStation Blog</a>:</p>

 <blockquote> <p><strong>AR-2 Coyote</strong><strong><br> </strong>You can hunt in packs or go by your lonesome with this assault rifle that features incendiary ammunition. But be warned: this coyote is wild.</p> <p><strong>G-7 Pineapple</strong><strong><br> </strong>This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</p> <p><strong>S-11 Speargun</strong><strong><br> </strong>A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</p> <p><strong>EAT-700 Expendable Napalm</strong><strong><br> </strong>Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</p> <p><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo</strong><strong><br> </strong>The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Warbond will also include new armor that boosts resistance to toxins and other hazards players are likely to face in the thick of the Terminid fog. Combined with the new Strategems coming in the update, it should give lapsed players some fun new toys worth unlocking.</p> <p>But it’ll be baptism by fire for all of the players picking up <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for the first time on Xbox this week. Live today roughly 18 months after launching on PS5 and PC, the Xbox release should bring about an influx of players that tips the scales back in Super Democracy’s favor amid the game’s ongoing <em>D&amp;D</em>-style Galactic War meta game. It’ll also indicate just how much of a market there is for PS5 console exclusives on Microsoft’s rival platform.</p> <p>A successful campaign against the bugs won’t just unlock the next chapter in <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s story, it could also usher in the next phase of cross-platform ports from Sony’s first-party portfolio. But fans will have to survive untold new alien horrors first.</p>
