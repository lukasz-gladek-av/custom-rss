              <p>Shaky footage is frustrating and, well, headache-inducing, especially when it ends up ruining a perfectly beautiful moment. If you film with your phone and are looking to enjoy stable, steady results, you might want to invest in a gimbal stabilizer.</p>
<p>DJI makes some of the best filming accessories on the market, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">we just spotted its Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal stabilizer going at a 20% discount on Amazon.</a> It’s now available for just $103, after the retailer took a sweet $26 off its usual $129 price. Placing your orders today can also help you enjoy free delivery with your purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further. Just be sure to act fast, as the offer is expected to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Steady, Hands-Free Footage</h2>
<p>This stabilizer works with both iPhones and Android smartphones. It’s powered by DJI’s seventh-generation stabilization technology to ensure cinema-quality high and low-angle footage at your fingertips, wherever you go. Getting started couldn’t be easier. Unfolding the gimbal turns it on, while the magnetic design makes mounting any paired phone a breeze. Once the phone is up, access the Mimo app with a single click and get to filming right away.</p>
<p>There’s support for native camera features like Apple ProRes and zoom tracking, plus the stabilizer plays nicely with different live streaming apps. Gesture control makes it easy to operate the thing from afar. For instance, the “palm” gesture starts/stops recording, the “Double L” gesture adjusts framing, and making a “V” takes a photo without you having to manually click any buttons. Additionally, you’re getting a built-in fill light which adjusts brightness and color temperature for better, Instagram-worthy results, even in low light conditions.</p>
<p>DJI Mimo offers dual-lens, active tracking. This allows the subject to move freely around while still staying in focus. Play basketball with your little ones, or just show off some dance moves without worrying about the camera focusing on the tree behind. And when there are more than one subjects in the frame, you can effortlessly switch between them by tapping on their selection boxes on your phone. This way, everyone gets to be in the spotlight!</p>



<p>The all-in-one design of the gimbal offers multiple use cases. You can hold it to take selfies or record on the go, as well as set it down as a tripod for solo creation and recording videos. Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you an operating time of around 10 hours, which is great for extended filming and those long live sessions. Even better, the gimbal is also capable of powering your phone, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of your smartphone’s battery in the middle of filming an exciting adventure.</p>
<p>Note that you need the DJI Mimo app to get started with using the gimbal. It’s not available on Google Play due to some compatibility issues, but you can install it using the official DJI website.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this gimbal makes filming a lot more fun, and convenient. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">It typically retails for around $129, but the current discount lets you grab it for $103</a>. There are no delivery charges to worry about, either, so $103 is all you’ve got to pay. Just be sure to get your orders in before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The First New Switch 2 Joy-Con Colors Barely Look Any Different]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/joy-con-colors-switch-2-mario-tennis-fever-2000658135</link>
            <guid>1400425</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has revealed the first variant Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2 and they’re not as colorful as some might have hoped. Still mostly all graphite black, the new Joy-Con sport subtle lines of lily purple and mint green and arrive next month for $100.</p> <p>The new options ship on February 12, the same day as <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, though they don’t seem to have any obvious thematic overlap with the Switch 2 sports game or its colors. Like the existing orange and blue Joy-Con, the colors are limited to the inset around the thumbsticks and the sides where they connect magnetically to the console. For anyone playing in handheld mode, most of what’s “new” about these variants won’t even be visible most of the time.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As you enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioTennisFever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarioTennisFever</a>, you’ll also have the opportunity to give your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> a new look! </p> <p>The first new colored Joy-Con 2 controllers—Light Purple and Light Green—also arrive Feb 12. </p> <p>Pre-purchase now: <a href="https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp">https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp</a> <a href="https://t.co/JoE8r4oOQl">pic.twitter.com/JoE8r4oOQl</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is it a big surprise that Nintendo is, at least for now, sticking with the more sophisticated, less whimsical sensibility of the existing Switch 2 Joy-Con? Not entirely. But it’s definitely a bit deflating for anyone who’s been waiting for something cool to come along before upgrading to a second pair of controllers. You’d get as much difference out of sticking different-colored nubs on the thumbsticks (which you should do anyway because the base ones are no good).</p>

 <p>The first year of the Switch 1 saw multiple new, full-color variants ship alongside games like <em>Arms</em> and <em>Splatoon 2</em>. They were bright, exciting, and fun. One of my favorite things from that console era is now having a drawer full of different colored Joy-Con that looks like someone dumped out a box of oversized crayons. Maybe we’ll get to those eventually. For now, fans will have to settle for “Joy-Con™ 2 (L)/(R) Light Purple / Light Green.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-xtreme-3-is-back-to-its-black-friday-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-portable-speaker-2000658112</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A solid speaker can bring life to any gathering, and even upgrade those solo streaming sessions at night. Hardly any brand does music better than JBL, and today is a great time to grab one of its top-rated speakers for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">Amazon has – quite generously – dropped the price of the JBL Xtreme 3 speaker by 39%.</a> You can now pick it up for $200, after a whopping $130 discount. The offer applies to all three color options, including black, blue, and camo. The deal is open to all shoppers (both Prime and non-Prime members), but we’re expecting it to wrap up soon. If you’ve been looking for an option that lets you enjoy your favorite beats to the fullest, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Music Going All Night</h2>
<p>The JBL Xtreme 3 is a powerful, yet portable speaker. It comes with a detachable carrying strap that makes the speaker easy to take with you on the go, plus a built-in bottle opener for added convenience, especially when you’re partying in the great outdoors. The overall design is quite sturdy and can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>Sound-wise, it’s got four drivers and two JBL Bass Radiators that push deep, rich sound for all your tracks. You’ll also enjoy bold bass for energy-filled songs – the kind that makes everyone want to step on the dance floor and show off some cool moves. Whether you’re just using the speaker to listen to a podcast in your living room or for vibing to the latest Coldplay album, it delivers exceptionally well across all genres and audio types.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xtreme 3 is IP67 waterproof and dustproof, which means you can bring it anywhere without worry. Take it to the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower. Starting to rain in the backyard during a jamming session? That won’t be a problem, either. As for the battery life, it’s better than most options in this range. A single charge gets you up to 15 hours of playtime. That’s more than enough to keep the party going all night, and well into the next day! Plus, recharging doesn’t take forever, either, so even when you’re running low, the speaker should be back up in no time.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, the speaker can be paired with up to two smartphones or tablets at the same time. You can connect it to your phone and your friend’s, then easily take turns playing your favorite tracks. The PartyBoost feature deserves a mention, too, here. It allows you to pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers together for an even bigger, bolder sound when you want to entertain a larger crowd. Just ask a loved one to bring theirs, and have your own private concert with stereo sound at home!</p>
<p>Altogether, the JBL Xtreme 3 delivers powerful sound in a compact build. You will also enjoy a long battery life, plus incredible durability with its IP67 rating. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $330 to enjoy these features, but the current deal lets you pick the speaker up for just $200.</a> Discounts this good don’t last long, though. It’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
