              <p>For years now, Samsung has dominated the foldable phone market with its Galaxy Z Fold line, and the Galaxy Z Fold7 brings forth the sixth generation of this revolutionary smartphone. The great news today is that<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/"> Amazon currently offers this 512GB variant for $1,680, down from $2,119</a>. Samsung can’t offer that on their website which make it a legitimate all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Screens That Redefine Mobile Productivity</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold7 boasts dual screens that seamlessly work together to redefine how you use a smartphone. The 6.3-inch cover screen smoothly handles your quick tasks and one-handed operations, while <strong>unfolding it reveals a massive 7.6-inch main display</strong>, reminiscent of tablet territory. This inner screen incorporates Samsung’s Ultra Thin Glass technology, which feels remarkably different from the plastic screens of folding phones past. <strong>A 120Hz refresh rate</strong> on both displays ensures smooth scrolling-be it flipping through emails on the cover screen or multitasking on the main display.</p>
<p>The hinge mechanism has been refined through six generations of engineering and it’s great: Samsung reduced the crease visibility significantly compared to previous models, though you’ll still feel it slightly when running your finger across the center. The <em>JetBlack</em> finish resists fingerprints better than glossy alternatives, and the Armor Aluminum frame adds durability without excessive weight. <strong>Samsung rates this phone for 200,000 folds</strong>&nbsp;which translates to roughly five years of opening and closing the device 100 times daily.</p>



<p>The brightness goes up to 2,600 nits peak, and outdoors, it’s perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. You will be very comfortable reading the screen at the beach or navigating maps while walking around town. Samsung’s adaptive color technology adjusts the display to match the ambient lighting, thus reducing eye strain during long uses.</p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor powers the Z Fold7</strong> and dlivers desktop-class performance in a foldable form factor. This chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, gaming, and AI processing without breaking a sweat. The 512GB storage option gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and 4K videos without constantly managing space. Samsung pairs this with 12GB of RAM, ensuring smooth app switching even when running multiple resource-intensive applications.</p>
<p>The battery – 4,600mAh – may sound modest on paper but Samsung’s optimization makes it<strong> last over a full day with moderate usage</strong>. The heavy users who push both screens hard might need a top-up by evening, but typical usage patterns easily stretch from morning to bedtime. Fast charging at 25W will get you to 50% in about 30 minutes, though Samsung doesn’t include a charger in the box.</p>



<p>The<strong> new triple camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor</strong> that captures stunning details in most lighting conditions. Samsung’s AI processing enhances the photos automatically to adjust colors and sharpness, depending on the scene. Further, the 12MP ultra-wide camera shoots group shots and landscape photography, while the 10MP telephoto lens offers 3x optical zoom for distant subjects. A secondary 10MP telephoto camera includes 2x optical zoom to give you more flexibility in framing without compromising on image quality.</p>
<p><strong>Android 15 runs underneath Samsung’s One UI 7 </strong>with the interface optimized for foldable displays. When you unfold the phone, it intelligently expands apps to take advantage of the screen real estate. A taskbar along the bottom of the main display lets you quickly switch between your most-used apps and recent tasks. You can drag and drop content between apps, copy text from one application and paste into another, and resize app windows to fit your workflow.</p>
<p>Samsung promises<strong> four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches</strong>.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that early Black Friday deal as it could run out of stock quickly.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-240hz-34-inch-curved-oled-monitor-goes-at-new-all-time-low-black-friday-has-started-early.1354942/</guid>

              <p>It’s always been a given that gaming monitors come with a high price tag, especially when you’re talking about OLED technology with specs that push the limits of what’s possible. LG’s 34-inch Ultragear has been the reference point for serious gamers, but its $1,399 price kept it out of reach for many enthusiasts. Amazon just drastically upended that equation by dropping this curved beast down to $679, or nearly half off the original price. This all-time low opens up premium OLED gaming to a much wider audience who have been just looking for the right moment to improve their screens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Curve Meets Speed</h2>
<p>This<strong> 34-inch display features an 800R curvature</strong> that aggressively wraps around your field of view compared to most other curved monitors you might have laid eyes on. LG steepened the curve enough to draw in peripheral vision into the action for an immersive experience not possible with flat-screen monitors. The curve works a treat in racing games or flight simulators where spatial awareness counts. You’ll notice how the edges of the screen stay within your natural viewing angle without requiring constant head movement.</p>
<p>The <strong>OLED panel delivers perfect blacks</strong> because each pixel can turn off completely and creates an infinite contrast ratio in practice. LG rates this at 1.5 million to one, but the real-world impact is in dark game scenes where you can actually distinguish details in shadows. The 1300-nit peak brightness might sound excessive, but it makes HDR content truly pop with highlights that leap off the screen.</p>



<p>The anti-glare coating does a great job <strong>with ambient light for an OLED display</strong>; you can game during the day without fighting reflections from windows or overhead lights. The 3<strong>440 x 1440 resolution gives you 34% more pixels than standard 1440p displays</strong>&nbsp;while the 21:9 aspect ratio expands your horizontal view in supported games. This ultrawide format is particularly great in competitive shooters where you can see more of the battlefield and that will give you an edge</p>
<p>It pushes four times more frames per second <strong>at 240Hz</strong> than the standard 60Hz monitors. This makes quite a difference in fast-paced games in which split-second reactions often make a lot of difference. You notice the difference clearly in the moments of fast panning of the camera or tracking fast-moving objects across the screen. With a <strong>response time of 0.03ms</strong>, you get almost zero motion blur or ghosting during rapid movements.</p>
<p>Both <strong>AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility</strong> ensure that your gameplay will be silky smooth. These technologies synchronize your GPU’s frame output with the monitor’s refresh rate, thereby eliminating screen tearing and stuttering. You can push frame rates above 200 fps in esports titles and still maintain perfect visual fluidity.</p>
<p>Cloud gaming services such as Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna and Blacknut run directly from the monitor. You’ll be able to experience demanding game titles without the need for expensive hardware but with a good internet connection and a controller. The USB Type-C port also provides 65W of power delivery so you can charge your laptop while using the monitor as a display.</p>
<p>There is more than one HDMI 2.1 port on this monitor with support f<strong>or complete 4K at 120Hz from both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles</strong>. You get the full next-generation console experience with variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode working without a hitch. Basic audio is taken care of by onboard speakers, but serious gamers will want dedicated headphones or external speakers for the best sound.</p>
<p>This is a new all time low price on Amazon, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>
