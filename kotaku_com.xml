              <p>Portable monitors solve specific problems that laptops and tablets cannot address alone, particularly for gaming scenarios where you want larger screen real estate without lugging full-size displays. Nintendo Switch players confined to the 7/8-inch handheld screen gain dramatic improvement through 15.6-inch external displays that transform mobile gaming into living room experiences during travel or temporary setups.</p>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">15-6-inch portable monitor costs $66 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $99</a>, and hits a record-low price that undercuts competing 1080p portable displays typically selling between $80 and $120 for identical specifications. The 34% discount makes <strong>secondary displays accessible</strong> at pricing approaching basic phone accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> makes images clear and readable, and games show sharp detail instead of the blurry compromises that lower-resolution portable monitors make. When you look at the screen from the side or share it with others,<strong> the 178-degree viewing angles keep the colors and contrast true</strong>. What’s more, HDR support improves the dynamic range of compatible content by showing more detail in shadows in dark scenes and keeping highlight information that SDR displays clip.</p>



<p>The <strong>two USB-C ports with full functionality</strong> let you connect a single cable to a laptop or phone that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery. You don’t need separate power adapters or HDMI converters that make cable clutter to connect modern MacBooks, Windows laptops and flagship smartphones: They all work with simple USB-C cables. The <strong>Mini-HDMI port</strong> works with devices that don’t have USB-C video output, like gaming consoles, older laptops, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The monitor is truly portable because <strong>it is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds</strong>. The dimensions fit into laptop bags with other gear without needing special carrying cases or taking up too much room in luggage while traveling. Business travelers get presentation screens for working in hotel rooms, digital nomads set up dual-monitor workstations in cafes or coworking spaces, and students use laptop screens to do research-heavy assignments that need multiple document windows.</p>
<p>The <strong>included smart cover is made of PU leather and protects against scratches</strong> while being transported.The magnetic attachment makes it easier to attach and remove the cover than cases that need straps or closures, and the frameless design keeps it as small as possible. The grooves in the stand make it easy to find a comfortable viewing angle, whether you’re typing on a laptop or watching something hands-free.</p>



<p>The built-in dual stereo speakers let you listen to music without headphones or external speakers, but the sound quality is only okay because of physical limitations. The <strong>3.5mm audio jack lets you connect headphones</strong> or external speakers when you need better sound, but it also keeps things flexible for different uses. When sound quality isn’t as important as convenience, the speakers are good enough for video calls, watching videos, or playing games.</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape and portrait orientation support lets you work in different ways</strong> such as coding with vertical text display, reviewing documents in their native orientation, or editing portrait photos. You can change the brightness, contrast, color temperature, and input selection on the screen without having to use software or complicated button combinations.</p>
<p>The Black Friday price of $66 is the lowest ever, which means that KYY’s portable monitor costs a lot less than other 1080p displays that cost between $80 and $120 and have similar specs and build quality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Stops Caring About Profit on This Ryzen 5 Mini PC as It Clears Out the 4.5-Star Desktop Inventory]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-black-friday-deal-delivers-huge-pc-performance-from-a-tiny-desktop-unit-for-just-190-2000639063</link>
            <guid>1367353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The novelty of having a palm-sized desktop PC can wear off once you realize that, in terms of performance, it sort of just gets by. “Meh” is not the reaction you want to have for a brand-new desktop PC, even if it’s saving you money upfront. GMKtec’s G10 Mini PC is not a “meh” machine at all — it can outperform many of its bigger full-tower rivals and even some of the big-brand laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">It’s well worth the new Amazon Black Friday price of $219, which is 27% less than its full retail $300 tag for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>GMKtec has managed to stuff all sorts of goodies and useful features into this 2-pound package, starting with an AMD Ryzen 5 3500U processor that can hit 3.7GHz when you put the pedal to the metal for multitasking, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe solid-state storage drive, and integrated Radeon Vega 8 graphics that’s powerful enough (1200 MHz) to run up to three external monitors. There’s also room under the hook to expand that RAM to 64GB and enough expansion slots and ports to drive the storage as high as 16TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Underdog Wins</h2>
<p>That AMD Ryzen 5 processor and Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics might not grab your eye if you’re just skimming Amazon listings for Intel products. Which would be understandable since Intel is the gold standard for PC processors. But the Ryzen 5 3500U that’s at the heart of the GMKtec G10 has more than held its own in benchmark tests against Intel’s N-Series chips and often beats them, and for less money overall.</p>
<p>You can feel free to push the processor and the rest of the GMKtec G10 as hard as you want or need to, because all that hard work isn’t going to cause any internal meltdowns thanks to the tiny turbo cooling fan built into the mini PC’s body. That little fan can crank all day long, and do it quietly — 35 decibels, which is slightly louder than the sound of breathing.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The most important connections, of course, are the ones that get you on the internet, and the GMKtec G10 has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 along with a super-fast 2.5GB Ethernet jack. From there the connections are all about expansion and the ability to turn the GMKtec G10 into the hub of your workstation, and in that regard it’s fully loaded — dual USB-A 3.2 ports in the front, and a full array in the back, including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, along with two USB-C ports (one for data) and another USB-A 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">Jumping at this limited-time Amazon deal taking 27% off the price of the GMKtec MIni PC</a> isn’t settling. It’s grabbing a more-than-proficient desktop PC that can run up to 3 external monitors and handle all of your workload and then some for a great price — it’s just $190 while this deal lasts.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Garmin Offloads Its Cheapest Model Ever, Now Zero-Profit Play on Forerunner 55 GPS Running Watch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-offloads-its-cheapest-model-ever-now-zero-profit-play-on-forerunner-55-gps-running-watch-2000648408</link>
            <guid>1367299</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Garmin is the number one brand of sports watches but their product range spans casual weekend joggers through professional ultramarathon athletes with vastly different feature needs and budgets. If spending $1,200 on the latest Fenix 8 feels excessive for your three-times-weekly runs, substantially cheaper alternatives deliver everything recreational athletes actually need.</p>
<p>The<strong> Forerunner 55</strong> is Garmin’s most affordable running watch and it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">currently costs $149 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $199</a>. This new record-low makes legitimate GPS running watches accessible at pricing that approached basic fitness bands before this sale, while delivering the core training features that transform casual jogging into structured improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Daily Suggested Workouts</h2>
<p>The <strong>adaptive training recommendations look at your recent workouts</strong>, your current fitness level, and how well you’re recovering to suggest daily workouts of different levels of difficulty. The AI-powered suggestions help you avoid common training mistakes like getting hurt from overtraining or not making progress because you’re not putting in enough effort. After hard interval sessions, easy run days give your body time to recover while keeping your training consistent, which is what really makes you fitter. Instead of giving vague advice,<strong> the workouts set clear goals for pace, duration, and intensity</strong>.</p>



<p>The GPS tracking shows the <strong>exact distance, pace, and route using satellite positioning</strong> which is much more accurate than phone-based tracking that has to deal with power-saving problems and signal drops. The watch keeps track of your real path instead of using step counting algorithms that make mistakes when you turn or go up or down. After a run, maps show exact routes and color-coded pace analysis shows where you sped up or slowed down, revealing patterns that were hard to see during the run.</p>
<p>The <strong>two-week battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> means you don’t have to charge it every night, which makes fitness trackers feel like they need a lot of care and attention. Wear it all the time to keep track of all your activities and sleep without having to charge it every day. The GPS mode lasts for 20 hours, which is enough for ultra-distance events or several weeks of training between charges.</p>
<p>The <strong>PacePro feature gives you GPS-based pace advice for planned courses</strong> or target distances: It helps you plan your race day strategy by giving you personalized pacing that takes into account changes in elevation and how much energy you have. Enter your goal finish time, and the watch will figure out how much you need to change your pace for hills: This will help you keep up a steady effort that keeps you from getting too excited too soon and bonking late in the race.</p>



<p>The activity profile includes a wide <strong>range of running styles such as track and trail running, as well as cycling, swimming, HIIT, yoga, and strength training</strong>. This variety allows for cross-training, which is important for preventing injuries. The watch can tell when you’re moving in different ways and uses the right tracking algorithms to keep track of your pool swim laps and figure out your cycling cadence from your wrist movement.</p>
<p>Advanced wellness monitoring goes beyond just tracking workouts: It<strong> includes all-day heart rate and respiration tracking, sleep analysis, and Body Battery energy monitoring</strong>. Stress tracking shows how daily life affects recovery, and sleep scoring measures the quality of sleep by looking at movement and heart rate variability. The Body Battery metric combines information about your stress, activity, and sleep into a single energy score that can help you figure out when is the best time to work out.</p>
<p>At $149, Garmin’s entry-level running watch is the cheapest it’s ever been on Black Friday – and it’s cheaper than many basic fitness bands that don’t have GPS or structured training features. If you want to improve your running without spending four figures, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dyson’s Heater and Fan Combo Hits a 40% Black Friday Low, Practically a Christmas Gift for an All-Season Appliance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-just-slashed-its-hotcool-am09-jet-focus-heater-and-fan-by-200-practically-giving-it-away-2000648205</link>
            <guid>1367296</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter is here, and if you’re anything like me, a central heating system (and multiple layers of socks) won’t be enough to warm those hands and feet up. You need something with an amplified airflow for both personal and whole-room heating. The Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan does that job well, and its dual functionality makes it great for year-round use.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, like most other Dyson appliances, this one isn’t exactly the most affordable at $500, but thankfully, you don’t have to pay the full price today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">A 40% Black Friday discount has dropped the price to just $300, letting you save a whopping $200 for a short time.</a> The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime users, but it could end soon. Get this sleek fan while the discount is live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional for Year-Round Comfort</h2>
<p>The fan uses Air Multiplier technology to deliver an uninterrupted stream of smooth airflow in both hot and cool modes. In winter, the ceramic plates heat up quick to deliver the cozy warmth your body needs, while the amplified airflow cools you down fast in hot weather, making it great to use any time of the year; snow or shine.</p>
<p>There are two airflow modes to choose from; Jet Focus and Diffused. The former directs the air at you, so it’s great for when you want the warmth or breeze to yourself. Diffused mode, on the other hand, gently cools/heats the entire room by oscillating at a 70-degree angle. Just came in after spending time with friends on a chilly evening? Warm those freezing hands up with the Focus mode. Once your body temperature is back up, you can switch to Diffused mode for even warmth all around. Changing modes is quick, thanks to the included remote that attaches magnetically to the Dyson hot plus hot for easy storage.</p>



<p>Those planning to use it at night will appreciate the built-in sleep timer that automatically turns the thing off after pre-set intervals. These can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hours. Temperature ranges from 32°F to 98.6°F, meaning you won’t be stuck with a narrow range as with most traditional heaters and coolers. Before dozing off, set your ideal temperature, switch to the Diffused mode (unless you want to feel like you’re in the Sahara in winters or the North Pole in summers), and pick a timer setting. Taking a quick nap? 20 minutes should do. Calling it a day? Go ahead and set it for five or six hours. Since there are no blades involved, it operates fairly quietly, as well. Just note that it’s not cordless, so you’ll need to place it somewhere near an outlet.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a heating and cooling solution with different operating modes and a wide temperature range, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider. It provides you with the warmth and breeze you need, exactly how you want it to be delivered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">We recommend it even at its not-so-friendly $500 price tag, but the current $200 discount makes the upgrade quite affordable.</a> It’s also important to note that such massive drops tend to wrap up quickly, especially with the holiday rush kicking in. We highly suggest locking the discount in without wasting much time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[At $0.02 Per GB, WD 5TB My Passport External Hard Drive Leaves No Margin on the Table]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/backup-your-data-with-a-5tb-external-hard-drive-for-just-125-for-black-friday-2000647687</link>
            <guid>1367284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday here, tons of deals have now gone live across the web. If you’re trying to save some cash on some upgrades to your kitchen, some new toys, or some new tech, now’s the time to get shopping. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/">If you’re in need of more storage with your computer, Amazon has the WD 5TB My Passport Ultra external hard drive one sale for up to 19% off.</a> There are multiple size options to choose from, but the only ones part of the ongoing deal is the 2TB, the 4TB, and the 5TB. The 2TB has come down by $10 to just $80. The 4TB has come down by $15 to $125. However, the 5TB has come down by a significant $30 which also brings it to just $125. So there’s no reason to go with the 4TB right now as you can get an extra 1TB of storage for the same price.</p>
<p>This external hard drive is a great way to expand your device’s storage capacity quickly and easily. The My Passport Ultra can connect to your laptop or PC over USB-C. In order to ensure compatibility with older machines, a USB-A adapter is included.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The drive is made to be durable and travel friendly. It has a sleek exterior casing made from anodized metal, offering your stored data protection when on the go.</p>
<p>Do note that this is a hard drive, not a solid state drive. Western Digital doesn’t list the exact specs for read and write speeds of its My Passport Ultra external hard drive, but don’t expect it to compare to the speeds of some newer SSDs. If you’re someone who finds themselves working on massive creative projects like editing video, this likely won’t be sufficient for you. It can still provide utility as a backup for your projects, but I wouldn’t recommended working directly from it for big videos timelines.</p>
<p>Likewise, this hard drive isn’t meant for gaming. Modern AAA titles require some pretty fast load times, so you won’t have any luck trying to play games from this. It’s also not compatible with consoles, using it with your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It may work with older consoles, or even simply for game storage with the the current generation stuff. Some external hard drives are able to be formatted to store PS5 or Xbox Series X games, but require that you move them back to your internal storage in order to play them. Though, again, Western Digital makes no mention of gaming here on the product page so your mileage may vary with this one.</p>



<h2>Scheduled Backups</h2>
<p>It seems this drive is primarily geared toward those in need of some place to backup their files. The included Acronis True Image for Western Digital allows you to even schedule backups. You can just keep the hard drive plugged into your laptop or PC and have it backup your files at regularly scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>The hard driver is equipped with security features which help protect against ransomware. You can fortify your important applications and help prevent data loss from ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about someone malicious getting their hands on your files, or simply would feel a better peace of mind if no one could access but you. you can enable password protection at the hard drive level. You data will be locked behind a password of your choice with 256-bit AES hardware encryption.</p>
