              <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is keeping the lights on CD Projekt Red. The Polish studio confirmed the 2020 RPG is now its main source of revenue as the rags-to-riches blockbuster reaches 35 million sales before <em>The Witcher 3</em> did.</p> <p>CDPR revealed the new milestone in its latest earnings report. “That’s a better result than<em> The Witcher 3</em> was able to achieve in the same post-release time frame,” CFO Piotr Nielubowicz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ENiOGmcic">said</a>. That make it now the company’s “main source of income” as it staffs up on<a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198"><em> Cyberpunk 2</em></a>, whose development is split between teams in Warsaw and Boston.</p> <p>While about half of the company remains focused on shipping <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR plans to have over 300 developers working on the sci-fi sequel by the end of 2027, suggesting that year will mark an inflexion point as the studio pivots to the full production on the latter. At least if everything goes according to plan.</p>

 <p>While Cyberpunk is still almost half short of The Witcher 3’s 60 million all-time sales, its new record is impressive for a game whose launch was one of the most high-profile disasters in recent gaming history. Despite praise for the PC version, the console port, especially on last-gen consoles, led to viral bug montages, fan revolts, and investor freakouts.</p>

 <p>It’s not every day a game that was once pulled off of PSN by Sony becomes a company’s main cash cow. Much of that turnaround is owed to a series of massive patches and 2023’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion</a>.</p> <p>It’s no doubt also helped by a great Switch 2 port that arrived back in June. The five-year-old game runs great on Nintendo’s new hardware and gives millions of new players a chance to experience V’s tour through heaven and hell in Night City for them selves. Or anyone who played it years ago but still needs to go back and get the good ending. Thanks god for cross-save!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/account-behind-viral-ai-gta-6-bait-claims-it-was-just-a-joke-2000647720</link>
            <guid>1365943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t worry, guys, that viral video featuring a fake <em>GTA 6</em> leak that was swiftly identified as AI was all a social experiment! Doesn’t that automatically make the continued, extreme blurring between reality and AI-generated junk a bit better, because in this case, it was done to prove a point? No? Dang.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-leak-fake-ai-youtube-google-2000647395">Yesterday, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s Ethan Gach opined on</a> how the demand for news about Rockstar’s long-awaited, repeatedly delayed game, coupled with the increasing ease with which your neighbor Bob can “create” pictures and videos with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, has made for a fake footage nightmare.</p>

 <p>On November 25, a verified Twitter/X account named <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/">ZapActu GTA6</a> issued an “EXTREMELY SERIOUS SITUATION” alert on the platform and shared allegedly leaked footage that appeared to show <em>GTA 6</em> protagonist Lucia walking around in the upcoming game’s open world. The video, reportedly first shared on TikTok, showed off a “dynamic weather system unlike anything seen in&nbsp;<em>GTA V”&nbsp;</em>and “shockingly lifelike NPCs” and a “level of realism” that was quite frankly astounding because it was all fake. The post sharing the video has since been deleted.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-creator-of-viral-gta-6-gameplay-leak-video-insists-it-was-an-experiment-designed-to-show-how-easy-it-has-become-to-blur-the-line-between-reality-and-ai-generated-content"><em>IGN</em> reports</a> that Zap Actu GTA6’s Discord was buzzing with backlash after the fake footage leak, prompting them to issue a statement. They claimed the AI-generated <em>GTA 6</em> videos were created “to observe people’s reactions and to demonstrate how easy it has become in 2025 to blur the line between reality and AI-generated content.” They also said there were no “bad intentions” when they created and shared the fake videos.</p>

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My intention was never to harm anyone. I simply wanted to create something intriguing that could bring people together and spark discussion within the GTA 6 community. I genuinely never expected a single video to generate such massive engagement and reach.</p> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In a much less apologetic message to <em>IGN</em>, Zap Actu said,&nbsp;“It was a huge joke actually, I did it just to entertain the community. Sorry for the false hope lol.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The “I was doing the bad thing to shine light on the bad thing” excuse is one human beings have been using for years (and the same one I used when my parents found a box of candy wrappers under my bed a week before Halloween 1999). It’s hard to believe someone who has dedicated a huge chunk of their internet presence to monitoring <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> news would have “never expected a single video to generate such massive engagement and reach,” especially considering the lack of concrete&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>news over the last decade.</p>

 <p data-cy="paragraph">Though Zap Actu claims they made no money from sharing the fake&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em> leaks, they do have an active “X Premium” account. Those who subscribe to the X Premium get a blue check next to their name and are eligible for monetization if they have at least 500 verified followers (Zap Actu has over 4,000, though it’s unclear how many are verified), have at least 5 million organic impressions in the last three months, and are in a supported country (Zap Actu’s account states it’s based in France).</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, as more and more AI content gets heaped onto the mostly unregulated slop pile that is Twitter, we should expect to encounter more fake <em>GTA 6</em> content that can easily pass as real. What a reality we live in!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Fans Just Made Magic: The Gathering Do Something Unprecedented]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-mtg-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-superdrop-2000647703</link>
            <guid>1365883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Secret Lair x <em>Monster Hunter</em> drop was revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251121083502/https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-monster-hunter-superdrop">just last week</a>. It featured a number of characters and creatures from the hit Capcom multiplayer series and a Sol Ring promo card in each drop. But fans were not impressed. The card selection for the reprints was criticized for being uninspired and having nothing to do with the series it was drawing from. In fact, the fan reaction was so loud <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">that Wizards of the Coast</a> has done something completely unexpected: take the Secret Lair drop back to the drawing board.</p> <p>“We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better,” the company <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter">announced on Wednesday</a>. “We’re going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.” Wizards admitted it “missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of <em>Monster Hunter</em> and plans to rework the Superdrop in the meantime. Details on the new set won’t be re-revealed until next year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We care a lot about the worlds we get to celebrate, and Secret Lair x Monster Hunter didn’t quite come together the way it should have. We hear you, so we’re heading back to the drawing board to rework this Superdrop. More to come.<a href="https://t.co/dtHublSB13">https://t.co/dtHublSB13</a> <a href="https://t.co/yMkaUPaUWI">pic.twitter.com/yMkaUPaUWI</a></p> <p>— MTG Secret Lair (@MTGSecretLair) <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1993726445193990451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Players had three main complaints about the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter collaboration. The first was that the card selection was pretty bland and not aligned with the series’ lore. Valstrax, the silver Elder Dragon, was <a href="https://x.com/TheTrinketMage/status/1990867324048421298">a Sol Ring</a>&nbsp;despite being neither an artifact nor a ring. Some took issue with the color selection for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1p0lerg/official_magic_the_gathering_x_monster_hunter/">various references</a>, as well as the card art.</p>

 <p>The general bewilderment was best encapsulated by the Champion of Kotoko card, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1p0i9dq/monster_hunter_secret_lair_champion_of_kotoko/">misspelled Kokoto</a>, the village from the very first Monster Hunter game. It didn’t help that many of the reprinted cards had a second-hand market value well below the $30 and $40 Superdrops.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Upon further inspection some of the Monster Hunter x Magic The Gathering cards don't look too good</p> <p>Velkhana and Malzeno especially look a bit weird, like they had their face smoothed.</p> <p>Yuan Garuga also looks goofy and then there's Champion Of "Kotoko" <a href="https://t.co/bbyOFVHpUG">pic.twitter.com/bbyOFVHpUG</a></p> <p>— DarkHero (@DarkHeroCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkHeroCC/status/1991154721541722419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One MTG YouTuber summed up the response with a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NASy37-CGaE">The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Sucks</a>.”</p> <p>Now that Wizards is redoing the set from scratch, some fans are hopeful it might just go the route of making completely unique cards rather than picking other card reprints to tag with new<em> Monster Hunter</em> names and art. Or Wizards could bring back the “craft” mechanic from<em> Lost Caverns of Ixalan,</em> given <em>MonHon</em>‘s emphasis on creatures and equipment. There have also been requests for Capcom’s own artists to contribute to the illustrations.</p> <p>Whatever the revised Secret Lair Superdrop ends up being, Wizards says not to get used to this sort of reversal. “Pulling Superdrops back isn’t something we’re going to do very often, but we’re committed to doing better,” the company wrote today. “Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>has always been a chaotic, competitive game of sensory overload. Developer NetEase is deciding to lean further into that by giving the hero shooter a mode that triples the number of players on screen at once. Happy first anniversary, heroes.</span></p> <p><span>The 18v18 Annihilation mode is exactly what it sounds like. The 36-player mode pits two teams that are three times the size of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-dog-healer-twitch-streamer-2000647271"><span>your usual </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>stack</span></a><span> against one another and crosses its fingers that your PC and console can handle it. I’m thinking of all the technically demanding attacks and effects in this game, and wondering what happens if you have 36 players using them at the same time. Will your PS5 crash if 36 Doctor Strange players open portals up on one map? We’ll find out tomorrow when the mode goes live.</span></p>

  <p><span>Funnily enough, you could have an 18v18 match made up entirely of different heroes with the game’s expansive roster, though the trailer shows some match-ups of multiple of the same character, like a fight of mostly players waddling around as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962"><span>Jeff the Land Shark</span></a><span>. With this many heroes on the field at once, any characters with big, game-changing area-of-effect moves are going to thrive, I will say, seeing Star-Lord auto-aiming with his ultimate as a crowd of helpless enemies’ health bars ticked down did scratch an itch in my brain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Will this be what gets me back into </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>? Probably not. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>and I worked out our differences</span></a><span>, and I’ve got a battle pass to complete. I doubt this mode is going to become the go-to competitive play style for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>players, but it will probably give them something fun to do for a few weeks before everyone inevitably goes back to playing the standard 6v6 format. I look forward to seeing the crazy clips of shenanigans players pull off.</span></p> <p><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>just entered its fifth season, which added Gambit to the roster. Rogue will join the fray during the mid-season update next month.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Longtime English studio <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-canceled-splash-damage-layoffs-1851735308">Splash Damage</a> is facing an uncertain future as it begins a consultation process that will affect all staff and likely lead to layoffs.</p> <p>On November 26, Splash Damage publicly announced online that the studio was entering a “studio-wide consultation process” that would involve all employees across all roles and disciplines. This follows the London-based studio being acquired in September by a private equity investor after being sold by its previous owner, Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>“This was a difficult step for us to take,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">Splash Damage via a message shared on LinkedIn</a>. “But we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We’re committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.”</p>

 <p>Splash Damage already suffered layoffs earlier this year after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122"><em>Transformers</em> game it was working on was canceled</a>. The last game the studio shipped was 2020’s <em>Outcasters</em> for Google’s now-defunct Stadia game streaming service. Before that, the studio, which was formed in 2001, had developed various popular multiplayer games, including <em>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink,</em> and helped Xbox as a support studio on <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> titles. It also developed <em>Gears of War Tactics.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It is the latest round of bad news for the video game industry as developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs">continue to be laid off and studios closed as publishers tighten their belts</a> and begin<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251"> investing more into AI generation tools</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Souls + Morrowind + The Doom Engine = One Of 2025’s Coolest Shooters]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667</link>
            <guid>1365829</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In first-person shooters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">especially older games or retro-inspired boomer shooters</a>, the first gun you get tells you a lot about the game. And in <em>Mohrta</em>, your first weapon is a powerful, accurate, hard-hitting revolver that makes the<a href="https://youtu.be/jRrommJ5V9w"> famous M1-Garand “ping” noise</a> every time you reload it. This is just one of the many reasons why I adore <em>Mohrta,</em> which is out now on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"><em>Mohrta</em>, which launched last month</a>, is a non-linear first-person shooter built in GZDoom that has big <em>Morrowind</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> vibes. And yes, I know mentioning<em> Dark Souls</em> in a blog or article about video games risks mockery,&nbsp; but the way this game’s save shrines work and the pacing of each of the worlds you visit, plus its challenging boss fights, create <em>very </em>similar vibes to a FromSoftware RPG. Except you have a shotgun. <a href="https://youtu.be/e_HT14h35eg">Wait, actually, FromSoftware did that, actually</a>. Huh…anyway, I mentioned <em>Morrowind</em> because <em>Mohtra’s</em> strange dark fantasy universe has similar aesthetics to Bethesda’s popular RPG, too. But again, with more guns.</p>

  <p>In <em>Mohrtra</em>, you play as an undead knight-like machine-man who is determined to clean up all the nasty, strange creatures and oddities infesting the land while tracking down someone important. To save the lands and find this person, you’ll need to explore various worlds that ramp up in difficulty, but which can be completed in any order you desire. You start with a powerful sword and badass revolver and grow your arsenal with a shotgun, a bizarre grenade launcher, an SMG that fires bones, and some other really odd weapons I won’t spoil here. All of the weapons feel great, and because the game is built in GZDoom, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-gzdoom-source-port-graf-zahl-ai-chatgpt-2000636055">a modern source port of id’s classic ’90s FPS</a>, gameplay feels snappy, fast, and punchy.</p>

 <p>You also have a small talking doll that can heal you and a vulture on your shoulder that provides light when exploring dark caverns or ruins. <em>Mohtra</em> is weird if you haven’t got that yet. But I love it. Returning from levels to the large market hub world is always a treat. The strange denizens of this world are always willing to chat and trade with you, letting you upgrade your gear and guns, making future missions in new worlds easier.</p>

 <p>All of this is drenched in gorgeous retro-inspired textures and effects. Forests are foggy and gloomy. Lava-filled caves are dark and foreboding. Ancient ruins look deserted and lonely. Immaculate vibes going in this one. <a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067">Who needs 4K raytracing when you got the <em>Doom</em> engine?</a></p> <p>If you are craving a five-to-seven-hour oddball boomer shooter that isn’t just about running through corridors and killing soldiers or zombies,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"> I’d hop over to Steam and check out <em>Mohtra</em></a>, one of the best FPS games released this year. And tell me how you think <em>Mohtra</em> is pronounced.&nbsp; I’ve been saying “mow-CH-ru.” But I heard someone say “MAHT-ra.” I don’t know, I’m too busy shooting creepy skeleton men with my bone gun to worry about that kind of stuff.</p>
