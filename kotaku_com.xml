            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Third-party games often struggle on Nintendo platforms. Not <em>Madden NFL 26</em>. The first EA football game to grace one of the Mario maker’s consoles in over a decade, it’s already taking over the top of the Switch 2 sales charts, with its $100 Deluxe Edition bundle second only to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. But how does it play? New <em>Madden</em> entries have fraught receptions, even on the most powerful consoles. Last year’s version has 3.2 user rating on Metacritic. Apparently the Switch 2 version of Madden 26 successfully carried over that part of the franchise’s legacy. Fans are already divided on whether the port is a dream come true or hot garbage. And some are begging for refunds. Could it really be that bad?</p> <p>I haven’t played the game on Switch 2 yet myself (<em>Kotaku</em> received review code on PS5) but I have been monitoring day-one impressions as they roll in (early access began August 7 but the full launch isn’t until August 14). <em>NintendoLife</em> praised the port in its review. <em>“</em><em>Madden 26</em> on Switch 2 is absolutely a triumph in most regards,” writes PJ O’Reilly. “It plays well, it runs decently, and it looks not too far removed from other console versions.” He notes that the problems he has encountered like “existing menu issues, long loading times, and/or a persistent issue that’s locking me out of <em>Madden 26</em> because the servers are busy” are present across both platforms at the moment. Per usual, the paid early access period is more of a paid beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dude yeah, it’s not optimized. We need frame rate improvements it’s nearly unplayable</p> <p>— Jeremiah Krakowski (@JeremyKrak) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKrak/status/1953520199862227228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So, what to make of some players raging about things like apparent input lag and framerate stuttering on Switch 2, where it hovers above 30fps but doesn’t hit 60fps like on the other platforms? “Submit your refund asap for Switch 2. Game is unplayable,” reads<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk717v/submit_your_refund_asap_for_switch_2_game_is/"> one of the more dire warnings</a> on the <em>Madden</em> subreddit. The player in question, WhatIsGodWithoutOD, was seemingly able to extract a refund out of Nintendo according to a screenshot. “PSA&nbsp;: Avoid Madden on Switch2–at least for now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk7acf/psa_avoid_madden_on_switch2_at_least_for_now/">reads another</a> thread by a player lamenting “insanely low frame drops.” The comments sections in both posts, however, include players reporting perfectly fine play sessions with the game.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VnHtNs_Hbs">Direct capture of <em>Madden 26</em></a> running on Switch 2 shows the frequent stuttering some players are talking about, but overall the resolution and performance seems decent enough for a PS5 and Xbox Series X/S game running on a handheld hybrid (this year’s entry is also the first to leave PS4 and Xbox One behind). “It’s a solid port overall although it could be better, and it’s still a very fun experience especially on the go,” wrote one especially level-headed player on the Switch 2 subreddit. So far at least, it sounds like the real divide is over the lack of a 60fps mode. Fans coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S <a href="https://x.com/JuniThePuny/status/1953492620937699745">might find the difference jarring</a>. Nintendo fans coming to the series for the first time in years seem to be finding it good enough so far, though there are some questions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mky5gt/did_ea_lie_about_switch_2_feature_parity/">discrepancies in half-time shows and other features</a> between the different versions.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Madden on Switch 2 is not 60fps but the game still plays good!  Cant explain it, but it’s definitely smoother than 30fps too.  I have about two hours of gameplay here on X and YouTube you can see for yourself.  Definitely would recommend the game!  Here is a clip of a pick 6… <a href="https://t.co/6yHIhQhrgd">pic.twitter.com/6yHIhQhrgd</a></p> <p>— OBE1plays YouTube (@OBE1plays) <a href="https://twitter.com/OBE1plays/status/1953533129655722051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>For those who are playing <em>Madden 26</em> on Switch 2, fans are already circulating two urban legend fixes to help make the experience go smoother. These tricks&nbsp;<em>might</em> be legitimate, or they might simply be the modern day placebo analogues to blowing in the cartridge. The first is making sure the game is installed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk8lb9/switch_2_moving_game_to_internal_storage/">Switch 2’s internal memory</a> instead of being read of a cartridge or sitting on the Micro SD express card. The second is doing a hard reboot of the game and system if performance starts to get especially funky. At least until EA starts patching the game, some players are already resorting to turning it off and on again.</p> <p>Otherwise, the early access period is a good time to wait and let Madden 26 begin sorting itself out, a now familiar pattern to annual <em>Madden</em> obsessives. There will be the round of rushed fixes, fans saying, “Actually this entry is pretty great,” and then the mid-fall slump when the nagging issues come back to dominate the conversation. Any real movement in the franchise or player base will be marginal, at least <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-will-make-nfl-games-again-for-the-first-time-in-16-y-1842235385">until 2K releases its own football game</a> and there is finally some competition in the space again. But you don’t have to actually play <em>Madden</em> to enjoy the best part about each new release: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mkafrj/classic_ea/">a fresh season of glitches</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> was a wildly successful sequel to one of the Nintendo Switch’s most popular games, so an upgraded version on Nintendo Switch 2 was a no-brainer. The upgrade promises improved visuals, performance, HDR support, and more; arguably, there is no better way to experience this gorgeous open-world adventure. But how does the original version run on new hardware <i>without </i>the upgrade? Let’s discuss. We’ll also get into some helpful tips for getting started in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i>.</p>  <p>Say you’ve got a copy of <i>Tears of the Kingdom </i>on hand, but are short the $10 needed for the upgrade. Fortunately, the first Switch edition of <i>TotK</i> is the same, incredible game many of us fell in love with in 2023. Yes, the resolution is lower, the load times are slower, but it remains one of Link’s greatest adventures yet.</p> <p>Without the upgrade, <i>TotK</i> will still only run at 30 frames-per-second on Switch 2. That said, the framerate is more stable, so you’ll have a slightly better experience than what you’d get on aging, OG Switch hardware.</p>

 <p>As has been <a href="https://youtu.be/XtdaeX_fGHI">well documented by this point</a>, the Switch 2 upgrade is a dramatic improvement. The game looks sharper, it runs at double the framerate, and load times have been cut in half. Also, the Zelda Notes are an excellent dose of extra lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zelda Totk switch 2 UPGRADE vs ORIGINAL edition LOADING comparison" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBBtcxdv2mg"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;Unless you’re running on a super tight budget, we wholeheartedly recommend spending the extra 10 bucks to enjoy this masterpiece. Now, let’s get to some helpful tips for those jumping off a Sky Island for the very first time.</p> <hr> <h2><span id="tips-for-tears-of-the-kingdom-newcomers"></span>Tips for <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i> newcomers<span></span></h2>  <h3><span id="make-a-beeline-for-the-paraglider"></span>Make a beeline for the paraglider<span></span></h3> <p>Anyone who has played <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> will remember the paraglider being an immensely important part of Link’s kit, helping him glide around and reach new spots. It’s only more vital in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </i>due to the game’s heavier focus on sky exploration, so don’t accidentally start exploring too much of Hyrule before getting your hands on it. Luckily, you just need to follow the first few hours of the main quest to score the paraglider, so you’ll be gliding in no time at all.</p>

 <h3><span id="level-stamina-before-hearts"></span>Level stamina before hearts<span></span></h3> <p>Enemies in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> hit hard as hell, with some baddies being able to one-shot you handily during the first half of the game even if you have a few extra hearts. With this in mind, it’s a good idea to prioritize leveling your stamina as much as possible early on. This will let you do a lot more climbing and gliding, which is very important for reaching new areas or shrines with exciting loot.</p> <p>You can always cook and eat meals that give you extra hearts if you really need them. And after making a little more progress in the game, you’ll be able to respec your hearts and stamina for 120 rupees at a particular statue in Lookout Landing, so you’ll be able to change things up as you see fit.</p>

 <h3><span id="fuse-a-lot-of-makeshift-hammers-and-keep-them-handy"></span>Fuse a lot of makeshift hammers and keep them handy<span></span></h3> <p>This may seem like a niche tip, but keeping makeshift hammers around is one of the most helpful things you can do for yourself in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</i> You’ll find yourself exploring numerous deep caves in Hyrule, and you’ll be shocked at how many contain multiple pathways blocked by breakable rocks.</p> <p>Though you may be able to use bomb plants or other methods to clear rock blockages, hammer weapons, which you can make by fusing a normal weapon with a rock/boulder (or certain other hard materials), allow you to attack specific pieces of the blockage to carve a path just big enough for you to fit through. Even better, breaking the blockage will sometimes spawn new rocks you can use to fuse a brand-new makeshift hammer!</p>

 <p>You’ll find a more efficient way to break these walls later in the game–but until then, keep fusing!</p> <h3><span id="trust-your-own-ingenuity"></span>Trust your own ingenuity<span></span></h3> <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </i>goes big on the Ultrahand ability, which lets you combine various items in the world to create everything from simple platforms to intricate machines. And if you’re going to solve every puzzle and reach every well-hidden secret in Hyrule, you’ll need to master this ability.</p> <p>While you may encounter some puzzles or hard-to-reach-items here and there that have only one or two building solutions, a significant portion of these scenarios can benefit from your ingenuity. So, feel free to opt for a complex device or even a sloppy, half-assed solution of your own choosing. You’d be surprised at how often your own random building ideas can get the job done–sometimes even easier than the solutions the developers intended for you to use.</p> <p>Ultrahand doesn’t control you—you control Ultrahand.</p> <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> is available now for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>BANG! One moment, I was running down a dusty street in Cairo; the next moment, I was on my ass, bleeding out. Someone had shot me. A few teammates near me fired into the building where my attacker was and killed him. Lying on the ground, I watched them reload their rifles, look around for other enemies, and then…they just ran off, leaving me to die in the street. They could have revived me, but they didn’t. Instead, I had to respawn and burn one of our conquest tickets. It was annoying, and it keeps happening in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 7, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-huge-player-count-steam-beta-jurassic-forza-castle-crashers-2000616307"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a> launched on consoles and PC. However, for now can only play if you have an early access code, as the beta doesn’t go fully open until August 9. It’s weird to gatekeep an “open” beta, but whatever. Since it launched on Thursday, I’ve been squeezing in as many matches of Conquest and Breakthrough as I can and having a great time. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I really enjoyed EA’s upcoming military shooter</a> when I played it <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">earlier this month at a big event in Los Angeles</a>, and I still like <em>BF6</em> now that I’m playing it at home. The gunplay is tight and responsive, everything sounds dangerous, explosions are incredible, and the maps are big, but not too big. Good shit. But what isn’t good is how frequently people don’t revive me or others when we’re down. Instead, they just run by or stand near me and do nothing. Please, stop ignoring your downed comrades and help them out.</p> <p>You might be thinking, “Well, if they aren’t medics, they can’t help you.” But that’s not how <em>Battlefield 6</em> works. In this game, anyone can revive a downed soldier by running up to them, holding a specific button, and dragging them to safety. After a few seconds of holding onto the injured player, they’ll be revived with partial health. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385">It’s a wonderful mechanic</a> that has already led to some incredible moments with friends while playing the beta. And I’m always willing to drag a random player to safety and bring them back into the fight as it’s fun, useful, and doesn’t take too long.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Sadly, most other players either don’t realize that anyone can drag and revive players, or don’t care to help. Worse, I see plenty of people playing the Support class, which has access to defib paddles that can instantly revive people, and they also ignore me and my friends. Why are you playing the medic-themed class that is built around helping people if you just run by all your downed teammates? It’s incredibly annoying and has led to my team losing matches because we keep respawning to get back into the action instead of reviving, and that burns through our respawn tickets in modes like Conquest. It also makes it harder for me to revive people because so many players just instantly respawn the moment they die, as they assume, understandably, that nobody is going to help them. Why waste time waiting for help that is unlikely to come? That leads to the team burning through tickets even faster. It’s all very frustrating.</p> <p>Look, I don’t expect to be revived every single time I go down. Sometimes I’m too far away from others. Sometimes there’s a fucking tank next to me. I’m not expecting people to throw themselves into danger just to revive me. But it would be nice if I didn’t have to bleed out slowly in a building filled with teammates simply because nobody grabbed me and helped. So, I ask you all, during the open beta and when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches later this October, to please, please, please revive people more. You’ll feel better, they’ll be happy, and your team won’t burn a ticket. Everyone wins. Doesn’t that sound nice?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-netflix-animated-stream-1851785935"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> is </span><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/top-10-reports/can-kpop-demon-hunters-topple-red-notice-plus-debuts-of-leanne-and-my-oxford-year-netflix-top-10-report/"><span>projected to possibly become Netflix’s most-streamed movie ever</span></a><span> in the coming weeks, and for good reason. The animated action musical is a visual feast that’s already made its way to </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>the #4 spot on Netflix’s all-time list</span></a><span>, buoyed by an incredible KPop soundtrack by fictional groups Huntr/x and Saja Boys that is topping the charts in the music world. That collection of original songs has been one of the major draws for the film, but how do those songs compare to one another? Some songs are elevated (or, in other cases, hindered) by their placement in the movie, but in a musical, no song is ever </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> a song. It’s a moment in a story crystallized and encapsulated in its most uninhibited form. So even if a song doesn’t quite hit the same way others do, that very feeling of something being off or the characters not quite giving it their all is very likely a storytelling tool in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>. We’re going to examine each of these numbers within that context and rank all seven of its original songs.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“Takedown”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Huntrix - Takedown (Lyrics) KPop Demon Hunters" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7P-ODFkHd5Y?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Hey, hey, hey. We just started. Put the tomatoes away until the end, please. “Takedown” is a fan favorite (let’s be honest, most of the songs are fan favorites because they’re all bangers), but when the song’s entire narrative meaning in the film is that the girls are decidedly unenthusiastic about the diss track, it’s not too surprising that it’s one of Huntr/x’s weaker works. It oozes attitude and grit, but even when it comes to those vibes, the song is pretty markedly outclassed by another song that blew the roof off at the beginning of the movie. Even when I was rewatching the film and hearing the girls brainstorm its lyrics without any of the backing music, I just didn’t feel that the group’s heart was in it like it is in all the other numbers. It’s an effective storytelling tool, but it doesn’t translate to one of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ better</span> <span>songs.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“Soda Pop”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Soda Pop&quot; Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/983bBbJx0Mk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Saja Boys’ debut single is, as Mira says while the demon boy band is performing it for the first time, “infectious.” It’s the most straightforward bubblegum pop song in the movie, and the group’s flirtatious sex appeal cranks its cutesy wordplay up to something that would have all the girls and gays losing their goddamn minds in an arena show. The Saja Boys mostly end up being extensions of Jinu’s plans throughout the movie, but “Soda Pop” is the one time it feels like all five members really get to express their individual personalities, from Baby Saja getting to rap to Romance having a…well, romantic, lilting singing tone that gets put on display in the pre-chorus. The whole thing is, on its face, the kind of chart-topping hit that brings a new boy band outfit into the spotlight, but it all hides an insidious undertone, as it talks about the audience as something to be consumed. That’s foreshadowing, baby.</span></p>

 <h2><b>“Golden”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="“Golden” Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yebNIHKAC4A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Ah, I see the tomatoes are out once again. Look, all these songs are great. “Golden,” easily the breakout song for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>based on chart and streaming numbers, is a gorgeous vocal showcase for lead singer Rumi, who absolutely soars as she sings of self-acceptance and her and her girls overcoming adversity to be their truest selves…only to take on a much more introspective, reserved tone in the bridge. As she privately whispers to herself about her own demonic patterns that she’s hidden from her friends and the world, “Golden” becomes a surprisingly subversive anthem that sets the tone for the entire film. It’s great! But it had some tough competition in this ranking.</span></p> <h2><b>“Your Idol”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Your Idol&quot; | Official Song Clip | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWppAbqm9I8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>The Saja Boys’ second song, “Your Idol,” is a masterful mask-off moment. The demonic group has shed their boy-band disguise and is presenting to an audience of brainwashed fans as their true, hellish selves. Gone are the neon color palettes of the Saja Boys’ original costumes; they’re now dressed in traditional Korean garb with their demonic patterns exposed for all the world to see. If that weren’t enough of an indicator that everything has gone awry, the song’s haunting Latin chant in the opening portends a world completely overtaken by the demon king and his musical lackeys. Even as the song shifts into an absolutely filthy industrial pop beat, the choir still chants underneath the Saja Boys’ singing as they beckon the helpless crowd into the mouth of the demon king. Jinu and his demon crew still put on a seductive show, but their violent intention is no longer masked behind boyish good looks. It’s a harrowing song that’s also an absolute banger.</span></p> <h2><b>“How It’s Done”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;How It's Done&quot; Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGsevnbItdU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>“Takedown” is billed as </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ diss track, but “How It’s Done,” the opening number that introduces Huntr/x’s demon-hunting musical talents, is so superior as a showcase of the girls’ attitude, lyricism, and their status as pro-level haters, that it takes the wind out of the other song’s sails. “How It’s Done” and the opening sequence set to it make for such an incredible tone-setter for the whole film that it’s a feat in and of itself that the movie manages to live up to it across the rest of its runtime. It’s a barrage of nasty reads, fierce wordplay, and infectious swagger set to incredible demon-slaying choreography. Every beat, bar, and change in flow has a corresponding strike, stab, or bludgeon as the girls rock a bunch of demons’ shit while rapping and singing about how these foes are just cannon fodder, roaches to be crushed under their heels while they get ready to perform for thousands of adoring fans. Then these absolute queens </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>dive onto the stage while skysurfing on their enemies’ ragdolling bodies and making sure their makeup and hair are just right. If you came into </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>even vaguely unconvinced it would have the sauce, Huntr/x silences any doubts with “How It’s Done.” God, that shit rules.</span></p>

 <h2><b>“Free”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Free&quot; | Official Lyric Video | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjOeJssZX_Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>I think “Free” is the best animated musical love song since “A Whole New World” from </span><i><span>Aladdin</span></i><span>. I know that’s a bold statement, but Rumi and Jinu’s lone duet in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is such a lovely vocal showcase for both singers, and by god, I feel my soul lift from my body every time the chorus hits. “Free” is </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>at its most restrained, and even then, it is head and shoulders above the best most movie musicals have to offer as a vocal showcase for its leads. The ballad is a beautiful admission from two warring parties that they can dream of a life beyond the ones they’ve been told they have to have, and maybe, if they can find a way, they can reach that life together. Rumi’s singing is as gorgeous as ever, but one of the most surprising aspects is Jinu’s rap-like verse that manages to fit surprisingly well into a song that, up until that point, had been a pretty straightforward ballad. The song builds so well, utilizing both singers’ strengths in a way that makes it feel like the two are crafting it together, making space for one another’s talents as well as all their faults. Goddamn, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>knows how to tell a story in songwriting just as well as it does in lyricism.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“What It Sounds Like”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="“What It Sounds Like” Song Clip | KPop Demon Hunters | Netflix Family" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ug_pv5-r1js?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>A good musical can live or die by its closing number. By the time </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> reaches “What It Sounds Like,” it’s already had six good to incredible songs, and it somehow has to leave on a note that wraps up its story, sums up everything its characters have learned, and is also an incredible group performance that manages to be at least on par with everything it’s already done. “What It Sounds Like” does all of that so effortlessly that I’m still kind of in awe of it. You know what I do when I’m not listening to “What It Sounds Like”? I’m watching people react to it and making sure I’m not the only person who cries his eyes out as Huntr/x, having been torn apart and nearly lost to demonic influence, sing their apologies to one another as they fight their way through an army of demon spawn. The audience watches on, singing with them, and empowering the group to keep fighting, and eventually, they win the day.</span></p> <p><span>Much of Rumi’s inner struggle in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is in the self-imposed restraints she’s put on herself after being told for her whole life that she was a mistake to be corrected. It’s why her heart isn’t in the anti-demon sentiment of “Takedown.” It’s why “Golden” has to have an aside in which she gets to talk about what she’s actually feeling before she goes back out on stage to sing about the joys of being herself. “What It Sounds Like” is an anthemic summation of everything she and the rest of Huntr/x should have been doing this entire time. Rather than hiding everything from each other and the public and pretending to be perfect to write a song they couldn’t believe in, they’re putting it all on the line for one final, world-saving song that reflects who they truly are, rather than who they’ve been told they should be.</span></p> <p><span>“The song we couldn’t write, this is what it sounds like.”</span></p>

              <p>Did Tencent just stealthily try to walk itself back from the brink after getting sued by Sony for trying to rush a <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">brazen ripoff of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> to market? Will the PlayStation 6 be Sony’s least important console yet? And do we finally have our first real clue as to when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will come out? Welcome to the latest Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news, trailers, and other fascinating curios, like how the proprietor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw">Mom’s Spaghetti</a> is totally chill with being known as “<a href="https://twitter.com/Shadyind/status/1953257598129717757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953257598129717757%7Ctwgr%5E7f954647bca4ad74de71348ad09444d1288fa6ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwatch-eminem-react-to-being-called-that-guy-from-fortnite%2F1100-6533781%2F">The guy from <em>Fortnite</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Tencent tries to pretend the <em>Light of Motiram</em> never happened</h2> <p>The Chinese conglomerate was recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163">sued by Sony,</a> who alleged that Tencent kept trying to license <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> for a survival crafting game and, when Sony kept saying no, turned around and made it anyway. A week later, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/"><em>The Game Post</em> noticed</a> that developer Polaris Quest has quietly been changing out the worst offending images, language, and key art from the game’s Steam page.&nbsp;References to “colossal machines” and “Mechanimals” were stripped from the description and the screenshots and art now focus on generic scenes instead of <em>Light of Motiram</em>‘s Temu version of Aloy. Now that Sony has called Tencent’s bluff, it’ll probably continue to strip out the most egregious <em>Horizon</em> copycat elements from the game. We’ll see if that’s enough to get the PS5 maker to settle.</p> <h2>Sony is moving away from a “hardware centric business model” ahead of the PS6</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony Senior Vice President Sadahiko Hayakawa says they are gradually shifting their gaming business from a hardware centric business model to a community and engagement based platform business model <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a></p> <p>“In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric… <a href="https://t.co/8xnKyihMHE">pic.twitter.com/8xnKyihMHE</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The console war is grinding to an end. With <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on PlayStation and<em> Helldivers 2</em> coming to Xbox, the old rivalries are slowly, if not completely, fading into the background. “In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement,” senior Sony VP Sadahiko Hayakawa said this week. While in line with the company’s previous comments about focusing more on total players and engagement time over unit sales, the remark still raised eyebrows as the PS5 continues to dominate. Former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment of America Shawn Layden responded with a GIF of <em>God of War</em>‘s Kratos <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1953706271594397696">putting his head in his hands</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Xbox Rog Ally release date may have just leaked</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs poster billbil-kun</a>, the new PC gaming handhelds aiming to deliver Xbox-like console experiences will come out in Europe on October 16. Neither the date nor the price of the upcoming hardware has been officially revealed yet, though billbil-kun previously claimed it would cost €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the more powerful Xbox Ally X in Europe. We’ll have to wait and see how those prices translate to the U.S. amid Trump’s current tariff war.</p> <h2>A very convincing theory for<em> Silksong</em>‘s possible release date</h2> <p>Xbox fans will remember that Microsoft used <em>Silksong</em> to hype the Xbox Rog Ally reveal back during its Xbox summer showcase. The most wishlisted game on Steam would be “available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year,” Xbox president Sarah Bond said at the time. Based on this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/we-might-actually-have-a-tenuous-silksong-release-date-absolutely-nobody-on-my-team-believes-me-and-i-think-i-can-hear-hornet-in-my-walls/"><em>PC Gamer</em>‘s Harvey Randall</a> speculates that, if the October 16 leak is accurate, that could also be <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch date. That day is also a Thursday, which is when most new Switch 1 and Switch 2 games come out. Hmmm. Or maybe Bond simply meant that <em>Silksong</em> would already be out by the time the Xbox ROG Ally arrives, which, if that’s the case, is even better!</p> <h2><em>Ashes of the Singularity 2</em> is happening</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ashes of the Singularity II  |  Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The real-time strategy game known for its massive armies will return with a sequel nearly a decade later, this time with a human faction. There’s no release date yet and my current PC will just barely be able to run it but as a huge fan of<em> Total Annihilation</em>, one of the series’ influences, I can’t wait.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo’s next Switch 2 exclusive has a free player test this weekend</h2> <p>There is already a <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> demo on the eShop players can try for free, but there will also be an online playtest this weekend.
