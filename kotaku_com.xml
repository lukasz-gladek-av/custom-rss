Whether it’s a Bone Pile or a monster’s body, pressing Circle/B will have your hunter lean over to get an item.</p><p><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has more controls than your controller has buttons</strong></p><p>You don’t have to keep monotonously pressing the button for this interaction. <strong>Keep holding down the gather button to make your hunter continue collecting until there is nothing left.</strong> You’re not saving much time, but it feels better than pressing the button three to four times.</p><h2 id="h26187"><a id="3"></a>Slingers can still be shot with weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-recommend-id="image://3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Gypceros is hit by a slinger from a Sword and Shield-wearing Hunter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Gypceros is hit by a slinger from a Sword and Shield-wearing Hunter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-recommend-id="image://3649044b9c7c47edbb2680efb04e5f9a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Gypceros is hit by a slinger from a Sword and Shield-wearing Hunter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your slinger is one of the most useful tools in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, allowing you to interact with the environment and attack enemies with different types of ammo. One problem with this is that controls get switched around once your weapons are equipped. That’s not to say you can’t use both!</p><p><strong>If you hold down L1 while holding a weapon, you can push in the left stick to shoot your slinger.</strong> The one drawback is that heavy ammo, such as Heavy Slicing Pods, can’t be used with most weapons equipped. Only the Sword and Shield can freely use any Slinger ammo type.</p><h2 id="h26188"><a id="4"></a>There is a separate Slinger item bar</h2><figure id="" data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up, you guessed it, is another shortcut for your Slinger. This one also goes hand-in-hand with the previous shortcut. Since all the craftable Slinger ammo takes spots in your inventory, you might think that you can only equip them from that menu. Fortunately, there is a more practical option.</p><p><strong>While holding down L1/LB, you can press L2/LT to bring up an item bar list limited to Slinger-related items from your inventory.</strong> I’ve found this to be a huge time-saver in contrast to swiping through everything I’m carrying. I do want to emphasize that it will only include items from your inventory. Any you pick up from the environment or off of monsters will not be included in this tiny item bar.</p><h2 id="h26189"><a id="5"></a>You can gather some resources without looking at them</h2><figure id="" data-id="86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-recommend-id="image://86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-recommend-id="image://86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each area in the game is home to numerous materials. Gathering these are vital for crafting new items, forging new gear, and even finding rare items to trade for. None of that changes how tedious or occasionally inconvenient the process can be. Thankfully, there is a feature mentioned early on that could be a big help.</p><p>Holding down L2/LT will bring up a list on the left side of the screen of interactable items within your slinger’s range. You’ll then be able to do the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pressing up or down on the d-pad will cycle through this list</li><li>Pressing left or right on the d-pad will cycle through this list and point your camera towards it. I’ve enjoyed using this to find anything that’s difficult to see in the terrain</li><li>Pressing Circle/B will let you immediately gather the highlighted item with your slinger, if possible</li></ul><h2 id="h26190"><a id=""></a>Your secondary mantle has a quick-select</h2><figure id="" data-id="3b01861fece5b8330d158a7b6aebf745" data-recommend-id="image://3b01861fece5b8330d158a7b6aebf745" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Inside the training area, a Hunter throws on a mantle while holding a Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Inside the training area, a Hunter throws on a mantle while holding a Hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b01861fece5b8330d158a7b6aebf745" data-recommend-id="image://3b01861fece5b8330d158a7b6aebf745" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Inside the training area, a Hunter throws on a mantle while holding a Hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has more controls than your controller has buttons</strong>.

Thankfully, there is a quick-select option.</p><p><strong>The trick to quickly select your secondary Mantle is to hold L1/LB and then press R2/RT.</strong> Your hunter will immediately equip it, even when a weapon is equipped. Using this shortcut again will have them remove the mantle.

Why only for Canada and not the rest of North America remains to be seen. Nintendo went out of its way to stress that the Switch 2, currently $450, will not see its price go up. However, amiibo and Switch Online memberships will be included in the pricing changes. New amiibo in the U.S. already jumped to a whopping $30 each. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lfm4uu/30_price_for_amiibos_is_not_doing_well_for/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lfm4uu/30_price_for_amiibos_is_not_doing_well_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans haven’t been impressed</a></span>. </p><p>The seemingly likely price hikes come as other console makers raise prices across the board.

Standard games like <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> have bumped up to $70, while some like <em>Mario Kart World</em> are $80. Players balked at the steep increases, in addition to the Switch 2 being priced at $450 with most of its accessories sold separately, but that hasn’t slowed the new system’s momentum yet. It’s already the fastest-selling console ever with 3 million units shipped in the first week. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-price-cut-canada-ps-plus-game-pass-1851785360]]></content:encoded>

Amazon reportedly tried to offer better labeling to make it clear which products were coming officially from Nintendo and which ones weren’t, but that apparently wasn’t enough to mend the relationship. </p><p> “There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers,” a spokesperson for Nintendo told Bloomberg. Amazon also played dumb, calling the reporting “inaccurate” and stating that it was “pleased to offer Nintendo products directly to our customers as part of our commitment to providing an exceptional shopping experience with the widest selection possible.” </p><p>Those products it does offer include the original Switch and first-party games for it, as well as third-party releases for the Switch 2 like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The Switch 2 and its Nintendo games, however, remain absent. Search for <em>Mario Kart World </em>and you will instead get listings for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Two notable exceptions: you can currently pre-order both <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. </p><p>Has the beef been squashed, or are these pre-orders for upcoming games just a test run to see if Amazon can <em>allegedly</em> get back into Nintendo’s good graces? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></span>, also launching this year, does not have a pre-order listing.

Wonder</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> are all $15 off at the moment. Even<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em> is just $48. Buy it and pay $10 for the  upgrade and you’re effectively saving $22 off the sticker price of a Switch 2 launch game. I’m sure Nintendo’s not pissed about that at all.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-amazon-pokemon-za-donkey-kong-preorder-1851785352]]></content:encoded>

However,<strong> ES Fulghor seemingly starts in the original’s second phase and will use its most dangerous move: the one where it charges up an aura to summon blades of lightning from the ground</strong>.

Fulghor hits hard and is very aggressive, so you’ll need players who can dish out damage just as well as they take.</p><h2 id="h101387"><a id="2"></a>Fighting Everdark Soveriegn Fulghor</h2><p>ES Fulghor retains most of its normal attacks, which involve swiping its giant weapon on the ground and creating shockwaves. The swipe itself is easy to dodge, but there’s a delay between the shockwave’s emergence, which can be a bit difficult to avoid. When Fulghor swipes at you, it’s best to dodge <em>towards</em> it, so you don’t get caught in the shockwave after.</p><p>Visually, one of the biggest changes to Fulghor is that it now has its other arm back! It’ll still grow out that grotesque purple arm, though, just like the normal version. When Fulghor reveals the giant purple arm, it’ll slam the ground, unleashing a purple shockwave AOE. This attack comes out incredibly fast, and you’re very unlikely to outrun the blast radius, so your best option is to time your dodge to avoid it.</p><figure id="" data-id="3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-recommend-id="image://3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1101" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-recommend-id="image://3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1101" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>ES Fulghor carries over its rush attack from its normal version. Here, Fulghor will charge at you a few times, leaving a trail of explosive light behind. It takes a few seconds for the light trail to blow up, so it’s to just move out of the way.</p><p>One of ES Fulghor’s new tricks sees it floating up in the sky, and then creating “clouds” that shoot arrows of light towards the ground. The clouds can track your position, so be aware, but they will dissipate shortly. </p><figure id="" data-id="d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-recommend-id="image://d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-recommend-id="image://d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fulghor can now also turn its weapon into a giant twinblade of light. It’ll then perform a 360 degree sweep around itself twice before jumping up and slamming the blade down into the ground, creating a small shockwave. The best way to avoid these attacks is to just dodge-roll through them.</p><p>Last and certainly not least, ES Fulghor’s new most dangerous attack is when it gallops into the air and charges up a giant arrow of light. This attack has an absolutely huge AOE radius and is hard to run away from. Your best option here is to have the entire team disperse in different directions so that when Fulghor targets one of you, the other two are far away enough to avoid the explosion that comes after the arrow.</p><figure id="" data-id="3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-recommend-id="image://3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-recommend-id="image://3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After defeating Fulghor, you’ll earn 25 Sovereign Sigils, which can be spent at the new Collector Signboard outside of the castle hub area.

It costs 12 Sovereign Sigils to purchase and comes with the following effects:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Increased Maximum Stamina</li><li>Boosts Attack Power of Added Affinity Attacks</li><li>Defeating enemies fills more of the Art gauge</li></ul><p>Everdark Sovereigns cycle in and out every week.
