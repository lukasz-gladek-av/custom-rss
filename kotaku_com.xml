              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">PlayStation’s decision to shut down Bluepoint Games</a> went over very poorly with fans. Unfortunately, the bad vibes are coming right as Bungie is getting ready to launch<em> Marathon</em>. Frustrated comments are now clogging up the PlayStation social feeds as some PS5 players threaten to boycott the extraction shooter and any future live-service games from Sony.</p> <p>On February 19, Sony confirmed it was shutting down Bluepoint Games, a studio that has become well respected for its high-quality remakes and remasters of older games. The studio was caught up in<a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"> Sony’s live-service shuffle</a> after the <em>God of War</em> online spin-off it was reportedly working on was shelved, and none of its other pitches were approved. The news upset a lot of people, including developers and fans. And now, <em>Marathon</em>, a live-service shooter from Bungie and Sony, is set to release in two weeks and has become a target for frustrated players tired of Sony’s online game push.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two weeks to go.</p> <p>Marathon, Bungie's futuristic PvPvE extraction FPS,&nbsp;launches March 5. Try the Server Slam at no cost February 26 to March 2: <a href="https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8">https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8</a> <a href="https://t.co/slN6eLb3jS">pic.twitter.com/slN6eLb3jS</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On Thursday, t<a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466">he official PlayStation account on Twitter posted</a> a boring marketing tweet hyping up players by reminding them that <em>Marathon</em> was just two weeks away and a free beta was launching even sooner. But if you check the replies, people aren’t hyped. They are the opposite of hyped. Mad players still reeling from the Bluepoint news are claiming that they will boycott <em>Marathon</em> entirely, while others are simply hoping it will flop or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">calling it the next <em>Concord</em>.</a></p> <blockquote><p>“Refunded! Im not going to support any GaaS from PlayStation after closing down BluePoint Games,” said one user with a screenshot claiming to show the return.</p> <p>“This game will be a major flop for you guys! Watch us not buy this trash and destroy it with reviews. I will never forget what you did to Bluepoint,” posted another fan.</p> <p>“I’m thinking not to support this game, after today’s disappointing announcement,” said someone else on Twitter.</p> <p>“I’m definitely not playing this out of spite. Bluepoint doesn’t deserve to get shut down. If it weren’t for <em>Demon’s Souls,</em> I wouldn’t have bought a PS5 at launch,” claimed one player.</p> <p>“I hope everyone boycotts <em>Marathon</em> for you closing Bluepoint,” shared a different user.</p></blockquote> <p>And it goes on. As of 1:30 p.m. EST on February 20, the tweet has over 1,900 replies, and many of them are from fans angry with Sony and the Bluepoint news. Over on YouTube, the comments aren’t nearly as aggressively anti-<em>Marathon</em>, but you can find plenty of newer replies claiming they will boycott the game or wishing for <em>Marathon</em> to flop. It also seems like PlayStation has stopped posting on social media due to the backlash, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/sony-goes-silent-on-social-media-as-fans-turn-feral-following-bluepoint-closure">as pointed out by <em>Push Square.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

 <p>Will any of this actually hurt <em>Marathon</em>? Probably not. Angry gamers claiming they intend to boycott a popular game and then playing it anyway is a common trend, as seen in this classic image of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a40ji/modern_warfare_2_boycott_fail/">C<em>all of Duty</em> players in a boycott <em>MW2</em> group playing the game on launch day</a>.</p>

 <p>So yeah, I find it hard to believe that most offline gamers who aren’t scanning sites like <em>Kotaku</em> and Reddit daily for news and leaks even know Bluepoint is closing up or could even name the studio if asked. Still, games like <em>Marathon</em> need a dedicated playerbase that will stick around through all the updates, and often those players are the terminally online sickos out there following game accounts on Twitter and keeping up with the news. It seems that for many of these gamers, <em>Marathon</em> is exactly what they don’t want more of, and Bluepoint’s death has only galvanized them against Sony’s live-service push.</p>

            <guid>1442098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Look, I know people are mad about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>Switch ports costing $20</span></a><span>, but I feel like this anger needs a redirect. We should actually be more mad that this sick physical edition of the ports isn’t coming anywhere outside of Japan.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html"><span>Japanese Pokémon Center</span></a><span> is selling a roughly $130 special edition of </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>for Switch that includes replicas of the original Game Boy Advance packaging, as well as a set of glass Poké Balls for each of the original starter Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Look at them! They light up and everything! It’s such a pretty package, and if you’re not in Japan, I’m sorry that I showed you something you can’t have.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen special physical bundle will be available in Japan on the Pokémon Center Online!</p> <p>– Glass Poké Ball set<br>– GBA replica packaging set<br>– One game download card<br>– Specially designed case<br>– Price is 19,800yen ($127)<a href="https://t.co/k6YZZk4Cjn">https://t.co/k6YZZk4Cjn</a> <a href="https://t.co/dzqrO4rOlf">pic.twitter.com/dzqrO4rOlf</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/2024771449656131802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Granted, like most exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>merchandise in this package, this will no doubt end up on resale sites for a grossly overinflated price thanks to scalpers. So it’s not impossible for you to get one if you don’t live in Japan, it’s just probably going to be much more expensive. Go with Arceus, friends.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> Switch ports are launching digitally next week on February 27 after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>the Pokémon Day Presents showcase</span></a><span> as part of the series’ 30th anniversary celebration. The games are remakes of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>games that started it all back in 1996, and were originally released in 2004.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Folks are feeling pretty sore about the $20 price tag on these twenty-year-old games, but </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3mfbjadx6sk2w"><span>some speculate</span></a><span> that the games skipped the Nintendo Switch Online subscription in favor of a downloadable version because the service’s rewind features would make it easier to save scum a series that has, historically, gone out of its way to ensure that is harder to do. Either way, it’s cheaper than buying them secondhand for your GBA, I suppose.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a> <span>is just a week away from its February 27 launch, but it has also leaked ahead of time thanks to some retailers and fans getting early physical copies. As such, Capcom has released a statement asking fans not to spread any of the spoilers and footage circulating online.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement posted <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590?s=20">on the series’ social channels</a>, Capcom says it is issuing takedowns on early leaked footage, and wants fans to be respectful of those who are looking for a spoiler-free experience next week by not sharing any videos or details on social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Please don’t post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We really want everyone to enjoy the game’s story and experience as much as possible. Our legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience.</span></p> <p><span>It’s not long now until the game is out, so we look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!</span></p></blockquote> <p><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> has suffered a handful of leaks since it was announced last year, including the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/leon-kennedy-resident-evil-requiem-9-playable-leak-2000651669"><span>accidental reveal of Leon Kennedy as a returning playable character</span></a><span> days before it was officially announced. Nothing compares to footage of the game’s finale circulating around the internet, though. Stay safe out there and mute any key terms on social media to minimize the risk of finding out how Grace and Leon’s story ends. Or, better yet, just stop looking at social media altogether. You’ll save yourself from spoilers and also avoid seeing all the brainrotting nonsense the internet beams directly into your eyeballs.</span></p>
