              <p>The (nearly) complete <a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em></a> experience, including all 25 levels and bald assassin Agent 47 himself, is making the leap from consoles and PC to iPhone and iPad. But folks might be shocked by the high sticker price of this new, portable version of the stealth action game.</p> <p>On August 27, as previously teased, IO Interactive released <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hitman-world-of-assassination/id6742786366?platform=ipad"><em>Hitman: WOA</em> on the Apple App Store</a>. It supports newer iPhones and iPads and includes almost the full experience, though it isn’t shipping with the wonderful roguelike mode, Freelancer. Instead, that will be added in a later, free update. Still, having all of <em>Hitman, Hitman 2, </em>and <em>Hitman 3 </em>in your pocket is wild. It also isn’t cheap. This version of the game can be downloaded freely, and you can play the first level at no cost, but to play the rest of the game, you’ll need to fork over $70. Or you can spend $3 per level, which equals around $72 before tax. Yikes.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="HITMAN World of Assassination - iOS Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYJwROKrP6I?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to a press release for the new port, IOI has “designed an entirely touch control scheme built specifically for iPhone and iPad.” Which is neat, but don’t worry, the game supports controllers, too. Still, I can’t help but look at that $70 price tag for a mobile game, one which is a many-years-old console/PC port, and make a weird noise. This same package, with Freelancer, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOopEwi6qPusLtSLqi-aw1HtKt3Iqx9rbzeD9cicht8xalRqrsLvV#dlc">is available on Switch 2 for just $60.</a> It seems odd to charge such a premium for a mobile port, especially when there’s plenty of data to show that these fancy iPhone AAA ports <a href="https://kotaku.com/re7-aaa-ios-iphone-village-remake-flop-low-sales-why-1851595596">don’t sell well at all on the platform.</a></p> <p>But I need to be careful and stop being too critical of this pricey new <em>Hitman</em> phone port because I just noticed my neighbor trimming the bushes outside looks a lot more bald and brooding than usual, and is that a rubber duck in his hand…oh no.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is one of 2025’s biggest surprise success stories. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG has gone on to sell more than </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><span>3.3 million copies</span></a><span> since its launch in April, and is a frontrunner as we head into Game of the Year talks in December. Naturally, Sandfall Interactive is looking to capitalize on all this by making </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>a full-blown franchise rather than a one-off, as director Guillaume Broche has hinted that it has more stories to tell.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4"><span>MrMattyPlays</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>), Broche says that </span><i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>is “not the end” of the series, and that Sandfall Interactive hopes to release more games under the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>umbrella. Whether that means direct sequels to </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> or if Sandfall Interactive decides to go </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>the </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>route</span></a><span> and create an anthology of separate stories remains to be seen.</span></p> <p><span>“</span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> is the franchise name,” Broche says. “</span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> franchise.”</span></p> <p><span>If a sequel is set in the same universe as </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, it’s unlikely that it would take place after the original game. Its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>branching endings</span></a><span> leave that world in two markedly different states, and neither of them screams “sequel bait.” Sandfall Interactive might explore any of the other numbered expeditions in a prequel, but we do know how all of those turned out based on the logs they left behind. There’s also the “outside world” storyline that is briefly touched on in Act 3 but never resolved. I’ll stay vague on that one to avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a lot of possibilities for the future of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>.</span></p>
