              <p>Buying official chargers from tech companies feels like highway robbery when you see Apple charging $59 for a basic 35W single-port USB-C adapter which makes you wonder if they think everyone has unlimited money to burn on accessories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baseus 2-pack 65W charger bundle</strong> flips that equation completely by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">giving you two three-port chargers for $28 total, dropping from the usual $49 price tag</a> to hit an all-time low for Black Friday on Amazon. Each charger pushes 65W when you plug in a single device which means you can actually fast-charge a MacBook Air at full speed instead of watching the battery percentage crawl upward like a lazy snail. You get <strong>six charging ports total across both units</strong>, and that’s the kind of flexibility that solves the eternal problem of fighting over outlets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W, Two Chargers</h2>
<p>The intelligent charging technology inside these blocks automatically figures out how much power each connected device needs and <strong>splits the 65W accordingly</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not manually calculating wattage or worrying about frying your phone because you plugged it into the wrong port. You can charge your laptop, phone, and earbuds simultaneously from a single charger without everything slowing down to a frustrating trickle, though connecting<strong> three devices does divide that 65W among them</strong> based on what each one can handle. It also operates on a <strong>92% energy conversion rate thanks to the GaN chip technology</strong>&nbsp;which means less wasted electricity and noticeably cooler operation compared to older, silicon-based chargers that get hot enough to cook an egg.</p>



<p>The compact size is <strong>41% smaller than Apple’s original 65W brick</strong> and matters more than you think once you’re trying to fit chargers into already-stuffed laptop bags or tight outlet spaces behind furniture. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body so they won’t snag on clothes or scratch other gear rattling around in your backpack.</p>
<p>You can fast-charge an<strong> iPhone 17 from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> or power up a Dell laptop without the need for its original, bulky charger. The <strong>USB-A port handles older devices</strong> that haven’t made the USB-C jump yet and saves you from having to carry separate adapters for wireless headphones, older tablets, or that one weird gadget that just refuses to adopt modern standards.</p>



<p>The <strong>lower operating temperature</strong> keeps these chargers safe to touch even after hours of continuous use, unlike some cheap alternatives that get concerningly hot and make you nervous about leaving them plugged in overnight. Each port delivers consistent power without the voltage fluctuations that can damage batteries over time, protecting your expensive devices while they charge.</p>
<p>At $28 for two 65W three-port chargers, you’re spending less than half what Apple charges for their wimpy 35W single-port adapter, and you’re getting roughly six times the functionality in return. This Black Friday price works out to $14 per charger which is basically impulse-purchase territory for accessories that’ll get daily use for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Goes Zero-Profit on WH-1000XM5, 2x Cheaper Than AirPods Max and Bose]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-wh-1000xm5-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-and-bose-2000647400</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-wh-1000xm5-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-and-bose.1364857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony just launched the <em>1000XM6</em> headphones, pushing the XM5 model into second place in the lineup but <strong>the performance gap feels like a minimum</strong> while the price difference stretches over… $200! The new XM6 demands $449 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/">while Amazon just dropped the WH-1000XM5 to $248 from its usual $399</a> (38% off), hitting a record low that makes this generation the obvious choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This deal also positions the <strong>XM5 at roughly half the price of Apple’s AirPods Max</strong> which costs about $550 and delivers similar specs without justifying that massive premium. The feature sets across all these flagship models is nearly identical with slight tweaks that don’t justify paying double and makes<strong> this almost 40% Black Friday discount surprisingly aggressive</strong> for headphones that rank among the best available.</p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Blocks the World</h2>
<p><strong>Adaptive noise cancelation technology</strong> automatically adjusts to your environment and head position with multiple microphones that sample ambient sound and produce opposing frequencies that cancel unwanted noise. You get great silence on planes, trains, and busy offices where background chatter normally destroys concentration and forces you to crank the volume to dangerous levels.</p>
<p>The Auto NC optimizer analyzes a<strong>tmospheric pressure and adjusts cancellation accordingly</strong>&nbsp;which matters more than you might think when you’re flying at altitude, where changes in air density alter how sound travels. This system works so well that you’ll sometimes take the headphones off to check whether the announcements are playing or whether the cancellation merely served to block them out completely.</p>



<p>With noise canceling activated,<strong> battery life extends to 30 hours</strong> and covers weeks of daily commutes before needing a charge. Quick charging saves you when you forget to charge overnight and rush out the door: three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in. The lightweight design distributes pressure evenly across your head, preventing the fatigue and headaches that plague cheaper headphones after an hour of wear. <strong>Soft ear cushions seal around your ears</strong> without creating that uncomfortable vacuum feeling, maintaining comfort during marathon listening sessions where lesser headphones become unbearable.</p>
<p>Sound quality delivers Sony’s<strong> signature balanced profile, with detailed mids, clear highs, and controlled bass</strong> that doesn’t overwhelm everything else into muddy soup. The 40mm drivers produce accurate audio reproduction across all frequencies, letting you hear instrument separation in complex mixes and subtle details in well-produced tracks.</p>



<p>Alexa voice control responds to commands without touching your phone, though Google Assistant and Siri also work if you prefer different ecosystems. The speak-to-chat feature automatically pauses music when you start talking, then resumes after you finish your conversation and removes the annoyance of manually controlling playback during brief interactions.</p>
<p>Multipoint connectivity lets you <strong>pair with two devices at once</strong> and fluidly switch from your laptop for work calls to your phone for music without needing to constantly disconnect and reconnect. Touch controls reside on the ear cups and manage volume, track skipping, and call management via swipes and taps, though the learning curve takes a few days before gestures become second nature. <strong>A carrying case with the headphones protects them during travel</strong> and folds flat to save bag space, while the headphones themselves fold into a compact shape rather than just having the ear cups swivel flat.</p>
<p>At $248 instead of $399, you’re saving $151 on headphones that match or outperform the competition at significantly higher price points including Apple’s AirPods Max at double this Black Friday price. That value gets even clearer when you put this deal up against the new XM6 at $449; for $201 extra, you’re getting marginal improvements that most won’t notice in real-world use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple refuses to discount products on its own website even for items that have been around for years like the AirTag which means you need to shop smarter and hit up retailers with actual pricing flexibility like Amazon. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Bluetooth trackers just dropped to $64 for a four-pack from the usual $99,</a> which marks an all-time low with the kind of discount you rarely see on Apple products.</p>
<p>AirTags solve the daily frustration of searching for misplaced items by letting you ping their location through your iPhone’s <em>Find My</em> network and turns frantic morning searches into quick 30-second retrievals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Finding That Actually Works in Real Life</h2>
<p>The <em>Find My</em> network uses <strong>hundreds of millions of Apple devices to detect the location of your AirTag</strong> anonymously and relay that information, creating a crowdsourced tracking system that works even when your tagged item ends up miles away from you. You get precision finding with iPhone models that feature the U1 chip, which uses ultra-wideband technology to guide you directly to your lost item with on-screen arrows and distance measurements.</p>



<p><strong>Setup takes literally one tap</strong> when you hold an AirTag near your iPhone or iPad, with the device automatically recognizing it and walking you through naming and assigning it to an item. The <strong>CR2032 battery lasts over a year</strong> before needing replacement, and swapping it out requires just a quick twist of the AirTag’s back cover rather than sending the whole unit back to Apple or dealing with proprietary charging cables.</p>
<p>There’s also a <strong>built-in speaker for playing sounds</strong> to help find items when they’re nearby but buried in couch cushions or hiding in your coat pocket. Its volume could be louder to find tags in noisy environments.<strong> Water and dust resistance</strong>, thanks to its IP67 rating, means your AirTag survives being caught in rain, dropped in puddles, or living inside your gym bag with sweaty clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy protections</strong> prevent creepy tracking scenarios by alerting you if an unknown AirTag follows you around, addressing concerns of people using these devices to stalk others without consent. The system regularly rotates Bluetooth identifiers so that random people can’t track your movements by detecting the same AirTag signal repeatedly over time. If you find a lost AirTag, you can tap it with any NFC-capable phone to see the owner’s contact information if they’ve marked it as lost, making returns possible even for non-iPhone users.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-pack setup gives you enough AirTags</strong> to cover your most frequently misplaced items, such as keys, wallet, backpack, and luggage, without needing to constantly move a single tracker between items. You can label each AirTag with custom names and emojis in the Find My app, making it easy to tell “work backpack” from “gym bag” at a glance. The system works seamlessly across your Apple devices, so you can trigger an AirTag sound from your iPad when your iPhone is the thing you actually lost.</p>
<p>At $64 for four AirTags, instead of the usual $99, you pay $16 per tracker instead of nearly $25 and that finally brings the cost per unit down to something reasonable rather than feeling like the Apple tax in full effect. This Black Friday discount makes equipping your entire life with tracking capabilities actually affordable, especially compared to buying AirTags individually at a price of $29 each when you need more than one or two.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-lost-its-mind-on-mic-mini-premium-wireless-transmitter-crashes-to-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000647310</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-lost-its-mind-on-mic-mini-premium-wireless-transmitter-crashes-to-all-time-low-on-amazon.1364824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It wasn’t long before <strong>wireless microphones</strong> became essential equipment for content creators tired of dealing with tangled cables and audio that sounds like you’re recording in a bathroom. The <strong>DJI Mic Mini</strong> earned its spot as the go-to choice among top creators for good reason, and the bundle with two transmitters is now entirely out of stock on Amazon, which says it all about how hot this system is.</p>
<p>But the good news, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5939/">another DJI bundle with a single transmitter has fallen to $45 from its usual $89 price tag (49% off)</a>, hitting an all-time low that makes professional audio accessible without the usual sticker shock. This deal probably won’t last that long considering just how fast the dual pack disappeared and getting one now beats waiting for empty stock pages later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5939/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Audio Quality That Separates Amateur From Pro</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic Mini captures <strong>detail-rich audio with noise-canceling technology</strong> that removes background hum, wind noise, and the general chaos of recording in real-world environments instead of soundproof studios. You get <strong>automatic limiting that prevents distortion</strong> when your voice gets loud or excited, saving you from that clipping audio that ruins otherwise perfect takes.</p>
<p>The ultralight design weighs so little you forget you’re wearing it after the first few minutes, and that matters during long recording sessions when heavier mics start to feel like ankle weights around your collar. The <strong>400-meter transmission range</strong> gives you freedom to move without staying tethered to your camera or phone, whether filming a house tour, doing street interviews, or just walking and talking through your latest vlog idea.</p>



<p>It works <strong>seamlessly with an iPhone, Android, or camera</strong> via plug-and-play connectivity that doesn’t take an engineering degree to set up. You clip the transmitter onto your shirt, plug the receiver into your device, and in mere seconds, you are recording clean audio instead of wrestling for twenty minutes trying to get a connection.</p>
<p>This compact receiver easily slides onto your camera’s hot shoe or directly connects to your phone, not adding bulk that makes your entire setup feel awkward and unbalanced. The <strong>battery life will easily last long enough for several shoots</strong> before needing to be recharged: you won’t have to constantly interrupt your creative flow, looking for a place to swap batteries or find power outlets.</p>



<p>Recording quality jumps noticeably compared to the built-in microphones on phones and cameras, and gives your videos that polished sound which actually makes viewers want to stick around rather than click away after ten seconds. The<strong> system automatically syncs audio to your video feed</strong>, and saves you the frustration of manually matching sound files in editing software later. <strong>Wind noise reduction works</strong> impressively well for outdoor recording, though extremely windy days still benefit from the included windscreen that blocks gusts without muffling your voice.</p>
<p>At $45 for this one-transmitter setup, you’re paying half the normal price for audio gear that immediately elevates your content above the tinny, echo-filled sound that screams <em>“amateur hour”</em> to anyone watching. Professional wireless systems from traditional audio brands cost three or four times this price, and they don’t necessarily sound better or work more reliably than the Mic Mini delivers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-22tb-hard-drive-cut-55-off-giant-storage-cheaper-than-tiny-4tb-budget-drives-2000647391</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-22tb-hard-drive-cut-55-off-giant-storage-cheaper-than-tiny-4tb-budget-drives.1364821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>SSDs are fast but their high cost-per-gigabyte makes them impractical for storing large quantities of data. For simple bulk storage where capacity is more important than ultra-fast transfer speeds, traditional HDDs still rule and Seagate just hit record low pricing across its lineup during Black Friday Week.</p>
<p>However <strong>most capacities sold out rapidly,</strong> with only the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/">massive 22TB model still in stock at $229 instead of the usual $249, and way down from its $599 launch price</a> that made early adopters wince. That works out to about <strong>one cent per gigabyte</strong> and it’s the best value cost-per-GB storage you can find right now on Amazon during Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Handles Your Entire Digital Life</h2>
<p>The 22TB capacity gives you breathing room that smaller drives simply can’t match, letting you dump entire external drive collections onto a single unit instead of managing multiple devices with confusing labels. You can <strong>store roughly 4,400 hours of HD video, 5.5 million photos, or 440,000 music files</strong>&nbsp;which covers most people’s entire digital collection with space left over for years of future growth.</p>
<p>USB 3.0 connectivity delivers <strong>transfer speeds around 120-160MB/s depending on file types</strong>&nbsp;which means copying a 100GB folder takes about 10-15 minutes instead of the sub-minute transfers you’d get with an SSD. That speed difference matters less for archival storage where you’re moving files once and accessing them occasionally rather than working directly from the drive daily.</p>



<p><strong>Plug-and-play design works</strong> straight out of the box with Windows and Mac computers, with no software installation or superfluous setup processes to waste your time. You just connect the USB cable, wait for your computer to recognize the drive, and start dragging files over like you would with any storage device. Included <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> provide a safety net if the drive fails and offers professional data recovery attempts that normally cost hundreds or thousands of dollars separately.</p>
<p>The<strong> drive runs quietly during operation without the loud clicking</strong> and whirring that older external drives produced, though you’ll still hear some mechanical noise since spinning platters can’t match the silent operation of solid-state drives. Seagate’s build quality has improved over the years, with these expansion drives showing solid reliability ratings from users who’ve run them continuously for backup operations. The vertical orientation saves desk space compared to laying drives flat, and the simple black design blends into any workspace without drawing attention.</p>
<p>At $229 for 22TB of storage, you’re paying roughly a penny per gigabyte which is absolutely the floor for cost-effective bulk storage right now in this Black Friday window. The $20 discount from the recent $249 price adds up when you’re buying this much capacity, and compared to the insane $599 launch price, this deal feels like robbery in your favor.</p>

              <p>Black Friday typically means massive LEGO discounts on Amazon with fans waiting to finally pick up those sets they have been eyeing all year at reasonable prices. This year feels a bit like a disappointment as the number of discounted sets fell significantly compared to previous years.</p>
<p>One of the most iconic Star Wars sets managed to make it through with a proper deal, though: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/">the R2-D2 building set dropped to $79 from its usual $99 price tag,</a> and reaches <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this the perfect time to grab it. Star Wars is LEGO’s most popular licensed theme and R2-D2 stands as one of the franchise’s most beloved characters, so getting this particular set on sale feels like winning the Black Friday lottery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Building Experience That Balances Display and Play</h2>
<p>The<strong> 1,050-piece construction gives you a satisfying build session</strong> that takes several hours without becoming frustratingly complex, hitting that sweet spot where you’re engaged but not pulling your hair out over confusing instructions. You assemble R2-D2’s iconic dome head with 360-degree rotation capability, letting you position him looking in any direction once he’s on display. The <strong>detachable third leg recreates the droid’s mobility configuration</strong> from the films, adding an authentic detail that fans immediately recognize and appreciate. <strong>Attachable tools and a periscope</strong> give you multiple display options, so you can swap accessories based on your mood or recreate specific scenes from the movies.</p>



<p>The finished model<strong> stands over 9 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep</strong>, and makes it substantial enough to command attention on a shelf without dominating an entire room like some of Lego’s massive Ultimate Collector Series sets. Once completed, build quality feels solid, with sturdy connections that let you pick up and reposition the model without pieces falling off every time you touch it. Color accuracy is perfect and matches R2-D2’s blue and white scheme with just the right shades that make the droid instantly recognizable even from across a room.</p>
<p>The included <strong>25th-anniversary Darth Malak minifigure </strong>adds collectible value beyond just the main R2-D2 build by giving you a character from the expanded Star Wars universe that doesn’t appear in many sets. The information plaque and display stand, decorated with the LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary logo, turn this from just a toy into a proper display piece that looks intentional on your desk or bookshelf.</p>



<p>It works equally well for <strong>kids aged 10 and upwards</strong> who want to play out Star Wars scenarios and adult collectors who just want a detailed replica sitting next to their other memorabilia. The articulation points and removable accessories encourage actual play rather than static display, but the model is sturdy enough to survive either use case without falling apart.</p>
<p>At $79 instead of the usual $99, you’re saving $20 on one of the few discounted Star Wars LEGO sets available this Black Friday which makes this deal worth jumping on before stock runs out or the price creeps back up.</p>

              <p>Backing up files or moving large projects between devices should not feel like paint drying but traditional hard drives (HDD) make you wait what felt like forever as they spin and click their way through transfers. External SSDs changed the game when they reduced those wait times to mere seconds instead of minutes and the <strong>SanDisk 2TB SSD takes the speed advantage</strong> and wraps it in a package that is tough enough to survive your daily chaos.</p>
<p>This drive hits <strong>read speeds up to 1050MB/s and write speeds around 1000MB/s</strong> which means transferring a 4K movie takes about 30 seconds instead of several minutes. Its 2TB capacity gives you plenty of room for your entire photo library and a solid collection of games. And the good news, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">Amazon dropped the price to $179 from the usual $209 for Black Friday</a> (and it was launched at $250) which marks an all-time low.</p>

<h2>Speed That Matches Your Workflow</h2>
<p>The <strong>NVMe solid-state performance</strong> inside this compact drive delivers the kind of transfer rates that make backing up your laptop or editing 4K footage directly from the drive practical. You can drag and drop a 50GB project folder and watch it complete before you finish your coffee which beats the old-school external hard drive experience where you’d start a transfer and go make lunch.</p>
<p>The <strong>USB-C connection works with both USB 3.2 Gen 2 and backward-compatible ports</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not locked into only the newest devices. This level of performance allows video editors to work with high-resolution footage without needing to pre-copy everything to their internal drive first and allows photographers to cull through thousands of RAW files without the lag that makes you want to throw your mouse across the room.</p>



<p>The <strong>IP65 rating protects against water splashes</strong> and dust intrusion which matters more than you think when you’re tossing this drive in bags, leaving it on outdoor shoot locations, or just living your normal clumsy life. SanDisk upgraded the drop protection to 3 meters, so those accidental falls from your desk or even that low tree branch on a hiking shoot aren’t going to turn your entire project archive into a paperweight.</p>
<p>The rubberized exterior provides grip and <strong>another layer of shock absorption</strong> while the included carabiner loop lets you clip it to your backpack or belt loop if you’re the type that needs gear within arm’s reach at all times. Tha<strong>t 256-bit AES hardware encryption</strong> with password protection keeps your files secure in case the drive goes missing, giving you one less thing to panic about if you leave it in a coffee shop.</p>



<p>The SanDisk Memory Zone app will help you figure out what’s taking up space and automatically back up your phone content so you don’t have to remember to do this every few months. Because of solid-state technology (not generating the heat from spinning platters), the drive keeps cool during long transfer sessions, and a compact form factor means it disappears into any bag pocket.</p>
<p>For $179, 2TB of fast, rugged storage <strong>costs less than 9 cents per gigabyte</strong>, and that’s exactly the kind of value that makes upgrading your entire backup strategy a no-brainer instead of a budget debate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> has been out for about two months now, and in that time, I’ve played around 90 hours or so of EA’s big new online military shooter. I really, really like it! But, as with any <em>Battlefield</em> game, not every map is great. In fact, some are downright awful.</p> <p>So, after playing every map more times than I count and following EA’s addition of two new maps in the game’s first season, I’ve sat down and ranked them all from worst to best. We’ll update this list as EA adds new maps over the next few months.&nbsp; Oh, and I mostly play Conquest and Escalation, so keep that in mind as you scroll through the list.</p>

 <h2>12 – New Sobek City</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647402">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I don’t play this map anymore because I enjoy my life and don’t enjoy fighting 20+ snipers on rooftops and helicopters that hide at their base to avoid being destroyed. But when I did play it, I hated nearly every moment! I’d rather eat glass.</p>

 <h2>11 – Blackwell Fields</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647403">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve played so many matches on Blackwell Fields since it was added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points-2000646929"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> as part of season one.&nbsp; Half the time, it’s a boring blowout, and the other half it’s a miserable slog through an empty hellscape as you pray for your tickets to run out and the match to end. Snipers are everywhere, doing nothing to help either team win. Everybody else picks engineer as an overreaction to all the vehicles. Bleh. Bad. Ugly, too! Hate it.</p>

 <h2>10 – Empire State</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647404"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647404">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Empire State only sneaks past Blackwell Fields because it has no vehicles. That makes it especially interesting as a Conquest map. It’s not good, mind you, as having no tanks or APCs means every push into occupied territory is done on foot. This is also a map where it never feels like a frontline is established. Instead, I just get domed from every direction and curse myself for not removing this bad map from the custom search pool.</p>

 <h2>9 – Saints Quarter</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647405"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647405">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>If you only play BF6’s big modes, like Conquest or Rush, you might not have even seen this map. But it’s there and is the one map exclusive to small modes. It serves its purpose as a meat grinder maze for smaller modes and looks pretty doing it. But that’s about all I have to say about Saints Quarter, a map I usually forget about.</p>

 <h2>8 – Manhattan Bridge</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647406" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647406"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647406">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Unlike Empire State, this other NYC map isn’t a painful experience. In fact, I’ve had some solidly fun matches on here. Its real problem is how small it is. If this map had a few more streets and alleys, it might be higher on the list. At least it ain’t Empire State. So it has that going for it.</p>

 <h2>7 – Iberian Offensive</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647407"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647407">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s a good map in here. I know it. I think if some of its control points got spaced out a bit more, or the main HQs were pushed back a tad, it would help. As is, most matches devolve into teams fighting over E and C. Some of those fights are fun. Some are not. I’m usually not too mad to play this one, but I’m not looking forward to it.</p> <h2>6 – Siege of Cairo</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647408"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647408">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>The first “great” map on this list. Siege of Cairo isn’t massive, but it feels bigger thanks to areas that are clearly designed for big fights and vehicles, and smaller, congested sections focused on infantry warfare. You feel like you are moving in and out of various conflicts as you cross this map. And the main street in the middle often becomes a hard-fought piece of ground where I’ve experienced many memorable moments.</p> <h2>5 – Operation Firestorm</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647409">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>A <em>Battlefield</em> classic returns, and <em>Battlefield 6 i</em>s better off for it. I do have some issues with some of the control points and how big they are, and how easy it is for a single player to hide away to hold them or take them. But I can overlook that because this big map has so much space to work with and features all the vehicles you’d expect, plus plenty of places to escape or even ambush them with rockets. Let’s add Caspian Border next, please.</p>

 <h2>4 – Fort Lyndon</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647410"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647410">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>I <em>nearly</em> didn’t include this map because it’s only (officially) available in Redsec aka <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode. But it’s still a damn fine map and a big one, too. I don’t play much Redsec as I prefer solo battle royales, but when I do hop in, I’m always impressed at how large Fort Lyndon is and all the visual variety. Then I get sad that <em>BF6</em> seemingly supports big maps, but we still don’t have many, and none close to this scale.</p> <h2>3 – Liberation Peak</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647411" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647411"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647411">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Just a damn good map. This mountainous corridor of chaos has just enough open landscape to let vehicles have fun without devolving into a sniper controller wasteland (looking at you, Blackwell Fields), but smartly includes plenty of infantry-focused areas for combat, too. One of those classic Battlefield maps where every piece of the game seems included. And a shoutout to all you soldiers who help my friends and me hold D. A tough job, but important.</p>

 <h2>2 – Mirak Valley</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647412" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647412"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647412">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p>Wonderful stuff here. Mirak Valley is big, but not empty. It sports a few control points in the center that are right next to each other and offer up some hectic and deadly building-to-building skirmishes. But if you prefer more long-range combat, it has control points that offer up plenty of that kind of fighting, too. Vehicles feel powerful on this map, but not overpowered, thanks to just enough indestructible structures that provide infantry with hiding holes. Every time Mirak Valley shows up, I smile a bit and hope the match is a close one that takes a long time.</p> <h2>1 – Eastwood</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647413" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647413"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647413">©EA</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547">This is (as of November 2025) <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s newest map, and it’s also the game’s best</a>. It checks all the boxes that I need checked for a good <em>BF</em> map. Big? Yup. A variety of spaces to fight in and run through? Yes. A cool location with a strong, visually intriguing theme? I mean, it’s a map set near a fancy golf course and rich McMansions. Doesn’t that sound fun to blow up? You can even drive around Eastwood in a golf cart. If future <em>BF6</em> maps are as good as Eastwood, we are going to be in for a real treat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple traditionally avoids discounts and maintains full pricing on its official website and retail stores, treating Black Friday like any other day to preserve its premium brand image. Amazon doesn’t share that restraint and just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">slashed the price of the brand-new Mac mini M4 with 256GB storage to $479 from the usual $599</a>, which <strong>marks a record low</strong> on one of the most powerful compact desktops currently available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This<strong> latest Mac mini tucks the M4 chip into a five-by-five-inch</strong> enclosure that delivers desktop-class performance while taking up less space on your desk than a large coffee mug. The $120 discount is a rare opportunity to grab Apple’s newest silicon at a reduced price instead of waiting months or years for depreciation to make it affordable.</p>

<h2>Desktop Performance in a Tiny Package</h2>
<p>The<strong> M4 chip brings a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU</strong> that handle everything from coding and video editing to casual gaming and AI tasks without breaking a sweat. You get 16GB of unified memory, different from traditional RAM because it allows both the CPU and GPU to draw from the same memory pool, eliminating bottlenecks that slow down graphics-intensive work.</p>
<p>The<strong> 256GB SSD provides fast storage</strong> for your operating system and applications, though you’ll want external drives for large media libraries since that capacity fills up in a hurry with 4K video projects or extensive photo collections. Built for Apple Intelligence, on-device AI processing keeps your data private while delivering features like intelligent writing assistance and advanced photo search without sending information to cloud servers.</p>



<p>The <strong>redesigned chassis puts USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front</strong> for the first time, ending the annoyance of reaching around back to plug in devices or headphones multiple times per day.<strong> Thunderbolt ports</strong> on the rear support up to three displays simultaneously, letting you build a proper multi-monitor workspace that boosts productivity for coding, design work, or financial analysis. <strong>HDMI output connects directly to TVs</strong> or older monitors without requiring adapters and <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> provides stable wired networking for situations where WiFi just doesn’t cut it.</p>
<p><strong>Apps optimized for Apple silicon</strong> run at an incredible speed with the unified memory architecture and efficient chip design that delivers laptop-level power consumption while providing desktop performance levels. Microsoft 365, Adobe Creative Cloud, and thousands of other applications perform seamlessly-whether you’re running complex spreadsheet calculations, editing multi-layer Photoshop files, or compiling code. Native macOS applications feel instantly responsive with zero lag between clicks and actions, creating a computing experience that makes older Intel-based machines feel sluggish by comparison.</p>



<p>With<strong> integration to your iPhone and other Apple devices</strong>, you can create one big ecosystem: copy on one device, paste on another; mirror your iPhone screen to work with mobile apps on a bigger display; or answer FaceTime calls from your Mac while your phone charges across the room. Continuity features eliminate friction from moving between devices: start an email on your phone during a commute and finish it on your Mac when you reach your desk.</p>
<p>At $479 instead of $599, you’re saving $120 on Apple’s latest desktop silicon which brings the entry price for M4 performance down to a level that competes favorably with Windows mini PCs that deliver less power and worse software integration. Compared to other sales, this Black Friday discount makes the Mac mini an actual value proposition rather than just an expensive option for people locked into the Apple ecosystem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Things change a lot in game development. Entire segments get cut, characters who were part of the concept phase never make it into the final product, and sometimes mechanics that were meant to be touchstones of the moment-to-moment disappear after a particularly intense meeting. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> best scene, however, was always part of AdHoc Studio’s superhero workplace comedy.</span></p> <p><span>In Episode five, “Team Building,” protagonist Robert Robertson III goes from chatting with his team of reformed villains over a headset behind an office desk to joining them in a villain bar called the Sardine. Though Robert has (temporarily) retired from his time as a crime-fighting hero, the patrons at the bar don’t take too kindly to his presence, and things get violent. The b</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-best-bar-scene-song-prism-thot-squad-2000645192"><span>ar fight that follows is one of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s most memorable sequences</span></a><span>, both for its violent excess and its cramming some of its best jokes and character showcases into a fleeting five-minute frenzy.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>So how did AdHoc manage to pull this scene off? That’s what I wanted to find out when I sat down with co-directors Dennis Lenart and Chris Rebbert, who told me that, while episode five’s bar fight was always meant to be a tentpole moment in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s story in which Robert won over his team of ex-criminals on their own turf, it actually came together fairly late in the game’s development because the Z-Team itself was still being finalized.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We actually ended up doing a lot of the action scenes last because we were figuring out the powers of everyone along the way,” Lenart said. “As we were working on the dispatch shift mechanic, we were constantly iterating and sometimes swapping powers between heroes if someone was too overpowered. So, a lot of the actiony stuff, especially the bar fight, we wanted to leave until a little bit later, so all the sort of cement had dried for the characters.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000647375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647375"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647375">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Putting a group of super-powered heroes into a small space like a bar is not an easy task, and coming up with individual setpieces and mini-narratives for each of them required a complete and solidified team with definitive powers. Some characters didn’t make it into the game, including one who had ice-based powers that were storyboarded in an early mock-up of the bar fight. But even the characters that were in the final game weren’t entirely set in stone. Malevola, the devilish woman who can open portals, was originally telepathic and able to read people’s “bad” thoughts, which would have changed how she used her talents in a bar fight.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There was like two guys, she’d basically made one goon admit to the other goon that he was in love with his girlfriend or something like that,” Rebbert said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Some of the smaller moments were tweaked over the course of development as Z-Team members solidified, but some of the bar fight’s most effective tricks weren’t in the original script at all. The scene uses a non-linear structure, showing Robert and his crew decompressing at a legally distinct Taco Bell after a fight the player never saw unfold. Then, as Robert tries to make the most of his late-night dinner, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>gives you QTEs that transition from food preparation to the unseen violent bar brawl. The original pitch was much more straightforward.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think it was Dennis’ idea, and we were looking at films like </span><i><span>The Wrestler</span></i><span>, [which] was a big influence,” Rebbert said. “There’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAsn2mw9abE"><span>this locker room scene</span></a><span> where they have a match and it keeps cutting back and forth with them getting staples taken out of their head, and then it cuts in to show how that happened in the actual match. We looked at more samples from that. I found one from </span><i><span>30 Rock</span></i><span>, which is one of my favorite shows. There’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCpw5edmYBw"><span>a scene where Kenneth has a party in that show</span></a><span>, and then nobody talks about it and just cuts to the aftermath where everybody’s looking at each other in the cold light of day, and all the things they did to one another. We just like that energy, right? It was just unexpected, and it kind of opened up what we could do with the QTE system.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>Fourth meal</b></h2> <p><span>Those “unexpected” QTEs include Robert putting a straw in his drink only to hard cut to stabbing a goon in the face with a handful of darts, tearing a cybernetic implant out of someone’s head when you were supposed to be opening a sauce packet, and biting a baddie’s thumb off instead of the end of your taco.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I think the straw might have been the first one,” Lenart said. “I was just like, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if you were doing this mundane thing that turned into some horrific thing?’ Then Chris and I started talking like, ‘Oh, okay, that’s interesting. Well, maybe, in order to do that, you’d have to have this flashback structure.’ I think originally we planned like, five or six flashbacks.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647380"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647380">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The violence is a funny, gross-out gag, but it was also an attempt to make sure </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s QTEs weren’t a “chore.” Compared to the team’s work at Telltale on games like </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wolf Among Us</span></i><span>, where “everything stops in the middle of a chaotic scene” while the game waits for a player’s input, Lenart said he wanted </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s action to flow and be “as entertaining as watching a good action scene in a TV show.” Rebbert added that relying on those slowed-down action sequences would have felt especially odd given the team-based fight scenes in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We’re cognizant of what we always call internally </span><a href="https://fables.fandom.com/wiki/The_Woodsman_(video_game)"><span>‘The Woody Windup,’</span></a><span>” Rebbert said. “It’s a reference to </span><i><span>Wolf Among Us</span></i><span>, where the villain goes like this [imitates a slowed-down winding up for a punch], and it just kills the pacing. I think in this context specifically, it was like, ‘well, what the hell is the Z team doing?’ Well, they’re waiting for you to punch this guy. We’re trying to combat those shortcomings that we found with the mechanic in the past.”</span></p> <p><span>Comparatively, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s action scenes, though a bit more sparse than the average Telltale game, are more fluid, which gives AdHoc more opportunities to pull off fast-paced, comical violence when it fits while also letting the player participate in something precise and choreographed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The sort of arc of the interactivity of the scene is to shock you at first, then go up one level with the second flashback,” Lenart said. “Then the third time, where he lifts the taco to his mouth, the hope was that people would be sitting there going, ‘Oh God, what is he going to do?’”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647381">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Based on the reactions of players and streamers, Rebbert and Lenart reckon those gory back-and-forths accomplished what they set out to do, though they were worried people might hate the entire scene. The three moments that are in the game are only half of the ones the team planned for, which was partially due to budgetary concerns. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s animation pipeline is comparable to an animated film, according to Lenart, which means that scenes like the bar fight got so expensive that AdHoc had to cut frames and seconds of the scene to fit it into its runtime and budget.</span></p> <p><span>Budget restrictions, in this case, worked in the scene’s favor. The structure was partially envisioned to “relieve the burden” of animating the fight from beginning to end, which Lenart says allowed them to look for “just the highlights” of each section. This is why Robert can be doing something terribly violent to a completely different villain at each transition, as it’s implied you’re jumping into a much longer fight when it’s getting good. However, some pretty major gameplay moments ended up getting scrapped in the process, from narrative choices to a live, in-person riff on the game’s dispatch mechanics.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There was a valiant effort to try to do—we called it ‘Live Action Dispatching’ where Robert was sort of like Coach Cartering in the bar fight,” Rebbert said. “Players could choose to send Malevola that way, send Punch Up that way, and it just became too unruly, and it was like one of those things where the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze, production-wise.”</span></p> <p><span>One cut segment had players choosing whether to team up with one member of the Z-Team or the other as the fight got dicey, which would have led to some character-specific moments that didn’t make it into the final game.</span></p> <p><span>“One beat that I’m kind of glad got cut was a point where Robert actually comes out of the bathroom after he’s fighting, and there was a choice that we ended up excising was you saw that Prism was on stage and a shapeshifter had taken the form of one of her holograms, so it was sneaking up on her,” Rebbert said. “Then on the other side of the bar, Punch Up, I can’t remember exactly what was happening with Punch Up, but it was a choice on who to save, right? Who do you go after, and it just ended up being one of those things that felt a little bit more arbitrary, which I think ultimately is why we excised it, but there were fun beats around it where Robert gets in a fight with the Prism hologram if you go on Prism’s side. Then Prism jumps in and saves you, but it’s clear that she just took a guess and accidentally saved you.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647382"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647382">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some characters were cut from the fight, both because of their conditional status as Z-team members and because they narratively didn’t fit the scene’s scrappy vibe. Waterboy and Phenomaman, two heroes the player can choose to add to their team earlier in the season, are omitted from most of it</span></p>

 <p><span>“We ended up deciding that they don’t get involved for various reasons,” Rebbert said. “A, because they’re not villains, and B, because of where they were story-wise in there. Phenomaman is depressed, and Waterboy hasn’t come into his own yet as a hero, so it kind of made sense to put either of them in a cage.”</span></p> <h2><b>Making the most of five minutes</b></h2> <p><span>When you’re working in such a short, five-minute window, AdHoc had to be economic and strategic with the moments it did include, which means that most of one-liners and gags came straight from the script, rather than being improvised. Rebbert jokes that he would be “surprised if [the voice actors] even understood what was happening,” as the chaotic scene was still without visuals during the voice recording sessions. This included Prism’s now iconic “The fuck you mean, ‘temporarily?’ Bitch, you blind foreva” line when she uses her light powers on a goon who exclaims that she “temporarily blinded” him.</span></p>

 <p><span>While her incredible line is not improv, Prism is one of the stars of the fight because her voice is in the background of the entire brawl. The light-manipulating pop star hero is singing “Hoes Depressed” by Thot Squad throughout the fight (Prism is voiced by Thot Squad rapper Blvck Bunnie). Thot Squad’s music is featured multiple times in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, but the cheerleader-like, singsongy “Hoes Depressed” has become synonymous with the bar fight’s rowdy roughhousing. According to Rebbert, Thot Squad’s music was already in consideration for </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>‘s soundtrack before Prism was cast in the role, and once the team realized that a microphone was going to be in the room during the bar fight, one thing led to another, and “Hoes Depressed” became the soundtrack of the scrimmage.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647383"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647383">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“She was just so much fun and full of energy and just so excited to be there, too,” Rebbert said. “Once those things happened, it was like, ‘Well, now we’re definitely going to put a song of hers [in the game]. She’s gonna be on stage singing because we don’t get a chance to do that otherwise in the scene.’ Karaoke was already in the script, and then it was like, ‘Well, there’s a microphone right there. We have a pop star. Why would she be doing anything else right now?’”</span></p>

 <p><span>Prism isn’t the only Z-teamer singing at the Sardine, though. Flambae, the flamboyant, flame-manipulating ex-villain, also has his moment singing an embellished version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivt_N2Zcts">Meredith Brooks’ “Bitch.”</a> At first, Flambae sings an antagonistic rewrite of the 1997 rock anthem that turns the “Bitch” from a self-referential term of endearment into a derogatory one aimed squarely at his boss.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I’m a bitch, my name’s Robert</span></p> <p><span>Such a bitch, whose name is Robert</span></p> <p><span>I’m a bitch, yeah I’m a bitch</span></p> <p><span>I’m such a fucking bitch</span></p> <p><span>I have no hopes, I have no dreams</span></p> <p><span>And a tiny little peen</span></p> <p><span>And it doesn’t even function anyway</span></p> <p><span>Because I have erectile dysfunction</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>At first, Flambae was going to sing a completely different song, but Rebbert and Lenart were hesitant to name it when I asked them what it was. This mystery song would have served the same role, juxtaposing the much heavier flashbacks of an old fight between Flambae and Robert in which the hero severed the fire-bender’s fingers with a cheery-sounding song everyone knows.</span></p>  <p><span>“It’s one of those things where you’re like, ‘Maybe we can get this. This band probably has enough money that they don’t really care about charging a ton for some weird indie game to use this thing,’” Lenart said. “Once the rights were investigated, it was just immediately shut down. There’s no way we could ever afford it.”</span></p> <p><span>Rebbert said that this mystery song was the “first idea” and “more of the obvious choice,” but AdHoc had a “whole spreadsheet” of song ideas and spent months investigating other songs. Whatever they chose had to be a song “enough people [would] be able to recognize from jump.” Rebbert says he takes full credit for using “Bitch,” which he said is a song he sometimes sings to his wife as an inside joke (in first person, thus referring to himself as the titular “Bitch,” he stresses).</span></p>

 <p><span>“Once it was clear that that could be an option, I was like, ‘Guys, I’m not gonna entertain other songs,’ and everybody else had to put up with me,” Rebbert said.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000647384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647384"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647384">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Though they were able to get the rights to “Bitch,” the process of getting it and Flambae’s cover into the game itself was another ordeal. Rebbert rewrote the lyrics, but Flambae voice actor Lance Cantstopolis ended up deviating from it and improvising a full version of the song heard in the episode’s credits.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, a lot of the stuff is written and nailed down months in advance, and then with some of the actors, you also just kind of go, ‘cool, just give me some of your takes on these different lines,’” Lenart said. “[Cantstopolis is] one of the ones that loves it, and then you just kind of want to like let him loose and just say ‘Do what you want.’ I feel like, with a lot of the actors who recorded, we get four hours of voice files from them at the end; he has probably eight hours of stuff. He’ll just riff on everything and keep going, and it’s sad that it’ll never see the light of day, but it’s hilarious for us just to go through the folders and just listen to all the, all the hilarious stuff he said.”</span></p> <p><span>However, the “Bitch” instrumental Cantstopolis riffs over is a homebrew MIDI made by Lenart because AdHoc “couldn’t pay for the karaoke recording” along with acquiring the rights. When Lenart was syncing Flambae’s vocals to his makeshift instrumental, he found Cantstopolis’ improvised version that made it into the credits.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I was like, ‘Holy crap, this is so funny,”’ Lenart said. “I just started sending it to Chris, Nick, and a bunch of folks like just being like, ‘Isn’t this hilarious? Like, God, he just did the whole thing, and there’s so much great stuff in here.’”</span></p> <h2><b>The devil’s in the details</b></h2> <p><span>Flambae isn’t shown as much in the bar fight itself because the brawl is chaotic enough, and filled with small moments spotlighting each member of the Z-Team. Punch Up uses his short stature to punch the dick of every goon he can, leading to one guy voiced by Rebbert shouting “He’s only punching dicks!” over the noise of the bar. Malevola throws a grunt through a portal after he remarks that he’s “totally into” being choked by her devil tail, and Golem, who isn’t allowed into the bar at first, uses that portal to come and wreck shop with his giant mud-filled arms.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s commitment to its rehabilitated scoundrels’ personalities comes through in most environments, but a bar is also the perfect stage for showcasing a cast of this size, especially when they’re mostly together in a workplace.</span></p> <p><span>“You have a few drinks, you let your guard down, you’re having fun, you loosen up—it’s the antithesis of an office environment,” Rebbert said. “I mean, not that this team by any means behaves properly according to HR protocol, but you know, it’s really we kind of let your hair down. Public houses and watering holes have always been a place where people kind of come together.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000647392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647392"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647392">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The bar was especially helpful in illustrating the contrast between Robert’s stoic, well-mannered heroics and his untamable crew. Lenart points to the clean, local Crypto Night bar seen in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s first episode as a stark contrast between the person Robert has always been and the Sardine’s seedy underbelly he’s trying to navigate now. To the team, this was the best place to finally let Robert and the Z-Team see each other as equals because getting over that barrier wouldn’t be easy.</span></p> <p><span>“The goal of the episode was to have Robert win over the Z-team and cross a relationship barrier with them, for lack of a better way of describing it,” Rebbert said. “It just felt appropriate to put him in enemy territory and make that as hard for him as possible. This is a place that’s their old stomping grounds. He’s an ex-hero.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Despite all of AdHoc’s fears about whether or not the bar fight would work, it’s one of the most memorable sequences in this first season. Lenart says that all that worry was worth it.</span></p> <p><span>“I stuck my neck out for that one,” Lenart said. “I was like, ‘I think this could be funny, we’ll see.’ I think even internally, folks who were used to the original version of the more linear bar fight also had some apprehension internally about it. It was taking a bet of like, ‘Do people think this is funny or really just dumb and annoying?’ I was stressing about that moment for, I don’t know, the last six or seven months. The first playthroughs I was watching, it was like, ‘okay, here we go.’ Then, seeing reactions being positive and people enjoying it, it was like, ‘Now, whatever happens with the rest of the season is fine.’</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight-episode season is available now on PC and PlayStation 5.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-5-bar-fight-scene-making-of-song-prism-2000647373]]></content:encoded>
