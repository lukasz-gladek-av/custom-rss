            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was a standout moment at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-oscars-flute-kojima-ninja-muppets-drdisrespect-2000652237">The Game Awards 2020 showcase</a>. <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> was only three years old and a sequel was coming. More importantly, it starred Vin Diesel in one of the most unforgettable CGI renderings of a human face ever put on screen. Five years later, though, <em>Ark 2</em> is still nowhere in sight and another big delay means it won’t be released until over a decade after the first game at the earliest.</p> <p>At least if you believe it’s still coming out at all. I’m less convinced with each fresh setback. Studio Wildcard cofounder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed at publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-2-ai-trailer-aquatica-survival-snail-wildcard-1851771102">Snail Games’ investor day</a> this week that the new timeline for release is 2028. There’s instead a big update for the existing game coming in late 2027 that will reportedly serve as an introduction to some of the new mechanics and story beats coming in <em>Ark 2</em>.</p>

 <p>“<em>Legacy of Santiago</em> is going to involve a lot of the new fighting and combat mechanics that we want to experiment with, with <em>ARK 2</em>: Soulslike third-person combat, melee combat, and so forth,” Stieglitz said <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">in an interview on the Epic Games Store</a>. “But it’s not going to have all this, like, crazy narrative world build-out content that we want to do with <em>ARK 2</em>, if the mechanics seem to work well with<em>&nbsp;Legacy of Santiago</em>, then the key selling point of&nbsp;<em>ARK 2</em>&nbsp;could be that there is this giant campaign narrative that sits as a standalone product.”</p>

 <p>But plans can change, as they’ve repeatedly done since <em>Ark 2</em>‘s original announcement. The game was first <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/12/2460805/0/en/Studio-Wildcard-Debuts-ARK-2-Trailer-Featuring-Vin-Diesel-Newly-Signed-Auli-i-Cravalho-Plus-Content-Plan-Reveals-for-Acclaimed-ARK-Franchise.html">set to launch in 2023</a>. Then it was pushed to an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-2-survival-evolved-2-delay-ps5-upgrade-servers-1850293672">Early Access release in 2024</a>. That year came and went with no updates. Earlier this year, Stieglitz said <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update">in an interview</a> that he hoped it would arrive in Early Access by 2027 instead. Less than six months later, it’s now coming in 2028. Vin Diesel’s role in the game, which at one point included actually helping to create it, has also been, shall we say, fluid.</p>

 <p><em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em> is currently working with <em>The Boys</em> star Karl Urban, and he might end up taking on a bigger role in<em> Ark 2</em> as well. Vin Diesel’s involvement remains harder to pin down. “The question is: How much performance are we going to get from him?” Stieglitz said this week. “Are we going to get one day, five days, eight hours? You don’t know. And the scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s, if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s 67W USB-C Charger Is Going for Peanuts and Is About the Size of AirPods Pro, Order Now to Get It Before Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-67w-usb-c-charger-is-going-for-peanuts-and-is-about-the-size-of-airpods-pro-order-now-to-get-it-before-christmas-2000654782</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying a separate charger for all your devices – from smartphones to laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches – can be inconvenient, especially if you’re trying to travel light. This is where a multi-port charger can come in handy, and today is a great time to grab one.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of the best portable charging solutions around, as right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/">you can snap its 67W Anker Prime USB-C charger with 3 ports for just $37 at Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice 25% discount. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, plus shipping is free for all shoppers!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>It’s a compact block that’s around 51% smaller than the original 67W MacBook charger. The prongs fold in when not in use, which makes the thing quite easy (and safe) to carry around with you on the go. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though.</p>
<p>The charger comes with a total of three ports, including 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB-A port. These are enough to juice all your essentials up at the same time, whether it’s your phone, laptop, or headphones. Connecting a single device lets you enjoy an efficient output of 67W, while the 65W max two-port charging cuts down on charging time by up to 34%. You won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long, even when powering multiple devices at the same time. The maximum output of 65W is available whether you’re using both USB-C ports or a mix of USB-C and USB-A. Compatibility-wise, the charger plays nicely with a wide range of devices, from iPhone Series 12 to 17, Samsung Galaxy phones, MacBooks, Pixel phones, iPads, and more.</p>



<p>Stability comes from the combination of partially covered pins and an innovative stacked design that keeps the charger firmly in place. GaNPrime Tech, paired with an upgraded ActiveShield 2.0 system, allows for better heat management and increased security, so you won’t have to worry about dealing with overheating, either.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this charger to anyone who is looking for a no-fuss power solution that can juice multiple devices at once. It’s going to be a great addition to work stations. The compact size makes it just as easy to carry around; simply plug it into an outlet in a cafe, coworking space, or the airport, and keep your devices up and running. This deal brings its price down to just $37, which is nothing considering the convenience and peace of mind it gets you. The box comes with the charger itself, a welcome guide, and a worry-free 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Getting your orders in today will help get the charger delivered before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to go on a well-deserved trip during the holidays, and don’t want to carry multiple adapters for a bunch of gadgets.</p>
