              <p>Don’t worry, podracing fans. While <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer’</em>s debut trailer didn’t feature any podracers, the iconic fast-moving space chariots will be a part of the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced last year at the Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is an upcoming racing game set in that galaxy far, far away. <em>Galactic Racer</em> is being developed by some former <em>Burnout</em> devs at Fuse Games, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">a new studio created in 2023</a>. The game looks awesome and features Sebulba at the very end of its teaser trailer. However, there was not a single podracing vehicle to be seen in that first teaser, which had fans like me worried that we wouldn’t get to recreate the best part of 1999’s <em>The Phantom Menace,</em> aka the podracing scene. Thankfully, there will indeed be podracers in <em>Galactic Racer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">In a recent interview with <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> &nbsp;Fuse Games CEO and co-founder Matt Webster told the outlet that yes, of course podracing will be a part of the studio’s <em>Star Wars</em> racing game.</p>  <p id="6d1737fa-b5a4-42f5-8eb9-7604d114ba62">“You can’t really make a <em>Star Wars</em> racing experience and not have podracing, can you?” said Webster. “The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy.”</p>

 <p>“However, when we set out to create <em>Galactic Racer,</em> we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. <em>Galactic Racer</em> offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes.”</p> <p>More good news: <em>Galactic Racer</em> will feature the option to drive around in first-person, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-star-wars-episode-i-racer-remaster-is-a-little-ugl-1844206400">which is my preferred way to play podracing games</a>.&nbsp;Now, I just need Webster or someone else at Fuse Games to confirm the Boonta Eve Classic race course featured in past podracing games, like<em> Star Wars Racer’s Revenge,</em> will be playable in <em>Galactic Racer</em>, and I’ll be a happy wookkiee when the game arrives on consoles and PC later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bad news for anime fans: Popular streaming service Crunchyroll has announced another price increase across all of its tiers, including its cheapest “Fan Tier.” Subscribers will have to pay between $12 and $24 extra a year starting next month. Just one of many services that’s getting more and more expensive.</p> <p>On February 2, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2026/2/2/crunchyroll-updates-membership-pricing-to-give-fans-more-of-what-they-love">Crunchyroll announced</a> that all three of its streaming tiers ( Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan) are getting price increases in the United States on March 4. Here’s what’s changing:</p> <ul> <li>Fan Tier – $9 a month (was $8)</li> <li>Mega Fan Tier – $14 a month (was $12)</li> <li>Ultimate Fan Tier – $18 a month (was $16)</li> </ul> <p>According to Crunchyroll, this is the first time since 2019 that the anime-on-demand service has raised the price of the Fan tier in the U.S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-mega-ultimate-fan-tiers-1851449985">Last time the service raised prices</a> in 2024, the increase didn’t affect the cheapest option, the Fan tier. But that’s not the case this time with next month’s price hike.</p>

 <h2>Why Crunchyroll’s price is going up in March</h2> <p>In an effort to help explain the price increase, Crunchyroll listed some features it’s working on adding or has already recently added to the service. These include profiles for teens, the ability to skip intros and credits, and support for multiple profiles.</p> <p>That’s nice, and I imagine Crunchyroll subscribers have been wanting some of these features for a bit now and are happy to have them or to be getting them in the near future. It doesn’t change that these days it feels like every app, service, subscription, and website is going up in price while not really offering much in exchange.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft recently announced it is raising prices on <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-big-shake-up-just-dance-price-increase-fans-screwed-2000663578">Just Dance’</a></em>s streaming service. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">PlayStation Plus keep going up</a>. PC parts and <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">other tech</a> are<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby"> getting pricier and pricier.</a> In January, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3mdvoguff622z">new data showed</a> that the cost of items sold online has reached a higher point in the past month that at any time in the last 12 years. Welcome to the future: It costs a lot to own anything and just about as much to rent or stream it. Thanks, AI hyperscalers, greedy execs, and tariffs.</p>
