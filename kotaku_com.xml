              <p>Can you feel that chill in the air? Are the trees in your neighborhood shifting shades from verdant greens to crisp reds and oranges? Notice that the sun is setting earlier?

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> Lumiose City-centric story gestures at the darker sides of living in a metropolis, but it usually does so in an all-ages-appropriate way that might not register for the kids playing the RPG. The supposedly harmonious city’s urban redevelopment plan includes </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1izjtjg/future_kalos_has_antihomeless_benches/"><span>anti-homeless benches</span></a><span>? If we’re supposed to be living alongside Pokémon in the Paris-inspired city, why do they live in walled-off Wild Zones? Yeah, they thankfully have free healthcare, but why is Nurse Joy having to take on two jobs as both healer and shopkeeper in this city? Those are questions that hang over a game that is very much trying to figure its world out, but one of the moments of clarity it does have captures how, in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe, cops would absolutely try to enlist these monsters in state-sanctioned violence. No moment captures that better than the “Investigating with Shuppet” quest.</span></p>  <p><span>Rancun, a Lumiose City cop, asks if you can bring him a Shuppet to help with his investigations. In his mind, the ghost-type Pokémon’s ability to sense negative emotions such as jealousy and vindictiveness is something that could help him identify criminals before they have a chance to commit a crime. If you’ve never encountered stories like the cyberpunk anime </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psycho-pass-is-a-compelling-cyberpunk-mystery-and-its-5973624"><i><span>Psycho-Pass</span></i></a><span>, there are entire subgenres of dystopian fiction about how police over-surveilling citizens based almost entirely on vibes can lead to an oppressive police state. And this officer is imagining a world in which he can co-opt an innocent Pokémon into his surveillance scheme and doesn’t see anything wrong with that. But the quest is in our log, so what happens when you bring a Shuppet to Rancun? The funniest outcome, actually.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640502" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640502"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640502">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After you catch a Shuppet and bring the living puppet to Rancun, he tells the ghost that the peace of the city “depends on” it, and asks it to home in on some of these negative emotions it can sense. Funnily enough, Shuppet doesn’t go looking for someone stealing food to help feed their family, but instead takes the cop right back to his own front door. His wife greets us there and asks her husband if he’s still working. When Rancun says that yes, he’s still on a case, she says, seeming slightly annoyed, “Well, I guess you’re still busy with work…Good luck with the investigation.” Before she can head back inside, Shuppet cries out at her, insisting it’s found some negative emotions here. That’s when the truth comes out: It turns out his wife has been feeling neglected by Rancun’s workaholic nature, and has grown resentful. The grudge had grown so strong, in fact, that Shuppet felt it across the city. Rancun decides he should probably devote more energy to his marriage, hopefully indicating that he’s no longer invested in trying to create a Pokémon-powered police state.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has a surprising track record when it comes to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-detective-pikachu-returns-switch-acab-is-a-cop-1850906651"><span>cop commentary</span></a><span>, including the time </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><span>got arrested on false charges</span></a><span> and did a jail break.

              <p>Good morning! Happy Halloween! Yes, kids all around the nation get to enjoy one of life’s best treats: A Friday Halloween. Stay up late, kids, and eat so much candy. But before you wreck your teeth and stomachs, let’s get through today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we have evidence of a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake Xbox port, more layoff news, the reveal of pets in <em>Fortnite</em>, and some new ports of&nbsp;<em>Turok 2&nbsp;</em>arriving courtesy of Nightdive Studios.</p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite</em> adds animal sidekicks</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640494"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640494">©Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">Epic announced</a> that the long-rumored pets feature is finally arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> on November 1 alongside<em> The Simpsons</em> mini-season. These tiny buddies are officially known as “Sidekicks” and will follow you around in battle royale and other <em>Fortnite</em> modes. However, enemy players won’t see them in competitive modes, so your cute puppy doesn’t give away your position and get you killed. Sidekicks will also be immune to damage and will feature their own customization options that can be unlocked by completing quests. I can already hear Epic’s bank account filling with even more money.</p>

 <h2><strong>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is likely coming to Xbox in the near future</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1okrnqd/silent_hill_2_has_been_rated_for_xbox_series_xs/">Folks have spotted</a> an ESRB rating for a yet-to-be-announced Xbox port of last year’s excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This doesn’t officially confirm such a port will happen, but it seems very, very likely that Konami is gearing up to bring the remake to Xbox Series X/S in not too distant future. At the moment, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is only available on PS5 and PC.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS3</em> remake’s multiplayer mode is now available</strong></h2>  <p>When Konami’s fancy remake of M<em>etal Gear Solid 3</em> launched back in August, the game’s promised multiplayer mode was missing as it needed more time in the oven. Now, <em>Fox Hunt</em> is finally out as part of a free update. At launch, <em>Fox Hunt</em> features two stealth-focused multiplayer modes and supports 12 players. While it ain’t a new version of <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, I’m certainly curious to check it out. I mean, once I find time to play it and the 20 other games I still need to play this year.</p> <h2><strong>More layoffs hit Heart Machine</strong></h2> <p>The studio behind <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>and <em>Solar Ash</em> is reportedly laying off employees for the second time this month. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">As reported by <em>GameDeveloper.com</em>,</a> at least four different staff members have recently posted on social media that they were laid off. One now out-of-work dev shared a video suggesting that by the time the studio’s next game, <span data-testid="content-text"><span><em>Possessor(s)</em>, launches on November 11, most, if not all, of the people who worked on it might be gone from the indie studio. This is the second round of layoffs to hit the company this month and the third round in early 2025.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-battlefield-6-skins-silly-cosmetics-crossover-black-ops-7-steam-2000640251"><em>Arc Raiders</em> will avoid silly, immersion-breaking skins</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">Candy prices are going up thanks to President Trump</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-simulator-2-room-interview-pine-studio-2000639908">A wonderful interview with the devs behind <em>Escape Sim 2</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>
