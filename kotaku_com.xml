              <p>Not everybody can afford $500 or $1,000 for an iPad or iPad Pro, but if seeking a decent everyday use alternative, <strong>Amazon’s Fire HD tablets</strong> are certainly well worth a look. They cover all the bases for general use and currently, Amazon is discounting the price by nearly 40% so the <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> is pretty much impossible to ignore: At a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">price that has dropped to $89 from $140</a>, it’s a chance to enjoy a quality tablet without the usual premium.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Tablet that Gets Big Features at a Budget Price</h2>
<p>The Fire HD 10 has <strong>prioritized speed and simplicity</strong> with 25% more performance than its previous generation through an octa-core processor and 3 GB of RAM. It means streaming, reading, browsing and gaming all happen without frustrating lags or delays. Its <strong>10.1-inch full HD screen is rich with clean 1080p images</strong> and brings colors and details in sharp brightness. Whether binge-watching your favorite <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/netflix">Netflix</a> shows or flying through work, the screen makes every frame count.</p>



<p>Battery life is a smart friend in this case as it <strong>lasts up to 13 hours of normal usage</strong>. Yes, extended trips or days without a plug will not leave you stranded. Storing-wise, <strong>there’s 32 GB as base</strong> (expandable with a microSD card up to 1 TB), a whole book collection of apps, videos, and books in your hands. The aluminosilicate reinforced glass toughens the screen and withstands drops better than most of the competition, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8.</p>
<p>The 5 MP front-facing camera is a welcome added feature for day-to-day video chats or social media content creation without needing to use special gear. And when inspiration strikes, the Fire HD 10 supports the Made for Amazon Stylus pen which recognizes over 4,000 levels of pressure for flowing, natural writing or drawing (bit it is sold separately).</p>
<p>If spending a big amount of money on an Apple tablet is not feasible but frequent use of a tablet is, this Fire HD 10 deal is difficult to pass up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors are a game changer when you need some extra screen space but can’t lug around a bulky setup. Picture this: a screen that’s just a bit wider and heavier than a regular notebook in your backpack, giving you plenty of room to work or unwind wherever you are. This <strong>Arzopa 16.1″ portable monitor fits right into that sweet spot</strong>. And the best part? Amazon is running an early Prime Day deal that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/">slashes the price to about $76 after a 30% coupon, down from around $110</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger Screen and Brighter Colors</h2>
<p>This Arzopa design has also bumped up the screen size from 15.6 inches (which is typical for so many portable monitors) to 16.1 inches. That extra inch of screen space makes more of a difference than you might think: i<strong>t gives you a more natural 16:9 ratio</strong> that is easier on the eyes and perfect for streaming your favorite shows.</p>
<p>Quality is not just a matter of size. The monitor uses an I<strong>PS panel with crisp 1080p full HD resolution</strong>. It also gains color accuracy with a comprehensive 100% sRGB gamut that renders images with rich, real-life colors. Thanks to a 1000:1 contrast ratio, dark areas are deep and detailed and the light areas glow, a wonderful option for anything from creative work to Netflix bingeing.</p>



<p><strong>At 1.7 pounds and 0.35 inches thin</strong>, this monitor is easily stashed away in bags. Its slivers of a bezel pack more screen into smaller space, and the <strong>fold-out kickstand</strong> so you don’t require any other hardware to prop it up.</p>
<p><strong>Both USB-C and mini HDMI connections</strong> let you plug it into laptops, phones, game systems, and more at a snap. There are a few display options like duplicate, extend, or as a second display, so you can configure your workflow or entertainment center without a single hassle. Plug and play is trouble-free as it plays right away out of the box.</p>
<p>If you’ve been craving a little more screen real estate, this early Prime Day deal is a perfect chance to grab one of the most premium portable monitor without a hefty price tag.</p>

              <p>Portable power stations are<strong> basically power banks amplified</strong> designed to charge all your devices and even serve as back-up power in case of a power outage. They’re really handy, surprisingly light and convenient to take with you wherever you go. Today, on the eve of Prime Day,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/"> Amazon has slashed the price on the Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2) to an all-time low of only $448, down from its normal $799</a> which is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for trustworthy portable power on the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Bank That Travels Everywhere</h2>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a portable powerhouse that can pack serious punch without weighing you down. Its 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery life means you have enough juice to <strong>power multiple appliances like your AC unit, refrigerator, or electric stove</strong>, making it a camp lifesaver, road trip companion or emergency power outage rescuer. All that power and yet it <strong>only weighs 23.8 pounds</strong> and comes with a foldable handle so you can simply grab and leave whenever.</p>
<p>One of the things that is truly awesome is the <strong>1,500W continuous AC output and 3,000W surge power</strong> which makes it possible for it to start devices that need a pre-initial power boost and keep them running effectively. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver which allows you to charge the entire device from zero to full in as little as one hour when you’re using emergency charging through the Jackery App. Typically, <strong>the unit charges in approximately 1.7 hours</strong> to maintain battery health, trading speed for smart care with the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology.</p>



<p>With <strong>two USB-C, one USB-A, a DC automobile port, and three true sine wave AC outlets</strong>, the Explorer 1000 can power an array of devices simultaneously (smartphones, laptops, cameras, and even small appliances). The 100W USB-C Power Delivery port assures rapid charging of compatible devices without requiring cumbersome power adapters, further enhancing the convenience in being able to go anywhere or respond to unforeseen power failures in your home.</p>
<p>If there was ever a time to take advantage of a portable power station that will never let you down, that time is now with this record-low price.</p>

              <p>Having a Xbox but not enough controllers kind of kills the fun, especially when playing with friends and family. What makes the console truly cool is those multiplayer moments, and nothing beats sharing the game with extra controllers on hand. The catch? Controllers aren’t always the easiest or cheapest to grab. That’s why timing your buy is key, and right now there’s a Black Friday-level deal on Amazon that’s too good to miss: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">latest Xbox wireless gaming controller is available for $53, down from its original $64</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Contemporary Design Coupled with Comforting Play and Intelligent Features</h2>
<p>Its modernized design features sculpted surfaces and refined geometry that fit comfortably in your hands, and keeps you gaming longer without fatigue. The textured grip on the triggers, bumpers and back case is there to make sure your fingers stay steady and controlled. And the new hybrid D-pad adds precise directional control which is a big deal whether you’re navigating tricky menus or battling opponents.</p>
<p>The <strong>Share button is perhaps the best feature of them all since it lets you snap and share your gameplay</strong>—screenshots, video, whatever—without breaking stride. It’s a simple way to share with friends or easily record your best victories.</p>



<p>The controller supports Xbox Wireless and Bluetooth which makes it simple to connect to many devices. If you’re playing on your Xbox console, alternating to playing with your Windows computer, launching games on Android or iOS, or even attaching it with Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, or VR headsets, this controller lags behind none. With so much flexibility, you won’t need to keep multiple different controllers occupying valuable space.</p>
<p>And, to boot, players also have a lot of selection with sound: The <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> will work with any supported headset, so you can simply plug in and talk or be completely enveloped in the game’s sound. The <strong>USB-C port</strong> lets you plug directly into your Xbox or PC for plug-and-play installation which is perfect if you are enthusiastic about a wired connection or charging during gaming.</p>
<p>All things considered, snagging this controller at $53 is a smart move whether you’re replacing an older one or expanding your multiplayer setup.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last week, a war has been waging in the YouTube comments of each new <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> trailer as the PlayStation 5 exclusive nears its release date early next month. That’s because a developer at Sucker Punch Productions<a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"> joked about the assassination of Charlie Kirk</a> on social media. Sony confirmed it had parted ways with the employee following a right-wing pressure campaign, but declined to issue any further statement. Now studio head and co-founder Brian Fleming has commented on the firing directly in a new interview.</p> <p>Sucker Punch artist Drew Harrison, a nearly 10-year veteran of the studio, posted “I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back” on the day the assassination took place. Less than 24 hours later she confirmed she’d been fired. “Drew Harrison is no longer an employee of Sucker Punch Productions,” a spokesperson for Sony told <em>Kotaku</em> at the time.</p> <p>“The facts are accurate,” Fleming told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei">Stephen Totilo’s <em>Game File</em></a> when asked about the situation. “Drew’s no longer an employee here. I think we’re aligned as a studio that celebrating or making light of someone’s murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms. That’s sort of our studio, and that’s kind of where we are.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627297"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627297">YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Despite Harrison’s swift firing, angry internet users, urged on by clout-chasing culture warriors like Mark “Grummz” Kern, have been demanding Sony take action against any staff members who may have liked or reposted Harrison’s comment, while also targeting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">other companies and their employees</a> over potential anti-Kirk sentiment. That included Bethesda, which was accused of mocking the right-wing podcast’s supporters when it posted a clip from <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> of the famous Nazi puncher saying to a kitten, “You don’t care much about these fascists, do you?” <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-charlie-kirk-tweet-deleted/">It was later deleted</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft Gaming employees were also targeted, including by Elon Musk. “We’re aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Microsoft/status/1966626714148368766">announced</a> in response on September 12. “We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation. Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values.” A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when asked if anyone had been fired from Microsoft following these investigations.</p> <p>“Sucker Punch is amazing &amp; one of the last few bright shining lights in the game industry,” Harrison posted this week. “I still support them and I cannot condone any animosity directed at them. It’s truly all the best people.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-tips-to-know-before-playing-borderlands-4.1303068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is a very big and mostly great game</a> that you’ll likely spend over 50 hours in if you try to do everything it has to offer. It also might be your first <em>Borderlands</em> in a long time, or possibly ever. This all might seem really intimidating. 10 billion guns! A giant open world! What should you do? Well, I’ve got your back. Here are 12 tips to help you get started and kick ass in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> And be not afraid, there are no spoilers below.</p> <h2>Don’t Get Distracted By Side Quests Until You Get Your Hover Bike</h2> <p>Look, I get it. Running around and doing every little side quest is fun, but I’d recommend focusing on the main story until you get your hoverbike. It won’t take more than two hours and it’s worth it. Well, unless you like walking everywhere in a big open-world game. And speaking of side quests and not doing them…</p> <h2>Maybe Don’t Do <em>Every</em> Side Quest Before Finishing The Main Story…</h2> <p>I’m a map cleaner in open-world games. I get it. I love to methodically clear out every piece of content in a big open world. But maybe don’t do that until you complete the main story. That’s because once you do that, regardless of your level, you unlock “Specializations,” which is a new set of passive bonuses and skills that act as an endgame grind. And you level this up with XP. So it might be better to mainline the story and then turn around and do all the side stuff later.</p>

 <h2>But…Focus On Getting SDU Credits To Make Your Backpack Bigger</h2> <p>While I advise not doing every side quest before the credits roll, I do suggest you look out for Propaganda Towers, Bunkers, and other open-world activities that reward you with SDU credits that can be used to upgrade how many items you can hold at once in your backpack. Trust me, you want to upgrade this ASAP. You are going to be grabbing so much random junk to sell and sort through, and running out of space sucks. So prioritize getting that backpack upgraded.</p> <h2>Use The Loot As Junk Button</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">New to <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the ability to loot items as junk.</a> This means that you can instantly sell it and every single item you’ve marked as junk with the press of a button just by walking up to a vending machine. It saves a lot of time and is one of the best features in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Use it. You’ll thank me later.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Keep An Eye Open For Elemental Weapons To Help You Kill Quickly</h2> <p>It’s very easy to focus exclusively on getting guns with bigger numbers. But hold up! It’s not all about DPS. You might want to keep that SMG or shotgun because of its elemental damage type. You see, enemies in<em> Borderlands 4</em> all have different weaknesses to different elements. Enemies with red health bars burn fast, baddies with blue health bars are weak to shock, and aliens or robots with yellow health bars get melted quickly with acid.</p> <p>So before you drop that slightly weaker SMG for a cool new one, stop and think. Does the weaker one do acid damage? Is it your only weapon that does acid damage? You might want to keep it, then, so you can fight robots with ease.</p>

 <h2>Don’t Have Four Of The Same Type Of Gun Equipped</h2> <p>I love a good assault rifle in<em> Borderlands 4.</em> I’m always on the lookout for a new Daedalus AR to add to my collection. But I never run around with more than one AR equipped. Why? Because if all your guns are the same type–like all shotguns or whatever–then you’ll burn through that ammo type much faster. Variety is the spice of life, and it also means you don’t use up all your shotgun shells in a matter of minutes.</p> <h2>Look Down Your Character’s Skill Tree Before Unlocking Anything</h2> <p>Simple one, but important: Before you start upgrading your character’s skills, take a moment to look at what you’ll be able to unlock later on. You might see a skill you just desperately want, or you might realize the particular skill tree you are examining features bonuses and abilities you’ll just never use. And sure, the game lets you respec everything, but why waste time earning skills you don’t like when you can take a moment to plan ahead and have a much better time.</p>

 <h2>When Playing Co-op, Use Your Buddies As Fast Travel Stations</h2> <p>Playing with your friends is always better, but in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Borderlands 4</a>,</em> that’s especially true as you can fast-travel to them whenever you want. Tricky platforming section that you don’t want to do? Fast travel to your bud! Get lost and can’t find your way to the next part of the quest? Fast travel to your friend. Want to sell a bunch of stuff in the middle of a big fight? Fast travel to an area with vending machines, sell your junk, and then fast travel back to your friends. This feature is so useful and powerful that it almost feels like cheating.</p> <h2>Use The Newly Added Repkits!</h2> <p>It’s easy to forget about <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s newly added Rep Kits, which are small items that can heal you during fights. They are brand new to the franchise and the game never warns you to use one when your health gets low. But use your Rep Kits! They can make a challenging ambush much easier.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>If Lost, Just Use Echo 4, aka Hit Up On The D-Pad</h2> <p>Remember, you can always ask Echo 4, your new robot companion, to guide you to your next quest objective or your custom marker. This can be really handy when deep in a cave or building filled with multiple rooms and hallways. Just hit up on the D-pad, and Echo 4 will generate an easy-to-follow holographic line in the world pointing to your target location.</p> <h2>Grab Contracts Before Heading Out</h2> <p>Whenever you return to one of the many hub and town areas in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, take a moment to check the bounty board and grab some bounties. Many of these are very easy to complete and just want you to kill a few random enemies. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get some extra XP and rewards for doing so?</p>

 <h2>Hold Onto Gold Keys Until You Level Up</h2> <p>The moment you walk up to your first gold chest in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you’ll be tempted to use any gold keys you currently have. Don’t do this. I know, it’s fun to open a big shiny box and get new guns, most of which will be pretty good. But if you’re below level 40, I’d avoid using your keys as the loot you get from them at that point will be made worthless in the not-too-distant future. That level 7 legendary sniper ain’t going to be worth using when, a few hours later, you’re level 12 and find a much better one. Save your gold keys for when you’re in the endgame portion of <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>And if you need help getting more (or any…) gold keys, don’t you worry,<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-shift-codes-gold-keys-work-borderlands-4-help-get-more-2000626107"> I’ve got a guide just for you</a> that walks you through the process and even includes some codes you can use to get some fancy rewards.</p>

              <p>Screens can quickly become a source of frustration. Attempting to work on a small laptop screen is claustrophobic, gaming on the Nintendo Switch isn’t the most immersive gaming experience, and even gaming consoles such as PlayStation or Xbox sometimes leave you wishing for a more delineated or flexible screen setup.</p>
<p>That’s where a portable monitor changes the story. The <em>Forhelp</em> 15.6‑inch portable monitor provides a crisp 1080p display and a thin profile that you can take wherever you go, putting an end to all those screen frustrations at once. Even better, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/">Amazon has cut it down to just $59 (from $79), which happens to be its all-time low</a>.</p>

<h2>A Portable Screen That Travels With You</h2>
<p>What we love about this monitor is how much it manages to pack into such a compact body: <strong>Measuring only 0.3 inches thin and weighing slightly over 1.5 pounds</strong>, it slides perfectly into a backpack alongside your laptop or console. The aluminum alloy body adds strength and premium feel and the included magnetic smart case also doubles as a durable stand. You can stand it on a desk, an airplane tray table or a hotel nightstand with ease, and you still have some choice of viewing angles thanks to the grooves molded into the cover.</p>



<p>The screen is a Full HD 1920×1080 IPS display with a matte finish, so you have rich and true color, a wide 178‑degree viewing angle and less reflection. It even minimizes blue light emissions and eliminates flicker to make long sessions that much more comfortable on the eyes. Image quality is sufficient for this price to immerse you in movies and games and let you forget that compromised feeling when you’re not on your main display.</p>
<p>The monitor features two fully functional USB‑C ports and a mini HDMI port so you can connect it directly to a laptop, Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch with a single cable. Thunderbolt 3/4 and USB‑C DisplayPort Alt Mode‑enabled devices will also power the monitor without the need for adapters so you’re ready to go in no time when working on the go. It’s designed for work and play and includes a number of modes to match how you’re utilizing it. You can mirror your laptop screen during a meeting, extend your desktop for real productivity gains, or use second screen mode on the move.</p>
<p>Two built‑in speakers add audio on the fly without needing external accessories. They won’t rival a dedicated speaker setup but they handle gaming sessions or movies smoothly enough to make this monitor truly self‑contained.</p>



<p>What makes this deal hard to ignore is how much you’re getting at this price. Most travel monitors with a decent IPS panel, multiple connections, and a sleek aluminum case are more expensive, typically $100 or more. Here, for $59, you have a travel‑friendly second screen that can do double duty for productivity work and gaming rigs. Make sure you don’t miss this opportunity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night on <em>The Tonight Show</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-latest-chapter-in-jimmy-fallons-ongoing-love-affair-1789194585"><em>Mario Kart</em> superfan</a> Jimmy Fallon did what Jimmy Fallon does best: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gma4TPZCXg">chuckle at his own jokes, make funny faces, and shrug his shoulders</a>. While he didn’t shy away from dunking on Donald Trump’s trip to the UK, he did pull his punches when talking about late night TV’s other Jimmy getting bullied off the air by a rogue president, his FCC goon squad, and a complicit c-suite. “To be honest with you all, I don’t know what’s going on, and no one does,” Fallon told viewers. That last part, at least, is an obvious lie. Why Jimmy Kimmel was kicked off the air by ABC is not complicated or confusing. Part of what’s so galling about it is just how stupid, craven, and obvious what happened is, and how none of that stopped it from happening.</p> <p>Jimmy Kimmel was kicked off the air for making fun of Trump. Not because he joked about Charlie Kirk’s assassination, which he didn’t do, or because he lied about it, which he didn’t do either. Comments about the “MAGA gang” trying to score political points off Kirk’s murder were just the setup to a punchline about how Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-jimmy-kimmel-said-late-night-show-charlie-kirk-2025-9">can’t even muster a crocodile tear</a> over the right-wing podcaster’s death before gushing about his White House renovations. You can watch the tape. You can read the transcript. There is no ambiguity in what transpired, even as pundits paid to make hay of the controversy try to hedge by condemning something Kimmel didn’t say while advocating for a First Amendment that wasn’t directly violated.</p> <p>That’s because ABC, and it’s corporate owner Disney, rushed to comply before it even got to that point. One of the biggest TV operators in the country, Nexstar Media Group, is trying to buy another operator called Tegna in a deal valued at over $6 billion and that would require the approval of Trump’s Justice Department. Along with conservative network affiliate owner Sinclair, Nexstar announced it would stop carrying <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </em>(Nexstar <a href="https://t.co/ghiH7Zo0GP">denies</a> this was the reason.) FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatened to investigate ABC and pull its broadcast licenses over Kimmel’s monologue. And then Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden and CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-decision-disney-dana-walden-bob-iger-1236547651/">decided to preemptively pull the plug</a>, provoking a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">celebrity-led boycott in the process</a>.</p>

 <p>Trump has been desperately trying to get Kimmel fired for months. Shortly after Paramount sacrificed Stephen Colbert to get its merger approved with Skydance, the president made this as clear as possible. “Jimmy Kimmel is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes and, shortly thereafter, Fallon will be gone,” he posted in July. Anyone who keeps acting surprised by what’s going on, like Fallon, just hasn’t been paying attention or, worse, thinks that they can save themselves by trying to pretend none of it is happening. Even ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner is going, in so many words, “<a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363">Wait, what the fuck is happening</a>?”</p> <p>Maybe that’s why it felt strangely nostalgic and refreshing to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GXNJ3V9lzg">Jon Stewart</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdGLJly6P7c">Stephen Colbert</a> last night, each tackling Kimmel’s firing in their own ways but in no uncertain terms. Like a lot of people, I watched <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em> a lot in college. Then I stopped. At some point the formula began to feel not only cringe but aimless. The news was getting grimmer and the stakes less funny. But last night reminded me what worked about them all those years ago. It’s cathartic to watch people call out obvious bullshit, especially when so many others keep running away from it, anxiously looking to their colleagues and bosses to make sure they don’t step out of line, even when the line is drawn by a dangerous buffoon. That’s how the Bush years felt. Nothing’s changed and yet now somehow it’s even worse.</p> <p>“I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he’s a decent, funny, and loving guy, and I hope he comes back,” Fallon said last night. It is, of course, not up to Kimmel if he comes back. Fallon knows that. He also knows he could be next. And that cynical calculus is what will make sure he’s not the last.</p>
