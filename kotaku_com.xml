              <p>During today’s Pokémon Presents, The Pokémon Company finally revealed the very leaked games <em>Pokémon Winds</em> and <em>Waves</em>. The games are set in a very aquatic region, revealing swamps, oceans and marinas, with what’s clearly a hugely improved engine to boot.</p> <p>Announced only for the Switch 2 (inevitably disappointing a lot of people, but also perhaps necessary if Game Freak is to escape the continued criticism of its crummy graphics), the next pair of mainline games won’t be coming out until 2027. That means it will have been an unprecedented five years between two main <em>Pokémon</em> games for the first time in the series’ 30-year history.</p>

  <p>What we saw in this reveal trailer showed us a much wetter world than we’re used to in the franchise, and very clearly the ability to go underwater as part of play. How else are we going to reach those Krabby?</p> <p>That’s likely a big part of why this will be on Switch 2 only, given the water effects would have an original Switch emitting smoke and then burning down your house. Beyond that, we’ve been told very little about what will make this game distinct, especially as the only new monsters we’ve seen are the three new starters.</p>

 <p>The announcement of 2027 is a huge surprise, given these games were originally expected to appear in 2025. It seemed a given they’d be holiday 2026 releases, not least to give the Switch 2 another Christmas bump, but the ambiguous “2027” means they could still be as much as 22 months away if they stick to their usual time of year.</p>

 <p>This at least means we can now begin the process of gathering all the droplets of information that will appear, especially the gradual announcement of all the new pocket monsters to meet in Gen X.</p>

              <p>It’s February 27, and that means it’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary. As it does every year on this day, The Pokémon Company held a livestream to talk about upcoming projects and updates to ongoing games like&nbsp;<em>Go</em>,&nbsp;<em>Masters EX</em>, and <em>Trading Card Pocket</em>. If you weren’t able to catch the show live, you can watch it below, or keep scrolling to check out the highlights.</p>  <h2>Game Music Collection</h2> <p>After a big ol’ montage of footage from just about every mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game and some words from Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara, the show kicked off announcing what looks like some kind of music player based on the original Game Boy that plays different songs from the original games with swappable cartridges that look like <em>Pokémon Red </em>and&nbsp;<em>Blue</em>. All right, weird way to start, but go off.</p>

 <h2>World Championships and Pokémon XP</h2> <p>The stream then recapped the details on its upcoming in-person events in San Francisco, both the World Championships tournament, and the fan event taking place from August 28 to 30. No real new info, but in case you forgot it’s coming up, there ya go.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em></h2> <p>All right, now we’re getting to the games. The first in the showcase was <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em>, which is getting new cards celebrating the 30th anniversary later this year.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Go</em></h2>  <p><em>Pokémon Go</em>‘s 10th anniversary is this year, and the AR game is bringing back previously phased-out monsters to celebrate.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Masters EX</em></h2>  <p>The classic iteration of Red, the main character from the original games, is joining the gacha game as a sync pair alongside his Pikachu. New versions of Florian and Juliana, the protagonists of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>, are also joining the game with Ogerpon and Terapagos respectively.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Cafe Remix</em></h2>  <p>The puzzle/management sim game is hosting an event in which you can recruit all the starter Pokémon from the first nine generations, as well as adding new outfits, Pokémon, and 30th anniversary decorations for your shop.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Sleep</em></h2>  <p>Mew missions are coming to the&nbsp;<em>Sleep&nbsp;</em>app tonight, and the teaser hinted that Latias and Latios will join as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Unite</em></h2> <p>The MOBA announced several new additions to its roster, including Articuno, Moltres, and Zapdos, as well as all three of the Johto starters: Meganium, Feraligatr, and Typhlosion.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em></h2> <p>A new card set called Paldean Wonders is coming to&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, which spotlights Pokémon and characters from <em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em></h2> <p><em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>, one of the more obscure RPGs from the GameCube era, is coming to Nintendo Switch Online, but only on Switch 2. This will be nice for people who haven’t been able to track down a copy, which typically costs way too goddamn much. It will be available next month.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</em></h2>  <p><em>FireRed&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen&nbsp;</em>are coming to Switch and Switch 2 after the presentation, and they will be compatible with storage app <em>Pokémon Home </em>so you can transfer your monsters to other games. This compatibility will be coming at a later date.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Champions</em></h2>  <p>Next we got a new look at&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Champions</em>, the upcoming battle simulator for Switch consoles and mobile, which will be the first time Mega Evolutions from&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em> like Raichu and Hawlucha will be playable in the usual competitive format. It’s coming to Switch consoles in April, with a mobile version coming later this year.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>–&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension</em></h2>  <p>After hiding in the code for months, Mega Garchomp Z is finally coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>as a free update after the stream provided&nbsp;you have the&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>DLC . This will give you a new quest that will unlock the new Mega Stone.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></h2>  <p>We’re a week away from&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>‘s launch, and it’s bringing another new form for an old Pokémon with DJ Rotom, a stereo version of the ghost Pokémon that possesses technology, which will play music from across the franchise’s many games. We also met other new characters like Chef Dente, a Greedent that cooks for your town. The show also revealed some more multiplayer footage, which included what looks like a Prop Hunt mode that lets you play hide-and-seek while transforming into items to disguise yourself. The game is coming to Switch 2 on March 5.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Winds </em>and <em>Waves</em></h2>  <p>Closing out the show is the reason we all showed up.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Winds </em>and&nbsp;<em>Waves </em>are the next mainline RPGs in the series, kicking off Generation X. In this first footage we see players running through a large open world with different ecosystems mostly filled with old monsters. But we did also meet the new starters: the grass-type Browt, the fire-type Pombon, and the water-type Gecqua. The games will come to Switch 2 in 2027.</p>
