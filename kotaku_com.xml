              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-creepypasta-what-is-backrooms-tiktok-steam-reddit-1850298058">Liminal spaces and the “backrooms”</a> have become overused concepts on the internet, with people labeling any room or area that is even slightly off as some creepy space. It’s annoying and tiring. But I still like the idea of eerie, dead areas hidden in our world in places like forgotten hallways and empty hotel rooms. I also like fast-paced boomer shooters that feel great. So I’m a big fan of the newly released indie FPS <em>Oddcore</em>, which mashes all of this stuff up into one stylish game.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896260/ODDCORE/?curator_clanid=4777282">Out now on Steam via early access, <em>Oddcore</em></a> doesn’t have much setup. One moment you’re hanging out in a room in your house, watching TV, before you suddenly clip through reality and enter a strange multidimensional hubworld called Oddcore that acts as a demented spin on a theme park. Sort of. It’s all very, well, dare I say…odd! Though it’s unclear why you’ve ended up here or what “here” even means, it doesn’t really matter much once you get past the tutorial. All that matters is lasting as long as you can as you hop between different liminal spaces and strange dimensions, killing all the bizarre monsters you encounter along the way with guns, swords, special abilities, and much, much more.</p>

 <h2>What kind of game is <em>Oddcore</em>?</h2> <p>The basic loop in <em>Oddcore</em> involves you hopping into a space and then completing an objective. It might be to kill 10 enemies. Or collect seven strange items. Or to survive a corruption ambush that sends deadly giant faces at you. You know, the usual stuff. Survive, and you hop to a new place and repeat. Killing enemies earns you souls, which can be spent to extend how much time you have before your run ends or to heal you via shooting your own feet. Between every few worlds, there are vending machines that let you upgrade your gear or abilities, and random boxes that contain power-ups and other useful specials.</p>

  <p>Survive long enough, and you’ll earn tokens which can be spent in various ways. I spent most of mine at a slot machine inside a large arcade in the hub world. That slot machine spit out tickets if I got lucky, and I could use those to buy other pieces of gear. There’s actually a lot going on in <em>Oddcore</em>, and after just an hour or so of playing, I could feel it start to pull me into its web. I wanted to do just one more run…earn just a few more tokens…play just a little bit more.</p>

 <p>It also helps that <em>Oddcore</em> has primo aesthetics. It’s got that retro boomer shooter look I’ve come to expect from these kinds of games in 2026, but augments that with monsters and locations that seem out of place. I recommend turning on the VHS filter as it covers all of the strange art and retro visuals in cozy scanlines that add to the experience. But even without the VHS filter, <em>Oddcore</em> is a damn fine indie shooter that will hopefully only get bigger and better as it makes its way through early access.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation’s YouTube Channel Shares The Good News About Ebola Village, Which Definitely Isn’t A Bad Resident Evil Knock-Off]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-ebola-village-ps5-trailer-youtube-steam-2000657809</link>
            <guid>1400014</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Listen, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290"><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i></a> <span>is clearly an influential series. It helped mold the enduring vision of survival-horror video games, and over the course of its nearly 30-year history, it has reinvented itself and the genre more times than one can count. There’s even an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><span>exciting new </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> title</span></a><span> coming out right around the series’ 30th anniversary, which feels like an appropriate thing to promote and throw some weight behind. So explain to me why, instead, there’s a </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> knockoff called </span><i><span>Ebola Village </span></i><span>taking up time and space on PlayStation’s YouTube page right now?</span></p> <p><span>The trailer’s description reads, “A classic horror inspired by the original survival games of the 90s, Ebola Village is a modern take on a first-person adventure where the main character, Maria, investigates a series of mysterious events.” Let me just say, “inspired” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. It’s been sitting on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRM0AdPcs3E">PlayStation YouTube page</a> for over 20 hours, has amassed over 70,000 views, and roughly 7,400 downvotes. It was spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/2008707623428792711">social media gaming news accounts like Knoebel</a>. “</span><span dir="auto" role="text">What are we doing here man,” reads one of the top comments.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span><em>Ebola Village</em> already released on PC last year. Part of an entire series developed by “indie_games_studio” (yes, that’s the studio’s name), it costs $17 dollars and the top Steam reviews say things like, “This game is so bad it gave me Ebola irl.” Usually, it’s Unreal Engine asset-flip knockoffs of hit Steam games that are wasting space on the PlayStation Store. This time around, it’s actual junk from Steam that appears to be flowing downstream. How it ended up with a spot on the PlayStation YouTube channel remains unclear.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The entire trailer feels like a shoddily constructed homage to the </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> series, and not in a campy, fun way, either. One of the opening shots shows a character driving into town, and from the first-person perspective of the scene, their fingerless gloves look almost exactly like part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-grace-playable-split-2000653406"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a><span>‘s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span> fit. In another scene, a zombie (or someone otherwise infected by Ebola???) lobs an axe at the player’s head, and I swear the accompanying sound effect even sounds like it’s straight out of </span><i><span>RE4</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if this trailer will be still available on the official PlayStation YT acc after I wake up tomorrow. <a href="https://t.co/9CKCMwnle8">pic.twitter.com/9CKCMwnle8</a></p> <p>— Knoebel (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/2008707623428792711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make matters worse (or better depending on who you ask), there’s also an enemy with a chainsaw and sack over their head. Come on, y’all.</span></p> <p><i><span>RE4</span></i><span> isn’t the only game from the series that’s shown a bit of love here, and there are some standout “homages” to the larger </span><i><span>RE </span></i><span>series among the various egregious details. For example, the font used for </span><i><span>Ebola Village</span></i><span>‘s title appears very similar to that used by the </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> remakes, and the “E” in Ebola here is crimson followed by gnarled white lettering, mirroring the logos for those games. Additionally, the main character, Maria, feels pretty “inspired”</span> <span>by the series’ early female protagonists, like some amalgamation of Claire Redfield and Jill Valentine.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At some point in the game, Maria even appears to flee to a remote village to “visit her mother and her ex-husband, Ruslan,” at which point the game begins to look eerily like the </span><i><span>RE4</span></i><span>-inspired </span><i><span>Resident Evil Village</span></i><span>. There’s a tall crone-like character, a fight with a werewolf, and there are even scenes set amongst distinctly </span><i><span>Village</span></i><span>-esque cabins. The most surprising part of the trailer is actually the absence of a Lady Dimitrescu analog, but maybe that’s one surprise <em>Ebola Village</em> is saving for those brave enough to actually spend money on it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some commenters on the trailer page couldn’t help but theorize that the video’s thumbnail was AI-generated, which would at least feel in line with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494"><span>rest of the slop currently sitting on the PlayStation Store</span></a><span>. According to the game’s Steam page, it was indeed the work of a neural network. </span><i><span>Ebola Village</span></i><span> is evidently releasing on console on January 23, and I cannot wait to see what </span><i><span>borrowed </span></i><span>tricks it has up its sleeves, at least until <em>Ebola 4</em> comes out. We’ll see if that one makes it into an actual PlayStation showcase.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for my favorite Pokémon to get a Mega Evolution, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> finally gave it to me. I dove headlong into the RPG upon release, spending every spare moment I could in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246#:~:text=the%20citizens%20of-,Lumiose%20City,-.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20Pidgey"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, but now that I’m nearly done with everything the game has to offer, I’m starting to feel my running and jumping through the streets of its Paris-inspired setting shift to a light jog.&nbsp; As I catch the last few monsters in the expansion’s dex and cross off the remaining sidequests, my steps slow as I wait for my Mega Raichu, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>flying behind me like he’s Superman, to catch up</span></a><span>, savoring a few more seconds with his golden, two-tailed, superpowered form.</span></p> <p><span>A friend of mine who also happens to be one of the biggest </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans I’ve ever known was visiting me in New York City a few months back, and I was surprised to learn that she hadn’t finished 2024’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i></a><span>, despite being positive on it. She explained that, especially after everything that’s happened to BioWare in the past year, she felt like seeing the credits roll on this latest entry would mean the end of a “moment” of her life, as </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>future seems murky</span></a><span> at best. I kind of understood, but part of me is also of the mind that seeing something through to the end is only half the experience. Sitting with it and examining its complexities is just as important. But eventually, you exhaust yourself of all that reflection and move on to something else. My reluctance to put </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>in the rearview mirror is helping me understand where she was coming from, and why people often opt not to finish games they deeply admire and enjoy. It is comforting knowing that you haven’t hit that endpoint yet, even if it means you’re depriving yourself of something you love.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve been writing about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>for months here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and I can feel that part of me that loves to critically analyze and engage with these games preparing to move on as next month’s inevitable Generation X announcement on Pokémon Day approaches. This game has been a really compelling experiment , letting Game Freak play around with real-time battles and a single-city setting, and I truly wish the studio would release another major DLC expansion or </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> to keep it going. But I also recognize it’s done what it needed to do. I don’t need more for more’s sake. In fact, with most video game franchises, I prefer things to go away forever after they’ve run their course.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657801"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657801">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a weird outlier for me on that front as I’m always down to explore a new place in this universe, and since Game Freak took a year without a new game or DLC pack in 2024, the gap between </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s expansions and </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> felt painfully long. So even if </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>hadn’t given Raichu two much needed Mega Evolutions, I would have been squeezing every drop of Pokéjuice out of this game. But on top of that, my superhero rat just got here, and I would be surprised if Mega Evolution showed up in the next pair of RPGs we’re probably getting our first glimpse of next month.</span></p>

 <p><span>I put over 120 hours into </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> and its DLC. I had Mega Raichu by my side for about 60 of those hours, and that still doesn’t feel like enough. Raichu and I will inevitably meet up again in the next game, but it sure hurts knowing I waited all this time to have him Mega Evolve just for it to only last a couple of months before we move on. Lumiose City may not be pretty to look at, but I still love hanging out with its weird citizens who say odd shit and love this metropolis with all their heart. I’m not ready to say goodbye just yet.</span></p>

 <p><span>So now, to make it last just a little bit longer, all I can do is bide my time. I’m booting up my Switch 2 less often. I’m doing menial tasks and wandering in places I’ve already seen dozens of times. As long as there’s an incomplete quest or a Pokémon I haven’t added to my Pokédex, I have a reason to come back. The knowledge that it’s not over is somehow more comforting than having one less game on my backlog list.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Reveals Some Of Its Coolest-Looking PS5 Controllers Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-reveals-some-of-its-coolest-looking-ps5-controllers-ever-2000657781</link>
            <guid>1399885</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Consoles used to come in fun colors, sometimes with transparent shells and other wild features. Those days are long gone, and now we mostly get stuck with black and white consoles with a few limited color options for accessories. So I’m happy to see Sony announcing some genuinely cool-looking console covers and controllers for the PlayStation 5 arriving in March.</p> <p>On January 7, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">PlayStation unveiled its Hyperpop Collection</a>, which features three vibrant new PS5 console covers and controllers. You can get a PS5 shell or Dualsense gamepad in Techno Red, Remix Green, and/or Rhythm Blue. Silly names aside, these console shells look awesome, sporting a gradient design that goes from black on the top to a vibrant color at the bottom, assuming you have your PS5 standing up next to your TV.</p>

  <p>However, what I really find exciting are the three new controllers, which also sport the same black to color gradient pattern. These things look sick as heck, and I want one right now to replace the boring black Dualsense controller I’ve been using for a bit now.</p>

 <p>Sony says the console covers will cost $75, and the Hyperpop Dualsense controllers will be priced at $85. That’s $10 more than a standard Dualsense, which is annoying. But that gradient design is soooo good that I’m willing to pay the extra price. I’ll just consider it a cool tax.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a bit before I can get my hands on that Remix Green Dualsense controller. The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12, 2026, with Sony starting pre-orders for the slick-looking hardware on January 16, 2026 at select retailers and on PlayStation’s official store.</p>
