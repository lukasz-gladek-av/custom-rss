              <p>VR headsets open up gaming, entertainment and productivity in ways that a regular screen just can’t match but the entry price usually makes you hesitate. The Meta Quest 3S 128GB normally sells for $299 on Meta’s official website with nothing extra included.: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/">undercuts that price by $10, dropping it to $289, and throws in an exclusive Cardboard Hero Bundle for Gorilla Tag worth $45</a> that includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor, and 1000 shiny rocks.</p>
<p>You’re essentially <strong>getting $55 in extra value compared to buying directly from Meta</strong>, which explains why Amazon moved over 10,000 units in the past month alone. And you also get a 3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality That Actually Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S brings mixed reality right into your living room and merges digital objects with your real environment. You could place a virtual screen on your actual wall, play a game where aliens climb through your real furniture or set up multiple browser windows floating around your desk while still seeing your keyboard and coffee mug.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor gives the Quest a double boost in graphical performance for smoother-running games with sharper details, and less stuttering during extreme action scenes. The high-definition resolution makes text readable when you’re browsing the web or working in the virtual space, solving one of the biggest complaints about earlier VR headsets where everything looked fuzzy.</p>
<p>The <strong>128GB storage gives you room for dozens of games and apps</strong> without constantly deleting things just to make space. Most VR games run from 2-10GB, so you can have your favorites installed alongside your productivity apps, social platforms, and entertainment content. Wireless freedom means no cables tethering to a PC or gaming console-just put on and jump into what you want to do.</p>



<p>With Touch Plus controllers, you get precision in games and apps while realistic haptic feedback lets you feel textures, impacts, and interactions. Ditch controllers entirely and use hand tracking to swipe through menus, grab virtual objects, or gesture in social spaces. The flexibility of switching between controller precision for gaming and natural hand movements for casual browsing makes the system adapt to whatever you’re doing, not force you into one control scheme.</p>



<p><strong>Home Theater Mode turns any room into your personal cinema</strong> with a massive virtual screen in front of you while it dimmers your surroundings. You can watch movies, sports, or YouTube on a screen that feels bigger than most people’s actual TVs while you lounge on your couch. You can plug in any standard headphones using a USB-C adapter into the 3.5mm headphone jack or plug in USB-C headphones directly for private audio that doesn’t disturb anyone else in the house.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription</strong> includes access to a rotating catalog of games with new additions each month, giving you plenty to explore right out of the box without buying individual titles immediately.</p>
<p>The Amazon-exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle adds immediate value for one of VR’s most popular multiplayer games. Gorilla Tag has millions of players running around virtual playgrounds using arm movements to climb and jump, and the Cardboard Hero gear gives your character a unique look right from the start. The $45 value of this bonus content combined with the $10 price reduction makes Amazon’s deal mathematically better than buying from Meta directly.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-unloads-the-1800w-ecoflow-power-station-now-priced-below-budget-gas-generators-2000641040</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-unloads-the-1800w-ecoflow-power-station-now-priced-below-budget-gas-generators.1343119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages always seem to happen at the worst time—during a winter storm when you need your heat, in the middle of cooking dinner, or right when you’re on an important video call. The problem is solved with gas generators but includes exhaust fumes, constant noise, and the hassle of storing fuel. Portable power stations give you clean backup power without the headaches, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic just dropped to $399 from $599 on Amazon</a>. This thing pumps out <strong>1800W with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that lasts over a decade</strong>, charges from empty to 80% in 45 minutes, and kicks in automatically in under 10 milliseconds when the grid goes down. You’re basically getting backup power that costs less than a decent budget gas generator but works indoors, runs silently and doesn’t require you to drag out gas cans every time the lights flicker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Power for the Devices You Need</h2>
<p>The 1800W continuous output handles most household essentials. Your refrigerator keeps running during an outage so you don’t lose a freezer full of food; your space heater keeps one room comfortable when the furnace goes down, and you can make coffee with an electric kettle or run a microwave to warm up meals. The 3600W surge capacity covers those brief power spikes when devices first turn on, like when your fridge compressor kicks in or you fire up a power tool. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology even pushes the system up to 2600W for heavier loads and opens possibilities for running larger appliances that might trip smaller power stations.</p>
<p>That 1024Wh capacity translates into very real-world runtime that actually matters: You can run a modern refrigerator for about 12 hours, keep a laptop charged through multiple work sessions, power LED lights for days, or run a CPAP machine through several nights of sleep. Winter camping or RV trips become way more comfortable when you can run an electric blanket, charge multiple devices and still have power left for morning coffee.</p>



<p>X-Stream fast charging fills the battery from 0 to 80% in just 45 minutes, meaning you are not waiting all day for it to be ready. Most portable power stations take four to six hours to reach a full charge, so shaving that time down makes a huge difference when you need backup power in a hurry. The UPS function-all under 10 milliseconds-switches automatically to battery power the instant it detects an outage to protect computers, routers, medical equipment, or anything else that can’t handle sudden power loss.</p>



<p>The battery chemistry LiFePO4 lasts more than 10 years with daily use, which is in another league compared to the cheaper lithium batteries that degrade after a couple of years. EcoFlow uses the same EV-grade battery design utilized in electric cars, and a smart Battery Management System prevents overcharging, overheating, and other issues that prematurely kill batteries. You invest in something that works reliably year after year instead of replacing it every few seasons. The system remains safe at extreme temperatures, handles the stress of frequent charging cycles, and maintains consistent power output even while aging.</p>
<p>At $399, you’re getting emergency backup power, camping comfort, and energy independence for less than most people spend on a basic gas generator that sits in the garage leaking fumes.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has announced that its brand new console, the Switch 2, has now sold over 10 million units in the first four months on sale. That makes it the most successful console launch ever by quite some margin. And the two flagship games,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, each have their own extraordinary figures to boast of.</p> <p>The Switch 2, launched June 5 after a peculiar and obfuscated build-up, went on to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">sell an extraordinary 3.5 million units</a> in just its first four days on sale. Now, obviously that number includes <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-walmart-target-best-buy-nintendo-1851777604">pre-orders that built up rather chaotically from April</a>, on top of post-launch sales in the opening days, so it was always going to be the most dramatic number. At the start of August, Nintendo revealed things were still going extremely well, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">a total of six million Switch 2s sold in its first month</a>. While numbers from rival console manufacturers are often more hazy, this fully confirms the hybrid gaming device as the most successful console launch ever, dwarfing the already impressive numbers of the original Switch, and beating the PS5 to 10 million sales by a full four months. Which is to say, the Switch 2 has sold twice as fast as Sony’s behemoth.</p>

 <p>Come <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf">the latest financial filings from Nintendo</a>, noting sales up to the end of September, the company reports that by September 30 it had sold a total of 10.36 million Switch 2s. Which is astonishing.</p> <p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> has nearly doubled its sales since its first month, with a total of 9.57 million copies sold (and that’s actually <em>sold</em>, rather than just shipped), while July 17’s <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has shifted 3.49 million carts.</p>

 <p>All these massive numbers have given Nintendo cause to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_2e.pdf">increase its sales expectations for the end of the financial year</a>. It was originally banking on 15 million Switch 2s sold by the spring, but that hope has now been raised to 19 million. Even this may still be a cautious under-estimation, given we’re just now entering the holiday season—a time period most rival consoles deliberately launch directly into. On top of that, the Switch 2 has already sold for two more months after these reported numbers, and with <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stock-holiday-price-tariff-2000636565">Nintendo’s plan to flood the stores with stock for Christmas</a>, “only” another 8.5 million units by March 2026 could easily be reached.</p> <p>Nintendo also announced that it has sold 1.89 million more original Switches in the same time period, and made a mind-blowing 61.56 million software sales across those six months. The Switch 2, with its far smaller user-base, still sold 20.62 million games, although as you will note, three fifths of that is made up of two games!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-this-20000mah-87w-3-port-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies-2000641031</link>

              <p>You know that sinking feeling when your phone hits 10% battery and you’re nowhere near an outlet? Or when you’re at the airport and every charging station is packed with people camping around power strips? A good power bank solves that problem but most of them either charge too slowly, run out of juice after one phone charge, or force you to carry a bunch of cables.</p>
<p>Anker just dropped the price on their <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5324/">20,000mAh power bank with a built-in USB-C cable down to $44 from the usual $69 on Amazon</a>. This thing <strong>pushes 87W across three devices at once</strong> and can charge a MacBook Pro to 50% in under 40 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5324/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Day</h2>
<p>That 20,000mAh capacity gives you <strong>multiple full charges for your phone</strong> or enough juice to top up a laptop when you’re working remotely and can’t find a seat near an outlet. In real terms, that’s four charges for an iPhone 17 or enough to fully charge your MacBook Air and still have juice for your phone and earbuds. The <strong>battery pack itself recharges in just 1.5 hours</strong> when you plug it into a 65W charger which means you’re not waiting around all night for it to be ready the next morning.</p>



<p>That all changes with <strong>its built-in USB-C cable</strong>: You won’t be rummaging around in your bag for the correct cable or realize it was still lying on your desk at home. Simply pull out the power bank, unwind the cable and plug in your device-done. It charges an iPhone 17 Pro to 58% in 30 minutes, or a MacBook Air to 52% over the same time, which is fast enough to get you through the rest of your workday or a particularly long flight.</p>



<p>The <strong>87W total output splits across three ports&nbsp;with a single device maxing out at 65W</strong>. That means you can fast-charge your laptop through the USB-C port while your phone and wireless earbuds charge from the other two ports at the same time. The setup works for anything: iPhones, Samsung phones, iPads, Nintendo Switch, or any USB-C device you’re carrying around.</p>
<p>Anker designed <strong>this power bank to meet airline regulations</strong> so you can toss it in your carry-on without any drama at security. The 20,000mAh capacity sits right at the limit most airlines allow and gives you maximum power without crossing into the restricted zone.</p>
<p>For $44, you’re getting a power bank that actually covers the situations where you really do need backup power: long travel days, outdoor events, working from coffee shops, or just the peace of mind that your devices won’t die when you need them most. The<strong> 18-month warranty supports it</strong>&nbsp;so if anything goes wrong, you are covered.</p>

              <p>The release calendar is finally dying down a bit, but only just barely. November means it’s officially <em>Call of Duty</em> season, but there are tons of games coming out this month that aren’t called <em>Black Ops 7</em>. Switch 2 exclusives (<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>), neat indie RPGs (<em>Demonschool</em>), and overdue PS5 ports (<em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>) abound. Here are 46 games releasing this month, complete with descriptions and trailers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops with serious power usually carry a price tag equal to a small fortune. You know how it goes: you look at the specs you actually need, check the price, and immediately start compromising. Maybe you don’t really need that much storage, right? Well, HP just threw an early Black Friday sale on Amazon that changes the game completely. This <strong>17.3-inch laptop comes with 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor</strong>-basically the kind of setup that normally runs close to $4,000. The good new is that right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5323/">it’s sitting at $1,199 after a 70% discount</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>17.3-inch touchscreen gives you breathing room</strong> that smaller laptops just can’t match: If you have ever tried to work on a 13-inch screen and felt you were playing Tetris with your windows, you will appreciate the reason size matters in this respect. The HD+ anti-glare panel means you can set up near a window without spending half your day adjusting the angle of the screen so that you can actually see what you’re doing. The touchscreen aspect really does speed things up when scrolling through long documents or just generally navigating about<strong> Windows 11 Pro</strong>.</p>
<h2>Specs That Matter in Real Life</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 5 7430U processor <strong>runs 6 cores and 12 threads and hits speeds up to 4.3GHz</strong> when you need it. In plain English, this means you can video call your team while updating a presentation with Slack pinging in the background and your music playing without your laptop freezing up or fans screaming like a jet engine. The integrated Radeon Graphics handle streaming and everyday visual tasks without breaking a sweat. It’s not a gaming rig, but it covers everything most people actually do on their computers day in and day out.</p>



<p>But here’s where it gets interesting: 64GB of RAM is absurd for most laptops and that is precisely why it’s so great. Most computers ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you into this constant dance of closing programs to free up memory. With 64GB, you just stop thinking about it: Keep your email open all week, run that resource-hungry video editing software, open 50 browser tabs for your research project and the laptop just handles it.</p>
<p>The 4TB SSD storage means you are done with that “delete old files to install new programs” routine. Your whole photo collection from the last decade, work projects, personal files, software and backups can all live on one drive. And SSDs load everything faster than old hard drives so your programs open in seconds instead of you watching that spinning wheel for what feels like forever.</p>



<p>In Windows 11 Pro, there is Microsoft Copilot, the AI tool that helps draft emails, summarize long documents, or even brainstorm ideas when you’re stuck. Built-in AI image features let you edit photos without downloading extra software. Windows Hello logs you in via facial recognition which means no more typing passwords every time you open your laptop.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for this configuration, you’re getting a laptop that doesn’t force you to choose between the features you want versus the ones you can afford.</p>
