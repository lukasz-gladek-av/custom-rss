            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em> a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce835lry896o">you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough</a> that it’s not changing its logo after all.</p> <h2>Capcom leaker claims the publisher has been trying and failing to remake <em>Dino Crisis</em></h2> <p>Fans have been begging Capcom for a new <em>Dino Crisis</em> for many, <em>many</em> years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/swikajakiin.bsky.social/post/3lxhsf5m5ss2x">a game with dinosaurs</a>, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of <em>Dino Crisis</em> isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1960763450801709199">The leaker claims</a> that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the<em> Dead Rising</em> sequels, was working on a remake of <em>Dino Crisis</em> before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more <em>Dino Crisis. </em>Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got <em>Resident Evil</em> back on track with RE7, the publisher can get <em>Dino Crisis</em> going again.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>‘s Xbox port is very different than the PS5 version</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Black Myth: Wukong Xbox Series X|S - DF Review - A Bizarre Port vs PlayStation 5" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-10490qd8s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s something odd: <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, <em>Wukong</em> on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes.</p> <p>This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>

 <h2>Crystal Dynamics announces another round of layoffs</h2> <p>On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game for Amazon, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">announced another round of layoffs.</a> The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of <em>Tomb Raider</em>” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March.</p> <p>“Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted.</p>

 <h2><strong>Epic boss says devs need more Unreal Engine 5 education to avoid optimization issues</strong></h2> <p>There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/tim-sweeney-on-unreal-engine-5-optimization-issues-the-main-cause-is-order-of-development/">at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea</a>. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC.</p> <p>“Many studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin early—before full content build-out. We’re doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so ‘optimize early’ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Laid-off <em>Black Panther</em> game devs join Wizards of the Coast</strong></h2> <p>Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">in an interview with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s <em>Black Panther</em> game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes<em> Shadow of Mordor</em> and <em>Rome: Total War.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can’t tell you yet.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-creator-still-not-sure-when-his-next-game-is-coming-out-2000620743"><em>Bioshock’s</em> creator still doesn’t have a release date for <em>Judas</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-out-now-on-iphone-for-70-or-3-a-level-2000620693"><em>Hitman</em> is out now on phones, but it will cost you $70</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-patch-cassidy-wrecking-ball-bug-2000620763"><em>Overwatch 2′</em>s latest update broke its famous cowboy character</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&amp;M lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Many Unique M&amp;M's Characters Exist?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yzYtUue5Y4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-tablet-falls-to-all-time-low-likely-clearing-stock-right-after-pixel-10-series-release-2000620735</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/google-pixel-tablet-falls-to-all-time-low-likely-clearing-stock-right-after-pixel-10-series-release.1283061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve heard of different colored models of the same exact car costing less than others, but Android tablets? That’s a new one on us. Nonetheless, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/">that’s what’s going on right now at Amazon with the Google Pixel Tablet, where you can save $150 on the white — sorry,&nbsp;<em>porcelain</em> — 128GB model</a> as opposed to the black model.</p>
<p>The white Google Pixel Tablet is just $249, 38% less than the exact same tablet in black. Why? No clue — under the hood they are identical: same 128GB capacity, same 11-inch screen size, same 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution, same Google AI capabilities. Same&nbsp;<em>everything</em>, <span>and once you put a cover on it, who could tell the difference even if they did care?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Don’t Overthink It</h2>
<p>There’s no reason to stare this gift horse in the mouth. Pocket the extra $150 and help yourself to one of the better Android tablets on the market. The 1st Gen Pixel Tablet is the best and most seamless way to utilize Google’s vast suite of apps in tablet form, including Gmail, Docs, and Photos — all optimized for the Pixel Tablet’s screen.</p>
<p>Not the least of these Google features that work brilliantly on the Pixel Tablet are Google AI and Gemini. Now when you’re using a tablet for creative endeavors, to craft an email, or to get a summary of your unread Gmail, Gemini can do that for you with amazing speed. Google AI can also search within photos, text, and videos just by circling it on the touchscreen.</p>



<h2>Great for Work and Play</h2>
<p>Another great creative use of the Pixel Tablet is for video calls with Google Meet. The HD video camera automatically follows you so you can stay in the center of the frame without having to sit in one place, and also adjusts the lighting to suit your surroundings. The people on the other end of your call come through bright and clear too on the 11-inch HD screen, which is also ideal for streaming video content via Google TV or Chromecast.</p>
<p>The 1st Gen Google Pixel Tablet is also the perfect device for managing your smart home devices, especially if they’re from the vast Google family. All told, the regular $399 price for the Pixel Tablet is certainly competitive, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3770/">but when Amazon suddenly decides that the white model is worth $150 less than that — just $249 during this limited-time deal</a> — it’s best to just agree with them and smash that Buy Now button before they change their mind.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-expansion-card-ssd-for-xbox-is-now-back-to-black-friday-price-for-labor-day-2000620786</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-expansion-card-ssd-for-xbox-is-now-back-to-black-friday-price-for-labor-day.1283001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What the heck is going on with file sizes? With each passing year, we’ve seen them ballooning larger and larger to some real unreasonable levels. <em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> which released earlier this year comes in at over 120GB. No one will be shocked when <em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>doubles that. And while these game sizes keep going up, the Xbox Series X remains at a measly 1TB. So if you want to play more than just a small handful of titles without constantly deleting and redownloading your games, you’re going to need expansion storage.&nbsp; <strong>Seagate has an external drive specifically made for the Xbox Series X and Series S. </strong>Right now, it’s on sale for 19% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s usually priced at $160, so after the $30 savings, you only need to pay $130 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>You can double your Xbox Series X storage capacity with the help of this Seagate expansion drive, adding another 1TB of useable space</strong>. Now you’re working with two full terabytes, baby. It’s super easy to setup. Unlike the PlayStation 5 expansion cards, this one doesn’t require opening up the casing to get all up inside the inner bits. It’s simple plug and play. Just stick the Seagate drive into the slot on the backend of your Xbox and you’ll be able to start downloading games right to it or moving them from your internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Seagate developed this external drive in partnership with Xbox and Microsoft, officially licensing the Xbox Velocity Architecture. That technology is used in Xbox Series X allows players to utilize Quick Resume, a feature enabling Xbox games to be running simultaneously.</p>
<p>On the Xbox Series X, you can hop between different games on the fly. So if you’re mid-race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, you can pause to go drop in with your pals for a quick Fortnite session. then continue the race when you’re done. You’ll never see a title screen again.</p>



<p>So because this architecture has been licensed from Microsoft, you can take advantage of Quick Resume and all the other benefits of Xbox’s enhanced memory and storage when playing games off of the Seagate expansion card. You’ll find no changes in performance when playing games off the expansion card versus off the Xbox’s internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Seagate expansion drive for Xbox, increasing your storage by 1TB for a discounted rate</a>. It’s down from $160 to just $130.</p>
