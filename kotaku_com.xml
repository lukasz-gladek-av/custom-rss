But he has life goals that supersede fighting CGI aliens. “When I have kids, you will not see me in movies anymore,” he says. “Golf and dad.

That could make 2026 as good a time as any for a swan song. </p><p>Time has also begun showing its effects on the actor, who <em>Spider-Man </em>director Jon Watts says once did a full standing backflip in his audition for the superhero role that changed his life. Holland says he successfully did the same backflip recently, but this time he pulled every muscle in his stomach and “could not laugh because my stomach was so sore” for weeks. That sort of pain is enough to make anyone rethink their career. </p><p>As one of the most important superhero actors of a generation nears the age of 30, it might be a good time to binge your favorite Holland films before there’s no more to go around. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="86" data-playlist="196012,195371,197298" data-current="196012"><div><p>Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21534.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is all based on a report from October 2024 on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Information</em></a></span><em> </em>(a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release.</p><p>The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either.</p><p>Back in October, <em>The Information</em> said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech.</p><p>If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MacRumors</em> points out</a></span>, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely.</p><p>Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame.</p><p>We’ve contacted Apple for a comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just three hours into 2025, I received an email from Google Play Support with the following subject line: Action Required: Your app is not compliant with Google Play Policies (Luck be a Landlord),” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.trampolinetales.com/luck-be-a-landlord-might-be-banned-from-google-play-2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/luck-be-a-landlord-might-be-banned-from-google-play-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced developer TrampolineTales on January 1</a></span>. “Nothing has changed with Luck be a Landlord in the past few months, but for whatever reason, my game ‘contains gambling’ now!”</p><p>The creator wrote that this has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37152133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37152133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been an issue before in various other countries</a></span>, and they’ve been left with no choice at this point but to endorse Google’s faulty logic in order to keep <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> for sale on Android devices. “I genuinely think Luck be a Landlord deserves the equivalent of an E10+ rating across all regions, but at this point I’ve just given up and will deal with whatever inaccurate rating is slapped on the game,” wrote TrampolineTales. </p><p>They continued, “I’ve now filled out the Google Play age rating questionnaire to ‘agree’ that my game ‘contains gambling.’ I’m doing this in an attempt to stop my game from being banned globally on Google Play since every time I’ve tried to appeal these decisions I’ve simply been sent a screenshot of my game and was told ‘this is gambling.’”</p><p><em>Balatro</em>, which is heavily inspired by <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> and replaces the slot machine mechanics with poker-based gameplay, faced similar issues last year. The association with gambling first got it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-nintendo-switch-eshop-removed-gambling-1851301756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-nintendo-switch-eshop-removed-gambling-1851301756">briefly banned from the Nintendo Switch eShop</a></span> and later led to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-speaks-out-as-pegi-doubles-down-on-its-18-rating-blaming-eu-laws-for-the-roguelikes-adults-only-categorization-this-sucks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-speaks-out-as-pegi-doubles-down-on-its-18-rating-blaming-eu-laws-for-the-roguelikes-adults-only-categorization-this-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">erroneous 18+ age rating from PEGI</a></span> in Europe. It’s unclear how much of this reoccurring issue is because people in charge of ratings don’t know how games work, or are so overworked that they don’t actually have time to pay attention to what they’re rating. </p><p>The faulty association with gambling is particularly pernicious considering there are plenty of games on mobile shops that do feature very obvious gambling mechanics, including ones you can spend real money on. <em>EA Sports FC Mobile</em> replicates the card-pack-opening probabilities of its console counterpart, and even <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> lets players spend money to speed up booster pack openings that all rely on chance for whether you get new rare cards or duplicates of the ones you already own. These, as well as many RPGs with gacha-fueled character-collecting mechanics, are all rated E for Everyone. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
