              <p>The next&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman&nbsp;</em>game was announced today at Gamescom One Night Live, and surprisingly, it looks like the <em>Arkham&nbsp;</em>game that we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> is coming in 2026 and includes several references to different iterations of Bruce Wayne’s story. The action combat, open-world exploration through Gotham City, and even the explosive gel Batman uses to blow through obstacles are evocative of the <em>Arkham&nbsp;</em>games, but there are also references to numerous other takes on Batman, including Christopher Nolan’s <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy.</p> <p>Lead developer Jonathan Smith described it on stage as the “definitive, essential Batman story,” one which will cover the character’s life from his origin to becoming the hero of Gotham. Though some references to Nolan’s films, the Tim Burton movies, and even nods to Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em>&nbsp;were readily apparent in the trailer, Smith said <em>Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> will draw not just from movies but sources far and wide including TV shows, comics, and video games. As you go through Batman’s life, you’ll recruit the members of the Bat Family and face villains like the Joker, Penguin, and Bane, the last of whom will be voiced by Matt Berry. Check out the trailer below:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Legacy of the Dark Knight&nbsp;</em>is the first&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman&nbsp;</em>since 2014’s&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham</em>, though there was a&nbsp;<em>Lego DC Villains&nbsp;</em>game in 2018 that featured the Caped Crusader. Since then, the Lego games have jumped around from <em>Star Wars </em>to Marvel and even included, weirdly enough, a <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> game last year. <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761">It was fine</a>! The <em>Lego&nbsp;</em>games are usually fairly straightforward beat-em-up platformers, so <em>Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> does seem pretty robust for the franchise. <em>Arkham </em>fans will probably be glad to see a lot of Rocksteady’s touchstones returning, as it’s been a whole decade since <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-the-kotaku-review-1712988273"><em>Arkham Knight</em></a> launched in 2015. <i>Legacy of the Dark Knight </i>will launch next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>Today during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Xbox, Treyarch, Raven Software, and Activision revealed the first gameplay trailer for the upcoming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> <em>7</em> at Geoff’s yearly video game showcase. And, folks, it’s a trippy, wild mess.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7,</em></a> which launches on November 14 on consoles and PC,&nbsp;is set in 2035 and builds off narrative “threads from <em>Black Ops 2</em> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>,<em>” </em>featuring characters like past baddie Raul Menendez and a new character, main protagonist David Mason, related to the Masons from the past games in the series. The game will be available on Game Pass on day one, as with past <em>CoDs</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the wild-looking trailer for the game’s campaign, which supports four-player co-op.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egA6Pj485eA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p>Here’s <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s official game description straight from Activision’s official site:</p> <blockquote><p>The year is 2035 and the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare. David Mason leads an elite JSOC team on a covert mission to the sprawling Mediterranean city of Avalon. While there, they discover a sophisticated plot that won’t just plunge the world into chaos, it will pull them into their own haunting pasts.</p></blockquote> <p>According to the devs who were brought on stage to talk about the newest<em> Call of Duty</em>, this is a very “twisted” game set in a <span>“world of fear” where </span><span>“nothing is what it seems.” That seems apparent in <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s first trailer, which features all sorts of wild scenery and imagery, including giant swords, people, weird floating roads, and more. Perhaps it will be nice to have some buddies helping you through these linear missions via the game’s co-op mode. But don’t worry, lone wolves are free to play solo.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Here’s a full video released by Activision about <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s co-op features and what sounds like a rogue-like mode that will offer plenty of replayability.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mojN1Xy5mZA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Announced in June, Black Ops 7 will arrive on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on November 14.</p>
