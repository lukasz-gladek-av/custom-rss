            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were plenty of really exciting announcements about </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>during </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264"><span>last week’s Nintendo Direct</span></a><span>, with fans especially thrilled that several Pokémon who probably should’ve gotten Mega Evolutions a decade ago would finally get them in the upcoming RPG. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-greninja-delphox-2000625428"><span>Kalos starters</span></a><span> and the big mouse himself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, are all getting these beefed-up transformations in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after they were each snubbed when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>first introduced the mechanic back in 2013. However, the excitement has quickly been replaced with annoyance, as each of these new forms has both paid and skill-based gates put on them, and the base game isn’t even out yet.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the most straightforward one. Mega Raichu X and Y are part of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s $30 </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. This is a post-game story expansion that will introduce both Raichu Mega forms and involve Hoopa, the dimension-jumping mythical Pokémon, who is apparently opening up new dimensional rifts throughout Lumiose City. Paid DLC for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games isn’t new, as both </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> had them, but they weren’t announced until some time after the games launched.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There has been some misinformation spreading, suggesting that </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is a day-one DLC and that the new story content is ready to go and is being deliberately separated from the main game to squeeze out an extra $30 from fans, but that’s not entirely accurate. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is listed on the </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-70070000030771-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOopuIYK4FTjTcy2lS9oLVoAa_S4T9XoZ_tFt28QTadILnkf_lQnw"><span>eShop</span></a><span> as having the same October 16 release date as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but this is because buying the DLC grants you immediate access to a set of costumes, while the story content, and Mega Raichu X and Y, will be out “by February 28th, 2026.” Nevertheless, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>raises the cost of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s set of new Mega Evolutions to $100 total if you’re buying the game on Nintendo Switch 2, as the game itself is $70.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Paid DLC for a 70$ game that’s not even out yet.. Are you fucking kidding me…</span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> is 20 dollars btw,” a user on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1nf3x6g/mega_dimension_is_paid_dlc_for_pokemon_legends_za/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> wrote in response to the announcement.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I missed when </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was a full game,” another user replied. “Well into the era of scam DLCs they made full games. Even </span><i><span>Legends Arceus</span></i><span> is [a] post-pandemic full game. Sad to see them doing this shit, and this direction has me reconsidering a purchase of </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>.”</span></p>   <p><span>DLC isn’t new, though, so there’s some precedent for Mega Raichu and any others added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimensions </span></i><span>that might be unveiled between now and launch to be gated behind a paywall. The Kalos starter Mega Evolutions, however, are adding a new wrinkle to completing the Pokedex that is gated behind both an additional cost and a gameplay skill check. In order to get Mega Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, you’ll have to rise up the ranks in online battles, and that means you not only have to play online, but you have to win against other players. The first rub of this is that it’s another pay gate, as you’ll have to pay for an online subscription to play against other trainers through the internet. It will require at least a few months of subscribing to get all three, as each is being given out as a seasonal reward, though we don’t know how long each season will last yet. A Nintendo Online membership costs at least $3.99 a month, so you likely won’t be able to get all the Mega Evolutions the game has to offer without also spending at least $12 on a subscription.</span></p>

 <p><span>After you’ve paid to play online, you’ll actually have to defeat other players, meaning that if you’re not a skilled competitive player who is looking to get sweaty in ranked matches, you could very well not get the Mega Stones you’re paying for. This also means you won’t be able to have any of these forms on your team during your first playthrough, which is a real bummer for folks who want to have these guys by their side as they see </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story through.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m actually pissed the Kalos Starters Megas are locked behind Ranked Matches.

If you’re playing the game on the original Switch, that total will be 10 dollars lower as the game itself only costs $60 on older hardware. But wowza, that’s a lot of money to be asking for when the game isn’t even out yet. That’s nearly the price of two full-priced games, which is typically what The Pokémon Company asks for when it puts out each new pair of games each generation. Maybe this is the company’s way of making up for taking a year off from a mainline RPG or DLC in 2024, or perhaps The Pokémon Company has the type of greed they talk about in the Bible. One way or another, completing </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>just got much more expensive after one Nintendo Direct, and that’s not the vibe Game Freak or The Pokémon Company probably wants with the game just a month away from launch on October 16.</span></p>

              <p>The boundary between hobbyist and professional is a tricky one–especially in creative fields. In balancing the demands of work and creative joy, LocalThunk, lone developer of 2024’s smash hit roguelike poker game <i>Balatro</i>, has announced that the anticipated 1.1 update won’t arrive this year.</p> <p>“I am working slowly,” LocalThunk said <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">in a blog post apologizing for the delayed update</a>, “but I like it that way.” The solo dev shared that, upon reflection, he “probably shouldn’t have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all,” stating that he “took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025.” In the post, LocalThunk does as much as possible to assure folks that he ‘s committed to producing more <i>Balatro</i> in the future, but hitting a 2025 deadline for the update interfered with what he thinks is “the best version of ‘work,’” which is an approach that avoids burnout and “makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development five years from now as I am today.” He added, “I don’t want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets.”</p> <p>LocalThunk did not share a timeline for when to expect the update, simply stating, “It’s done when it’s done.”</p>

 <p>That sounds ominous, but don’t fret. In the same post, LocalThunk shares that not only is he still “drawing my silly jokers” in a “notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game,” but that after finally unlocking all achievements in the game, “the <i>Balatro</i> player in me will absolutely not allow me to walk away from developing this game.”</p> <p>Rather than complaining about the delay, some fans of <i>Balatro</i> have <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">shared positive</a> <a href="https://x.com/CRABnightt/status/1966527713344119110">sentiments</a> regarding the wait. “Take your time. <i>Balatro</i> is great 💜” <a href="https://x.com/butterhoops/status/1966507827670720646">reads one reply on X</a>. “The only reason people are as excited as they are for 1.1 is because you had the chance to take your time when working on <i>Balatro</i>,” <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">reads another</a>.</p> <p><i>Balatro</i> was a hit last year, so it’s no surprise that folks are hungry for more. Still, it’s nice to see folks extending some grace, encouraging a dev to take their time to appropriately channel their creative energies into something meaningful and not rushed.</p>

              <p>Often considered to be the rarest <em>Pokémon</em> card of all, the so-called Pikachu Illustrator (it’s proper name is “Pokémon Illustrator” but no one calls it that) was a print of around 41 cards given to winners of a Japanese competition in 1998. It has since gone on to become notorious, not just for being so highly valued and sought after, but for being the card <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">on which one Logan Paul spent $5,300,000 in 2022</a>. Another of the cards, this one graded as a PSA 9, has just <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416">sold for a flat $4,000,000 on eBay</a>, reaffirming it as the most valuable <em>Pokémon</em> card of all.</p> <p>In 1998, when the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was in its infancy, the prize of a unique Pikachu card for the CoroCoro Comic Illustration Contest must have been nice enough, but not all&nbsp;<em>that</em> special. It’s not known exactly how many were handed out, but it’s believed 41 were printed, made unique by having the word “ILLUSTRATOR” where “TRAINER” would usually appear. The holographic image shows Pikachu clutching an enormous paintbrush, while the Japanese text underneath congratulates the recipients as having been “recognized as excellent in the Pokémon Card Game Illustration Contest.” It’s not known how many survive, but of those that do, the condition they’re in becomes everything. The card Logan Paul bought for $5,275,000 was graded as a PSA 10, meaning it is in absolutely perfect condition. Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">a PSA 7 version in 2023 put up for bids starting at $480,000</a> received not a single offer and went unsold.</p> <p>On Friday September 12, however, another colossal sale price got added to the roster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-sells-for-4-million-on-ebay-3250904/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>.) A PSA 9 version of the Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416?_skw=pikachu+illustrator+psa+9&amp;itmmeta=01K52B559AYKACEQJRAQ7FYPBQ&amp;hash=item548061bf10:g:ZMkAAOSw2gBftsUY&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cD8%2B4RNIGPjfQu10cI3i7MiADIleeZmkMYbcHoGskKVW1uFRrdDQysRGobsccSxuxXNvblhU%2FDuNa8rtRuryQ4jRrEqmuDdthKCzWAkeGrOHT15w6WQt0QPM0uUbamjZPwSrbdviamyB6ZO3%2BEbbja5BqX80KH0oj4pd%2Fx8deTTy%2BeUD96JJSDtNmqyAEbZLX4p68cWqQwaFo98rDfp%2BlTV7vJOAIRPgSvcbxGaGuWwPR9WHUFXjtiqjIPLTu%2FxucxvKlojILs3rcAnLeH4Jb1%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_jUlMuoZg">went up for auction on eBay from seller Scott “smpratte” Pratte, and sold for a cool $4,000,000</a>. This specific card, described as “the Holy Grail of Pokémon,” was for a long time thought to be the only PSA 9 to exist, submitted by Pratte himself after he added it to his collection in 2011. <a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/9249/collector-profile-scott-pratte-profiling-premier-pokemon-trading-card-prognosticator">According to PSA</a>, in 2017 there were four examples graded 9, and at some point Pratte had owned all four of them. In 2013 he sold another PSA 9 version of the Pikachu, listing it for $100,000, but eventually accepting an offer for $50,000. That’s 1.25 percent of what he got for another Pikachu Illustrator with the game grading this weekend. <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-trainer-promo-hologram-trading-card-1998-psa-9-mint/a/7141-91305.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">He sold another in 2016 for just $55,000</a>, which at the time was considered to be&nbsp;<em>extraordinarily</em> high.</p>

 <p><em>Pokémon </em>card prices started to grow in 2020, as the covid lockdowns seemed to drive people to their lofts to find old binders, with classic cards becoming incredibly desirable. This peaked in 2022 when Logan Paul bought the PSA 10 Illustrator as a stunt, and then wore it around his neck on a chain during one of his fake-ass boxing fights. That remains the most expensive card ever, but this weekend’s sale suggests the impact of that price is lasting. Not least considering a PSA 9 Pikachu Illustrator <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7287-36167.s?type=DA-DMC-PriceCharting">sold the same year for $840,000</a>.</p> <p>It’s not clear why Pratte has chosen to part with it now, although I can think of four million really good reasons. It’s really hard to imagine this value sustaining, so there’s a decent chance it’s been sold at its peak. It’s notable that <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-unnumbered-promo-corocoro-comics-psa-trading-card-game-mint-9-the-pokemon-company-1998-/a/7442-36073.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515">someone else sold an identical card just last month for only $625,000</a>, the only difference being that Pratte’s was the first to be graded at 9. You’d imagine whoever sold it must be <em>furious&nbsp;</em>right now, but I can’t help but notice the listing uses the same “Holy Grail!” language as Pratte’s eBay listing. Look, eventually <em>someone’s</em> going to notice that it’s a piece of cardboard. Also, PSA now lists 15 of the card graded PSA 9, 12 as PSA 8, and 7 as PSA 7.</p>

              <p>You can make streaming all your favorite movies and shows a seamless experience with the help of a Fire TV. Specifically, the Fire TV Cube which is the most feature-packed streaming device in Amazon’s lineup. Right now, Amazon, has it marked down by a solid 29%. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Normally, you’d find the Fire TV Cube going for $140, but after the discount, it comes down to just $100</a>. That’ll save you a whole $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Streaming Experience</h2>
<p>Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What’s better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It’s sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick’s Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you’re asking. But what if you’re all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way <em>over there</em>? Now you see the value.</p>
<p>The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max—the premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.</p>



<p>With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that’s what it’s called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.</p>
<p>You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you’re ready to try again against Sister Splinter in&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.&nbsp;</em>Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of<em> Bob’s Burgers</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon’s Fire TV Cube. You’ll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>
