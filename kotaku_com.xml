A fumbled launch can paint a system as the “loser” of a generation, while a strong one can write its name in the stars. Sometimes you don’t even need an incredible launch line-up; you just need one standout game that gets people to show up in droves to buy your box. Nintendo’s launches have run a wider gamut than those of any other contemporary console maker, from underwhelming to spectacular. Some of its launches have set the stage for those consoles to go on and revolutionize the industry, while others are widely regarded as some of the weakest console launches in the history of video games. With the Switch 2 out this month, we decided to look back at all of Nintendo’s console releases and see what were the company’s best and worst launches. Where does the latest system land on the list? Read on to find out.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-recommend-id="image://2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-format="jpg" data-width="1540" data-height="1001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-recommend-id="image://2c8cc2b120ef197e68937245093fe249" data-format="jpg" data-width="1540" data-height="1001" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii U system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Few console launches have become cautionary tales the way the Wii U’s has. Fresh off the incomprehensibly successful Wii, Nintendo had quite the act to follow in 2012. However, the system itself didn’t have much to offer at the outset that you couldn’t find on consoles you probably already had. <em>New Super Mario Bros. U </em>and <em>Nintendo Land </em>were decent exclusives, but the majority of the launch line-up was third-party games that had been out for months or years on the PS3 and 360. The system also launched at the worst possible time. The PS4 and Xbox One were looming, the Wii U was only about as powerful as systems people had been playing since 2005, and unlike the Wii or the Switch, the system’s gimmick was hardly a system-seller. The gamepad was a novel way to try and bring the “second screen” experience to home consoles after the surge of tablets and other mobile devices in the early 2010s, but it didn’t have the immediate appeal of the systems that came before and after.</p><p>I remember when my brother was picking up our Wii U on launch night, and the Walmart cashier (bless her heart) said it was a touchscreen accessory for the original Wii, rather than a new console. There’s nothing quite as damning as the person selling your product not knowing what it is, and that came down to a branding problem above all else. Perhaps that’s why Nintendo went with the numerical naming convention for the Switch 2, rather than something that could have seen it misconstrued as a peripheral. The Wii U never really gained any momentum after it stumbled onto store shelves, even with some excellent games. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-recommend-id="image://raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3760" data-height="2110" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-recommend-id="image://raqxgkid9g5jlh1xf6t0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3760" data-height="2110" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A purple GameCube." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of Nintendo’s consoles had sparse launch line-ups but were carried by heavy hitters. While <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee </em>loomed just a few weeks post-launch, the GameCube’s actual day-and-date catalog was a bit underwhelming. The lunchbox-shaped console was novel with its quirky design and ugly-as-sin controllers that many people still swear by 24 years later, but its first wave of games was pretty weak. <em>Luigi’s Mansion </em>led the pack alongside <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> and <em>Wave Race: Blue Storm</em>, but most of the history books will remember <em>Melee</em>’s fashionably late arrival as the moment the console’s “real” killer app arrived. Sure, I could count it as one of the most culturally significant games in Nintendo history (even if the company doesn’t want you to view it as such), but to keep things clear and manageable here, I’m only considering actual launch games, not games released throughout a console’s ambiguous “launch window.” The GameCube had some real bona fide classics by the time the Wii launched in 2006, but that first month wasn’t so promising. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-recommend-id="image://85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-recommend-id="image://85702e478d2587f7df2dfa96ffcbbd44" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 in its dock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re still kind of in the Switch 2’s launch period, given Nintendo’s second console/handheld hybrid is just about two weeks old, but despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">record-breaking sales</a></span> right out of the gate, the Switch 2’s arrival has hardly felt like a red carpet affair. Part of this is because Nintendo has managed to provide a solid supply for the demand, meaning it feels like a nice thing to have, rather than a hot commodity people are still scrambling for, and I’m not complaining about that. Another is that the Switch 2 is just…the original Switch, but bigger and better. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">That’s also a good thing</a></span>, to be clear, but it’s not quite as electrifying as the original Switch, with all of its novelty, felt in 2017. All that being said, the launch line-up is rock solid and showcases the device’s power. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the headliner and is one of the finest kart-racing experiences Nintendo has put to cartridge, and impressive third-party ports like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>show the system has legs. It’s been a bit underwhelming, but it’s also a smooth, pain-free console launch at a time when most things are bad, actually. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-recommend-id="image://3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1391" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-recommend-id="image://3fb7c0525b151a7013ef73482e38dc1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1391" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Entertainment System." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The years between the collapse of the market for Atari video games in the early 1980s and the arrival of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986 were long and harrowing for me, as a child whose earliest memories saw me developing a love for video games only for them to largely evaporate from the marketplace, their future uncertain. When they returned, it wasn’t with all the hype and fanfare we associate with console launches today. It was, for a bit, tentative and awkward, a case of the culture feeling out this new contender in the space. Nintendo, despite being the makers of beloved games like <em>Donkey Kong </em>and <em>Mario Bros</em>., both of which I’d played in arcades and on Atari 2600, wasn’t a name Americans were familiar with (my mom, god bless her, always pronounced it “Intendo”), and the initial arrival of the NES leaned heavily on R.O.B., a robot who looked cool and futuristic in advertisements but was somewhat frustrating to actually use. (In retrospect, however, I’ve come to appreciate R.O.B. as a wonderful novelty who may have been essential to securing Nintendo a foothold in the American market, letting the NES take up shelf space as a “toy” at a time when “game consoles” felt like poison to retailers.)</p><p>The moment I knew I wanted one—and first believed that video games were about to be back in a big way—was when I saw a big display kiosk touting the console at the Sears department store (RIP) in the Northridge Fashion Center. All the games looked colorful and amazing, leaps and bounds beyond what Atari had been able to deliver, but the one that looked like pure magic was <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. I’d already seen it in an arcade cabinet at my local 7-Eleven, this extraordinary game in which the little mustachioed hero of <em>Donkey Kong </em>now ran to the right into a whole world of mystery and adventure, and here was the promise of that same incredible experience at home. Before too long, Nintendo went from being largely unknown in the States to being a household name (even if my mom never learned to pronounce it correctly), and soon we were all reading issues of <em>Nintendo Power</em> and getting hyped for upcoming releases. It may not have been the most knock-your-socks-off launch in Nintendo’s history, but I think it was probably their most tactical, and it may always be their most historically significant. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-recommend-id="image://82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1329" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-recommend-id="image://82b97ec20037b22be2f6cbabb4f5d930" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1329" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A SNES." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By the time the SNES rolled around, Nintendo had millions of loyal young American fans, and it could do a proper build-up and launch in the States for the first time. Our hype was fueled by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xYhGL5y4DPQ?si=0Ms8Rj9-bDZ-FRz-&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xYhGL5y4DPQ?si=0Ms8Rj9-bDZ-FRz-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that commercial starring Paul Rudd</a></span>—we didn’t know he was Paul Rudd at the time, of course, but he looked awesome playing and enjoying those games, and we, too, wanted a taste of this “Super Power” the new console promised. For many parents, meanwhile, the SNES seemed like a scam, an effort to extort even more money from their Nintendo-addled kids. (For an incredible, time-capsule glimpse of what the period surrounding the SNES launch was like as many parents lamented the hold that video games had developed over their children, you simply must watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/MTzyz2TgGls?si=HRouMNxLHZNasr_Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/MTzyz2TgGls?si=HRouMNxLHZNasr_Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video of a local news report</a></span> from 1991.)</p><p>But for those of us who were firmly in Nintendo’s grasp, the arrival of the SNES was cause for excitement, not concern. Today, game console launches often feel incremental; the PS5 felt like an important technological step up from the PS4, for instance, but not an awe-inspiring one. In the SNES era, however, new hardware could still inspire genuine awe. Oh my god, look at that 3D effect on those tracks in <em>F-Zero</em>! Look at all that color in <em>Super Mario World</em>! Sega’s Genesis had arrived two years prior, stepping up the technology that powered the games we played. Here, with the release of the SNES, Nintendo was firing its own salvo in the 16-bit wars, and once again, Mario was leading the way. The launch bundle included <em>Super Mario World</em>, maybe the best console pack-in of all time, giving players hours and hours of wonderful SNES gameplay right out of the box in a game that remains an enduring classic to this day. Now <em>that’s </em>how you make people feel good about their new console purchase, and eager to seek out the many wonderful new experiences that will be arriving for it in the months to come. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-recommend-id="image://b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-recommend-id="image://b9495142c3062ff0c49f5859e48b7ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange Nintendo 64." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Nintendo 64 is one of the best examples of a launch immediately giving new players all they’ll really need by offering an incredible, generation-defining game right out the gate. Most consoles can’t claim to have the kind of system seller that <em>Super Mario 64 </em>was back in 1996. It didn’t matter that the Nintendo 64’s controller is the kind of sin that god will judge humanity for when we reach the pearly gates; Mario’s first leap into 3D felt like a true generational leap of the kind that’s become increasingly rare in recent decades. One game made such a succinct case for the console that some reasonably argue the N64 never surpassed it. In reality, as they arrived in the years that followed, games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>GoldenEye </em>similarly demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the N64, but most companies don’t have this kind of paradigm shift on store shelves the same day their new console lands. Nintendo had done it twice before, though, with the NES having <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>right out of the gate and the SNES launching with the one-two punch of <em>Super Mario World </em>and <em>F-Zero</em>. And the company would go on to pull off this feat at least twice more, too… — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-recommend-id="image://12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1486" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-recommend-id="image://12188e0f855d638fccfaaf22fe90e327" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1486" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch with blue and red joy-cons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the Switch was unveiled, it sounded like some fanfiction futuristic device you’d made up as a kid. You’d whine to your friends that you wished you could play your Nintendo 64 games on long drives to grandma’s house, and then you’d draw up some impractical machinery that would allow you to pull your games off the TV and onto a handheld contraption. It seemed like science fiction growing up, and then Nintendo released a system that did just that. It wasn’t as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but the portability gave it some actual utility that separated it from the competition and prevented it from falling into the same awkward catch-up phase the Wii U had. On top of it being such an incredible new device, it launched alongside <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, which, in addition to being a fulcrum point for open-world design as we know it, showed that the Switch also had the juice to host console-quality experiences on the go. It’s a double-edged sword that the Switch has become such an important pillar of the console market that Nintendo can’t really pivot away from it to make something new and experimental with the Switch 2, but the company pulled off something that felt like magic in 2017. As soon as it hit store shelves and people got a taste of a brand-new <em>Zelda </em>game in the palm of their hands, it was over. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-recommend-id="image://2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-format="jpg" data-width="851" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-recommend-id="image://2b7a94004605749d15110f6166e52f23" data-format="jpg" data-width="851" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A white Wii with a Wii-mote leaning on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All that being said, I don’t think we’ll ever have a launch quite like the Wii’s again. One of the smartest business decisions anyone at Nintendo ever made was to package <em>Wii Sports</em> with every Wii. One of the biggest hurdles video games must overcome is teaching someone how to play. The more complicated a game is, the more likely you are to lose someone in all the minutiae. Some of the best marketing Nintendo ever did was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p7uJp25BlE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Wii Would Like To Play”</a></span> commercials that showed Nintendo employees bringing the system and its motion-controlled remotes into different families’ homes and showing them playing <em>Wii Sports</em>. As moms, dads, kids, and grandparents all swing the Wii-motes around and their movements are reflected on screen, everyone instantly understands what the system is about. Somehow, this pack-in collection of motion-controlled, sports-based games was a bigger system-seller than the new <em>Zelda </em>that launched alongside the console, and the possibilities seemed so endless. Eventually, the Wii became a dumping ground for shovelware, and Nintendo’s decision to stick with the device’s name for brand recognition with the Wii U ended up biting it in the ass. Still, unless Nintendo or another company comes up with something so intuitive that even your grandmother is hopping on to play, no one is catching lightning in a bottle this way ever again. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tifa, Martial Artist runs the same three colors and has her own abilities:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“Martial Artist” gives Tifa +1 to both Power and Life for each opponent you attack this turn (<em>MtG’s </em>Commander format is usually played with more than 2 players).</li><li>If any of your creatures have 7 or higher Power, at the end of combat, they untap and are able to go into combat one more time. This basically gives you two rounds of combat every turn.</li></ul><h2 id="h179286"><a id=""></a> Get Cloud’s power up to 7 </h2><p> In case it wasn’t clear from the above cards description, your main goal for this deck is to get Cloud’s power up to 7. Luckily, to simulate the Materia System in <em>FFVII,</em> Cloud’s Deck is full of equipment to buff him up. Since he starts at a power of you need to get him a total of +3 to get him there. Here are a couple ways to do so:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>”Conqueror’s Flail” gives +1/+1 for each color permanent you have on the field. Since Cloud runs three different colors, you are likely have three different lands which would give him a total of +3/+3</li><li>”Wrecking Ball Arm” makes the creature it’s equipped to automatically have a power and life of 7. As an added bonus, the equipped creature can’t be blocked by creatures with a power of 2 or less, and legendary creatures can equip it for only 2 Mana as opposed to the 7 it requires for normal creatures.</li><li>A sneakier way is to equip “Champion’s Helm” to Zack Fair. When Zack dies, he can give +1/+1 and any equipment to any other creature. Since Champion’s Helm gives +2/+2, Cloud will hit 7. </li><li>Finally, the easiest is just to equip “Hero’s Blade” which gives +3/+2 to the equipped creature. As an added bonus, if a Legendary Creature enters the battlefield, there is no cost to equip it. </li></ul><h2 id="h179287"><a id=""></a>Other helpful tips</h2><p>If you are having trouble drawing the equipment you need (given Commander’s 99 card deck size, use Cloud’s ability that lets you draw for the number of equipped creatures you have. If a piece of equipment won’t get Cloud to 7, equip it anyway just to get some draw power. You can also try to equip “Darksteel Plate” to Tifa. Since Cloud is a Commander, if he is destroyed, you can easily bring him back, though he will have an additional Mana Cost. Tifa is not so lucky, but “Darksteel Plate” makes Tifa “Indestructible” so she can’t be destroyed unless the equipment is first. It ensures that you are always going to be attacking twice, once you get your board set-up.</p><figure id="" data-id="8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-recommend-id="image://8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shoiws Barret wielding a Wrecking Ball arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shoiws Barret wielding a Wrecking Ball arm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-recommend-id="image://8c41a5f7085adee72156410737d4acb8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shoiws Barret wielding a Wrecking Ball arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>may be incredibly different from <em>Final Fantasy VII.</em> But in this instance, your path to victory is pretty much the same as it is in the video game: Apply buffs to your characters to make them hit harder and faster while minimizing the damage you take.

More than 67 million Americans flocked to see it in theaters, only to leave terrified of ever setting foot on a beach again. John Williams’s ominous score, built on low-pitched instruments like basses, cellos, and tubas, combined with Spielberg’s use of POV shots and clever restraint in revealing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-games-starring-sharks-1843611686&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-games-starring-sharks-1843611686">shark</a></span>, helped cement <em>Jaws</em> as one of the scariest movies of all time.</p><p>From that point on, every shark movie would inevitably be measured against <em>Jaws</em>. And though some have come close to being just as horrifying, many fall short. With so few able to live up to the mastery of Steven Spielberg’s craftsmanship, the genre began to swing in the entirely opposite direction: bottom-of-the-barrel absurdity. These movies put sharks in the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable, and the titles speak for themselves: <em>Space Sharks</em>, <em>Ouija Shark</em>, <em>Sharkenstein</em>, and <em>6-Headed Shark Attack</em> are just a few examples. Only the ones that are “so-bad-it’s-good” make it onto this list.</p><p><em>Jaws</em> set in motion the Hollywood myth that sharks are vengeful and evil killers, when in reality, they’re just curious creatures and human attacks are rare. Still, those toothy giants are the last thing you would want to encounter in open water. If you’re eager to dive into the wild world of shark movies in between episodes of <em>Shark Week</em> on TLC this summer, take a look at the list below. These are the best shark movies that aren’t Steven Spielberg’s iconic blockbuster, ranging from serious horror to those that fully embrace the hokey chaos of Sharksploitation.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-recommend-id="image://6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sofie Gheysens/Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-recommend-id="image://6b52aec8b88c8aa065caa2ede3784b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="5760" data-height="3840" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman inspecting a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Under Paris</em> carries an ecological message and emotional gravitas that elevates the convoluted plot and silly concept into something genuinely exciting to watch. A grieving scientist named Sophia (Bérénice Bejo) must rescue Paris from a giant shark lurking in the Seine. Conveniently, Lilith is the very same shark that killed her husband, making their conflict far more personal and emotionally charged than it would be with a random, evil shark. While Sophia tries to hunt Lilith down, there’s a triathlon taking place that the mayor refuses to postpone (sound familiar?). This results in the grisly deaths of countless athletes. The militaristic efforts to destroy Lilith are over-the-top, and <em>Under Paris</em> as a whole requires a lot of mental gymnastics to appreciate. But it’s got a great payoff that reminds us of the unstoppable force of nature. The upsetting fact that Lilith is mutated by a polluted, waste-filled ocean makes you stop and think just as much as the rest of the movie makes you clutch your seat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-recommend-id="image://179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Syfy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-recommend-id="image://179127d8fb46f7dd02daed04899274dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The low-budget production company The Asylum isn’t exactly known for high art. It mostly churns out cheap copycats of previously released blockbusters like <em>Top Gunner</em>, <em>Transmorphers</em>, <em>The Terminators</em>, and <em>Battle Star Wars</em>. The films are a waste of time and money, and it’s hard to say why they even exist, but one of their original movies became an overnight sensation after airing on Syfy in 2013. In <em>Sharknado</em>, Tara Reid is tasked with saving Los Angeles from a tornado that, somehow, is filled with sharks. Part of the film’s charm lies in how fully it embraces being a winking send-up of the Sharksploitation genre. With sharks out of their natural ocean habitat and raining down from the sky, there’s plenty of room for colorful and outlandish deaths, and <em>Sharknado</em> more than delivers. It may be one of the most shallow shark movies out there, but it’s undeniably worth watching, if not only for its cultural impact. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b2466205b8a0aa59a32e7b421889564" data-recommend-id="image://6b2466205b8a0aa59a32e7b421889564" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man standing in front of a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man standing in front of a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Their open jaws were much taller than a full-grown man and their body longer than an entire school bus. When I was a little girl, I had a theory that they still existed near the bottom of the ocean. This is exactly the premise of <em>The Meg</em>, which should give you a clue into the maturity and believability of this movie. You just have to ride the wave of this intentionally campy blockbuster—much like the ass-kicking Jason Statham, who hangs onto the fin of the massive prehistoric creature, flies through the air, and somehow still survives. <em>The Meg</em> fully embraces its ludicrousness, which is fitting because a creature as enormous as a megalodon ever existing is bonkers enough on its own. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-recommend-id="image://9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-recommend-id="image://9d01caab1cccb22faee716ccae9efe4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark crashing in" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <em>Bait</em> is one of the most creative entries in the Sharksploitation genre. It feels like the filmmakers said: “Sharks in the ocean? Yawn. Let’s put them inside a supermarket!” Director Kimble Rendall tosses <em>Jaws</em>, <em>The Impossible</em>, and Stephen King’s <em>The Mist</em> into a blender for the wild premise: after a freak tsunami hits, a group of strangers (plus a cute little dog) are trapped inside a flooded grocery store with a shark. Standing on the shelves can only help them for so long. Their battle against the shark menacingly roaming the aisles is gorier than most other shark films. The use of animatronics in several scenes makes the carnage believable. Even though the concept sounds idiotic, it actually works and leaves you hooked. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dimension Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-recommend-id="image://bf2a705aa78a1e5fdcdbead8a7e7a4c1" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People trapped in cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In <em>47 Meters Down</em>, a diving trip goes awry for two vacationing sisters. Their cage plummets to the ocean floor, leaving them surrounded by sharks and a dwindling oxygen supply. The viewer is choked with fear by the darkness of the watery environment and the claustrophobic framing. There’s also something terrifying about the characters being completely immersed in the shark’s kingdom—seeing life through their eyes and coming face to face with them. The film uses this setup to deliver some biting jump scares. The sequel, <em>47 Meters Down: Uncaged</em> (2019), raises the stakes by submerging a group of girls in an underwater maze of caves and tunnels filled with sharks. Both films are serviceable popcorn thrillers that venture into uncharted depths of shark terror. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f5c767a7f413cdb5ae9e7cf3a4d1b05" data-recommend-id="image://6f5c767a7f413cdb5ae9e7cf3a4d1b05" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shark attacking a man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

It heightens the stereotype that sharks are vindictive and deliberately hunt down their chosen victims by making them genetically engineered to be smarter. The experiment to see if their brain tissue can cure Alzheimer’s backfires in the most brutal way. It’s great, blood-soaked fun to watch the all-star cast—Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgård, Michael Rapaport, and LL Cool J (who also performs the end-credits rap), etc.—either get caught in the feeding frenzy or narrowly escape. Some scenes use slow motion to heighten the drama and make the adventure feel more epic and cinematic. When <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> bares its teeth, it’s less horrifying and more of a high-adrenaline action flick. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-recommend-id="image://7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-recommend-id="image://7fb08c8c8143a7930f41cb16273cce26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looking terrified" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Being stranded in the middle of the deep, shark-infested waters, with no land in sight, has been the terrifying concept of several movies already, so <em>The Shallows</em> tries to do something different. It’s a cruel twist of fate for Nancy (Blake Lively), who ends up stranded on a tiny, isolated rock only 200 yards from the shore. All that’s between her and safety in the shallow waters is a giant shark. She’s so close yet so far. Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed <em>Orphan</em> and <em>House of Wax</em>, has a very lyrical vision that makes even the simplest of his horror movie concepts feel grand and mythic, which really works for this stripped-down survival concept. Blake Lively gives her character some gumption and emotional gravitas that makes us invested in her survival. There are some very creative set pieces involving jellyfish and a buoy, plus some welcome levity from a seagull named Steven Seagull. <em>The Shallows</em> is a solid B-movie that doesn’t pretend to be anything more than it is, but still manages to rise above most brainless shark thrillers. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-recommend-id="image://a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->IFC Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-recommend-id="image://a447f43a3a5ccc746561443f0eb0af81" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man dangling over a shark" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to expand your shark movie repertoire, you’ll have to wade through plenty of ridiculous ones. But every so often, one surfaces that’s genuinely thrilling and adds something new to the genre. <em>Dangerous Animals</em> has a particularly intriguing premise where a serial killer (played by an unhinged Jai Courtney) uses sharks as his weapon. The breathtaking underwater shots show the sharks in all of their menacing, enormous glory, and they simply behave as they naturally would. <em>Dangerous Animals</em> does not demonize them, instead making it clear that the true predator is toxic masculinity. Tucker’s philosophical attachment to the sharks and the shocking mayhem he causes make for a brutal, fast-paced viewing experience that hits you hard like a tidal wave.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-recommend-id="image://b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Image Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-recommend-id="image://b31a69032bd9bb842e0e13939efdca67" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A shark swimming" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is known for being a shark hotspot, but that doesn’t stop five friends from partying there on a yacht, which ends up capsizing. Director Andrew Traucki was already known for another white-knuckle creature feature, <em>Black Water</em>, about a group of people stalked by a relentless saltwater crocodile in a swamp. Instead of clinging to the tops of mangrove trees, the protagonists in <em>The Reef</em> are forced to make a terrible choice: stay on board the sinking ship or swim twelve miles to the nearest island while a great white shark waits in between. The suspense of this decision, as well as who will be taken by the shark and when, is as razor-sharp as the predator’s teeth. Traucki’s use of actual shark footage gives the water scenes a chilling authenticity. The sequel, <em>The Reef: Stalked</em> (2022), follows an entirely different story in which a kayaking trip goes terribly wrong and is just as intense.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-recommend-id="image://7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-recommend-id="image://7abe23a955ab3c29f4d7623573570edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="People looking frightened at sharks" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Filmed on digital video, <em>Open Water</em> makes an American couple’s harrowing experience stranded in the middle of the ocean after a scuba diving trip look like the worst home movie ever made. Based on a true story and using live sharks instead of CGI or mechanical ones, <em>Open Water</em> stands out as one of the most raw shark movies ever made. The sharks patiently circle the couple in the depths below, unlike Hollywood versions where they launch like missiles toward their prey. The film has an intimate, DIY aesthetic that puts you right there next to the couple: waves lap against the camera, natural daylight fades into a dark thunderstorm, and there is no way to see what lurks below. <em>Open Water</em> proves that shark movies do not have to be elaborate and effects-heavy in order to put viewers on the edge of their seat. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
