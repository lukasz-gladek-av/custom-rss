              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>

              <p>Looking to improve your gaming PC? You may need a new graphics card. The latest and greatest may be a little expensive, but you could always do with a sale-priced upgrade so you can save a bit. We found one that’s heavily discounted now, and you can not only get it for a low price, but it should do your computer some good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">You can find the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card on Amazon right now for $318</a>. In comparison to the original retail price of $470, that’s a discount of $152 and represents about a 32% savings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful GPU that can enhance all your gaming goals</h2>
<p>This ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060Ti is a powerful graphics card that includes all the features you’d need to play the newest games at 144Hz, do photo and video editing at high resolution, and still have room left over to run other (usually demanding) applications.</p>
<p>Based on NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, the 8 GB of GDDR7 memory will allow you to maintain high frame rates at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions with less lag. Even at higher resolutions you should be able to achieve frame rates above 60 FPS. You’ll also see lower power consumption when running with this card.</p>
<p>To support the unique demands of small form factor systems, ASUS has engineered this product to fit within most mini ITX and micro ATX enclosures. While this card does occupy two and a half slots, it’s much smaller than most other graphics cards and leaves ample room to install additional hardware inside your enclosure. It does a great job at balancing both airflow and cooling to maintain stable performance during heavy loads, and uses axial-tech fans and carefully located heat sinks to ensure that this card runs quietly and maintains low operating temperatures.</p>



<p>For the gamer, this graphics card provides a significant upgrade over both integrated and older discrete graphics cards. With this card you’ll get faster load times, smoother frame rates, and better management of modern features like ray tracing when you play supported titles. For creators, the increased memory and processing power of this graphics card will help with tasks such as video editing, 3D modeling, and multitasking, especially when your workloads require more than what a typical GPU can provide.</p>
<p>Overall, with its superior performance, compact size, and highly efficient cooling, the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card is an ideal graphics card for upgrading to for many PC builds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">Given the current sale price of $318, this graphics card is an affordable option to consider if you want to increase your PC performance without spending too much money.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, I went out to the theater and saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a>. Even as a big <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I walked out disappointed. But I don’t want to talk about that. Instead, I want to highlight a moment I was forced to watch <em>twice</em> due to some snafu at my local AMC. The moment in question involves some children hooking up a tube to a monkey’s face and farting into the other end. Hey Hollywood, what the fuck?</p> <p>We arrived to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> about 15 minutes before the movie started, and to our surprise, my wife and I noticed the trailers were already playing. Strange! We sat down and I caught a new trailer for Sony’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><em>Zootopia</em></a> knock-off, <em>GOAT</em>, which is a basketball movie about talking animals or something. Approximately one minute and 49 seconds into this trailer, I was surprised to see two young rhino girls using a tube and a gas mask to funnel a fart from one of the animals’ asses to the face of a sleeping monkey man.&nbsp; Here’s the moment in question.</p>

  <p>I looked around the theater, which was basically empty as we’d arrived fairly early, and questioned if I’d actually seen what I thought I’d seen. I mean, sure, animated movies for kids are filled with fart jokes, so it hardly seemed impossible that Sony’s <em>GOAT </em>would feature one. But having cartoon animal kids basically recreate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7c_GK40Dsjg">the fart mask stunt from <em>Jackass 2</em></a>&nbsp;as a silly moment caught me off guard. I shook it off and soon was lost in the opening minutes of <em>Fire and Ash</em>, the&nbsp;<em>GOAT&nbsp;</em>trailer a distant memory. Or so I thought.</p>

 <p>About 10 minutes later, someone seemingly complained that the movie had started early, and so the AMC restarted everything, trailers included. Mildly annoying, but it did make me giggle at all the people who had arrived late specifically to avoid trailers then being forced to watch them anyway. It also meant that I’d have a second chance to catch the fart joke. And yup, to my surprise, <em>GOAT</em> does indeed include a recreation of<em> Jackass 2’s</em> fart mask bit, complete with the victim retching and losing it.</p>

 <p>Folks, I’m not a prude. I love the <em>Jackass</em> movies. And I’m not above laughing at a fart joke or someone getting hit in the groin. But it feels like <em>GOAT </em>and the people involved were desperate to one-up all the other fart jokes in kids’ movies these days and, in the process, created something that feels like it crosses a line that I’m not even sure I can properly put my finger on. At the very least, moving forward, I’d like a warning before any trailers that feature kids recreating gross-out pranks from <em>Jackass</em> movies, okay?</p>

              <p>Need to give your home a visual upgrade? A set of colorful lights is a great way to do exactly this. And here’s the good news: you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg to do it. In fact, we’ve found a way to do it without spending too much to kick off 2026, and we’ve brought that idea here to you in the form of a deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/">Get the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with Dual Cameras at Amazon for only $74.98, which saves you $65.02 (or approximately 46%) when compared to the normal retail price of $140.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A simple setup for enhancing your TV with backlights</h2>
<p>Govee’s Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 with dual cameras gives you a new level of immersion when it comes to how you watch TV. The Envisual utilizes dual cameras to capture the colors of your TV screen in real-time, then sends those color captures to LED backlight effects behind your TV.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to add excitement and energy to the shows, movies, and games you watch on TV with exciting lighting effects that change with the content being displayed on screen, the Envisual T2 does exactly that. The best part is that you don’t have to learn a difficult setup just to attach some lighting to your TV. Nothing should be that complicated, and this setup doesn’t follow that convention.</p>



<p>To that end, installing the Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight T2 is super quick and easy. The installation package comes with the exact LED strip components that go around the back of your TV and also two smaller cameras that you can install on to your TV frame. But despite seeming intimidating, the setup isn’t all that bad, so you’ll be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can control the lighting for your TV, too. The app allows you to adjust the intensity of the lighting, select various color effects that can be used for different viewing experiences, or choose a specific mode depending upon your viewing preferences. There’s a lot you can change here, and you’re really only limited by your creativity. That’s about it, especially if you’re willing to try a lot of different ideas.</p>
<p>We can’t really say it enough. This special backlight setup is a great way to make your TV feel that much more immersive. It’s a great viewing experience for anyone who wants to take their TV sessions to the next level. And when you factor in how much money you can save right now, that makes it an even better idea to go ahead and grab it right now.</p>

              <p>….And we’re back. Sorry about last year. Our previous owners, G/O Media, were <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-adults-in-the-room-1837487584/">a pack of idiots</a> with more money than brains, who decided to stop anyone at <em>Kotaku</em> from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x">writing personal top ten lists</a>. Why? Pretty simple, really: <a href="https://tedium.co/2025/07/03/go-media-jim-spanfeller-gawker-influence/">They had no idea what they were doing and nearly destroyed this place</a>. Anyway, they’re all gone now, and I’m still here. So let’s talk about my 10 favorite games of 2025!</p> <p>This 2025 list was an odd one to put together. I started with over 20 games that I played this year that I liked a lot. But whittling this list down to 10 was shockingly easy. Nothing felt like it had to be on here or screamed “Zack’s Favorite Game!” <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769">It was a year in which I played so many good games</a>, but few that stuck with me in the same way <em>Control</em> did in 2019, or<em> Half-Life: Alyx</em> the following year.</p>

 <p>I won’t waste any more time. You can go scroll to the list now and nod in agreement with some picks and shake your head at others.&nbsp; As usual, this list is in no particular order until the very end, where I’ll drop my personal favorite game of the year! (<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-robocop-alan-wake-2-best-games-2023-1851124842/3">And</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezen-s-top-10-games-of-2022-1849916027">here</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2021-1848267109">are</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2020-1845735344">my past</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2019-1840540510">lists</a>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, wait, one more thing: If you scroll <em>all</em> the way to the end, you’ll find my top 10 games of 2024. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/jim-spanfeller-is-a-herb-rise-fall-blog-post-deadspin.html">Take that, Jimbo</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><em><strong>Battlefield 6</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616054"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616054">EA / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yeah, I wish EA’s big online FPS had some bigger maps. And, yup, there are still some vehicle balancing issues that need fixing. And, okay, sure, Redsec isn’t great, and the best thing I can say about the single-player campaign is that it’s short. But whatever, none of that has stopped me from investing nearly 150 hours into <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> since it launched in October. This is the kind of chaotic but tactical combat that I love in multiplayer games. The kind of online shooter where you can spend all night driving around in tanks and then the next day grab an SMG and clear rooms with your friends. And then a tank blows up the room you were in, and the building collapses, and you scramble outside into a nearby jeep and escape, only to be sniped by a bastard on the other side of the map. It’s <em>Battlefield</em>, baby, and I love it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Routine</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649265">©&nbsp;Lunar Software</figcaption></figure> <p>When I wrapped <a href="https://kotaku.com/routine-alien-isolation-sci-fi-horror-review-creepy-scary-moon-xbox-pc-2000649242"><em>Routine</em>, a creepy photorealistic sci-fi horror game</a>, I liked it a lot, but I wasn’t convinced it would make my game of the year list. But then it did something not many games can do: It stuck with me. It has an incredibly oppressive and scary atmosphere that evolves in some interesting ways over the course of its runtime, before ramping up the horror to 11. And it does all of this while not being filled with cheap jump scares or bathtubs of blood. The fact that it’s all set it in mundane but incredibly realistic spaces, like kitchens and offices, just makes it all the easier to fully lose yourself in the experience. One scare in particular shook me up so bad that I’ll never forget it.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Avowed</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000004852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000004852"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000004852">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I will forever be a sucker for big RPGs that let me wander aimlessly and discover new quests. Bethesda’s RPGs have been doing that for decades. <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em></a> smartly condenses the Bethesda formula while replacing some of that lost bloat with well-written companions and interesting hand-crafted sidequests. The end result is an RPG that lacks the simulation elements of <em>Skyrim</em> and the scale of <em>Fallout 4,</em> but features memorable characters and moments that stood out in a year filled with both.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>THPS 3+4</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001310">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>Few games feel as good as a well-made<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> title. And this year’s remake of <em>THPS 3 </em>and <em>THPS 4</em> is very well-made indeed. This is just a perfect little package of skateboarding shenanigans. Yes, I know people got mad about the open-world quests being removed from <em>THPS 4,</em> but I’ve always preferred the two-minute format for these classic <em>Tony Hawk</em> titles. Leave the big spaces and quests to <em>Underground</em> or <em>Wasteland</em>, y’know? That minor quibble aside, what Iron Galaxy created with <em>THPS 3+4</em> is marvelous. It looks like I remember those old games looking, plays fantastically, and features enough challenges and extra content to keep you grinding and flipping for many late nights. Now, someone convince Activision to remake <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground,</em> please.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>Despelote</strong></em></h2> <figure><figcaption>© Panic</figcaption></figure> <p>I don’t care much for soccer. But I loved <em>Despelote</em>, a game that uses soccer as a throughline connecting different moments from a young boy’s life as he grows up in Quito during Ecuador’s qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This is a story about being a kid, dreaming big, getting into trouble, lying to your parents, growing up, and going back to where you once lived, only to find a much different place. You’ll be able to finish this one in a single extended sitting, and by the end, you’ll likely be won over by its storytelling, voice acting, visuals, and heart.</p> <h2><em><strong>Dispatch</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000647392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000647392"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000647392">© AdHoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of Telltale narrative games (like <em>Wolf Among Us </em>and <em>The Walking Dead</em>) back in the day and enjoyed them, but I wasn’t sure if that formula would work again in 2025. I mean, I’m not sure it really worked back then either, but the writing was strong enough to win most folks over. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, a narrative-driven episodic game about a superhero agency, shows that with some tweaks and upgrades, the Telltale formula can still kick ass. Strong voice acting, a focus on narrative over fluff gameplay, and some truly funny moments help this strange workplace superhero comedy succeed in a way that, I’d argue, most Telltale games didn’t. Now, where’s season 2?</p> <h2><em><strong>Mafia: The Old Country</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655161">© 2K</figcaption></figure> <p>When I sit down to play a game, I don’t always want to invest 400 hours into an RPG or grind away filling up meters or fight random people online. Sometimes, I just want a linear, 10-to-15-hour cinematic experience featuring solid gameplay and gorgeous visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-the-old-country-rare-big-game-you-can-finish-weekend-short-aaa-2k-2000655148"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is that kind of game</a>. The kind of game that we don’t get much of anymore. A big-budget AAA linear action adventure game that lacks crafting, RPG skill trees, or other guff. It’s just the classic mobster story of a dude who goes from nothing to everything, but it all costs him so much. Except this is set in 1904 Italy and ditches Tommy Guns and big cities for rolling fields and horses. The end result is beautiful.</p>

 <h2><em><strong>South of Midnight</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000003790" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003790"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003790">© Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>If <em>South of Midnight’s</em> combat was better, it might have been able to slide into my top spot because everything else around the action-platformer is just that damn good.<em> South of Midnight</em> is a stop-motion-style adventure through a magical version of the South that deals head-on with topics like racism and slavery. But it also celebrates the unique culture that exists in the deep southern portion of the United States. And what screenshots of this game don’t reveal is that it’s packed with some of the best music of 2025, with songs that made me dance and others that made me cry. If you want to feel something, <a href="https://kotaku.com/south-of-midnight-game-pass-xbox-series-pc-south-review-1851775149">play <em>South of Midnight.</em></a></p> <h2><em><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000700"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000700">© Universal</figcaption></figure> <p>One night, while playing<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, I spent nearly three hours creating a massive paddock filled with various dinosaurs and a jeep tour. When I realized I had spent that much time on one part of the map, I felt a bit weird. Then I burned another hour while making that paddock look amazing and ensuring the adult and baby dinos inside were happy and healthy. A great game doesn’t have to tell some epic story or be filled with important themes and ideas. A great game can just take what came before it, expand on all of that, and then offer you a newly perfected prehistoric park builder that will suck away weeks of your life if you aren’t careful. This is one of the best simulation games around, and easily the best<em> Jurassic Park</em> game ever made.</p>

 <h2><strong>And my top game of 2025…<em>The </em></strong><em><strong>Outer Worlds 2</strong></em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639922">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>I went back and forth on this a lot. I bet if you ask me in like two months what my top game of 2025 is, I might say something else. Truly, this was a strange year. But, I must admit that the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> (from <em>Avowed</em> studio Obsidian) was my game of the year.</p> <p>As someone who has put an embarrassing number of hours into<em> Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4</em>, I’m always craving an RPG that can provide similar experiences. The original <em>Outer Worlds</em> got close, but <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> finally nails and then improves on the open-ended FPS RPG action found in those past<em> Fallout</em> games. Gone are the stilted conversations from <em>Fallout</em> and the wonky combat and visuals. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> looks marvelous, feels like a joy to play, and still makes sure to include enough quirky moments and silly bits to satisfy any <em>Fallout</em> fan. Obsidian even included an in-game radio with ads and songs just like Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games.</p> <p>I can’t wait to come back to <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> in a few years, after forgetting most of it, and replay it as a new character. And to me, that’s the ultimate proof that a game has done something right.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-the-27%e2%80%b3-odyssey-gaming-monitor-to-black-friday-pricing-now-as-cheap-as-a-portable-monitor-2000656027</link>
            <guid>1394368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The big gift-giving holidays have come and gone. If you didn’t find the gaming monitor you were hoping for under the tree, then its time to take matters into your own hands. If you’re looking for a reliable display for gaming or general everyday use, the Samsung Odyssey G5 27-inch QHD monitor is an excellent option. Not only does it check all the key boxes for performance and visual quality, but right now, it’s also available at a significant discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6613/">Amazon is offering a 28% price cut, bringing the cost down from its usual price of $250 to just $180, saving you a full $70.</a></p>
<p>The 27-inch size of the Odyssey G5 offers the perfect balance between ample screen space and a size that doesn’t overwhelm your desk. The 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution delivers crisp and clear images. While 4K resolution would offer even more detail, it would also come with a much higher price tag for a barely noticeable difference at this screen size. The monitor also supports HDR, enhancing color vibrancy and ensuring that whites appear bright and clean, while shadows are rich and deep. With a fast 200Hz refresh rate, it provides smooth and fluid motion, and the inclusion of AMD FreeSync technology eliminates screen tearing, helping ensure that your visuals stay seamless.</p>

<h2>Real-Time Reaction Speed</h2>
<p>What truly sets this monitor apart is its ultra-fast 1ms response time, making it incredibly responsive during fast-paced gameplay. This rapid response allows you to react instantly, which is crucial for gaming where split-second decisions can make all the difference. As someone who switched from console gaming to PC, I can personally attest to how much input lag affects gameplay. I didn’t realize just how much of an impact it had until I tried playing <em>Silksong</em> on my old 2017 TV and compared it to playing the same game on my gaming laptop. The difference was night and day. On the TV, the game felt sluggish and nearly unplayable, but on the laptop, combat and platforming were much more manageable.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 is incredibly versatile, offering compatibility with a wide range of devices. Whether you’re connecting a gaming PC, laptop, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or almost any other device, this monitor can handle it. It features two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort connection, giving you plenty of options to set up your ideal gaming or work station.</p>



<p>The stand on this monitor is also fully adjustable, allowing you to modify both the height and tilt. This ensures you can find the perfect viewing angle for maximum comfort, whether you’re working for hours or diving into extended gaming sessions. Your neck and back will definitely thank you after long periods of use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6613/">Even if you’re not a hardcore gamer, this monitor still provides great value, especially with the current 28% discount.</a> Whether you’re using it for gaming, work, or general multimedia, the Samsung Odyssey G5 is an excellent choice at just $180 for a limited time.</p>

              <p>Root through your drawers, and check that cardboard box in the attic: 3DS prices are going through the roof. As spotted by X account <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2005564455271490030">Pirat_Nation</a>, the old Nintendo handheld is now selling secondhand for as much as or more than they did at launch.</p> <p>The 3DS, originally released in 2010, was officially discontinued in 2020. A successor to the massively successful Nintendo DS, it matched its predecessor’s two-screen clamshell design, but this time with a stereoscopic 3D screen on the top half that didn’t require wearing magic glasses. It was, despite how you might remember things, a <em>phenomenal</em> success, selling a wild 75.94 million units across its ten years and various incarnations. Yet, despite this apparent ubiquity, demand for the devices is currently skyrocketing such that a used 3DS XL—which you could have picked up a year ago for under $100—can right now fetch you upward of $250.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">3DS Prices Are Spiking</p> <p>This Decade-Old Nintendo Handheld Is Now Worth Almost as Much as a Switch 2</p> <p>New 3DS XL models are often selling for $200 to $350 used.</p> <p>Prices are likely to keep climbing. <a href="https://t.co/s0SZJecvzM">pic.twitter.com/s0SZJecvzM</a></p> <p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2005564455271490030?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given the larger 3DS XL cost $200 on release (which itself was $50 cheaper than the original 3DS at launch), this is a massive price. It goes even higher if you’re looking for the so-called New Nintendo 3DS XL, the 2014 version of the handheld that added a new C-Stick and a better CPU, which you’ll struggle to pick up in good condition under $280. (If you scour eBay you might at first declare, “This idiot so-called ‘journalist’ has it all wrong!” until you look a bit closer and notice the lower prices will be for Japanese-only LL models, or listings that eventually reveal details about damaged LCD screens and the like.) It’s not entirely clear what’s driving this new interest; there hasn’t been a significant jump in piracy techniques since custom firmware superseded the need for flashcarts a few years back. Still,&nbsp;the 3DS remains an <em>amazing</em> gaming device.</p>

 <p>While the 3D effect was never something that really worked for me (with imperfect eyesight, it just looked blurry and unconvincing, and I’d inevitably just switch the effect off in every new game), it’s essentially a faster, bigger, and better Nintendo DS (the best console ever made, obviously), and is backwards compatible with the wonderful archive of DS games that preceded it. My 3DS XL sits proudly on the shelves behind me, secure in the knowledge that I’ll never sell it (well, unless prices spike an <em>awful</em> lot more), a copy of <em>Pokémon Ultra Moon</em> in the cart slot as nature intended. But it’s tempting!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> be a PlayStation 7 game? Is <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> really going to be playable on Switch 2 next year? And why is Logan Paul so good at making everything he talks about, including Pokémon cards, sound so sleazy? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Ex-Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Shawn Layden is apparently pitching <a href="https://gamerant.com/shawn-layden-playstation-new-project/">a <em>Mad Men-</em>style show</a> about game development. It will probably never get made but I would definitely watch the hell out of that. Bobby Kotick could play Bobby Kotick, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/h0fo5r/in_moneyball_2011_bobby_kotick_the_ceo_of/">again</a>. For now, <em>Mythic Quest</em> remains a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/105byyf/are_we_apologizing_for_the_nazis_or_on_their/">pretty great parody</a> of the video game industry.</p>

 <h2>Logan Paul sounds desperate to sell his $5.3 million Pikachu</h2>   <p>“Pokemon as an asset class has outperformed the stock market by upwards of 3,000 percent in the last 20 years.” That’s how the online content hustler recently hyped up the upcoming auction for his PSA 10 Illustrator Pikachu card, which he claims is the most valuable Pokémon card in the world, during a segment on Fox Business.</p>

 <p>Prior to promoting the upcoming auction, Paul <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">had been wearing</a> the nearly $6 million piece of paper around his neck during wrestling matches. If anyone can pop the insane bubble around Pokémon cards coming out of the covid-era lockdown, it’s the guy who, just a couple of years ago, had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787">refund fans</a> for his failed NFT game.</p>

 <h2>Could <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> be the next big Switch 2 port we see in 2026?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">Data mining of the recent Title 4 Update</a> hints that development might currently be underway on a Switch 2 version. Considering <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> and <em>Pragmata</em> are also coming to the new console, that’s not completely unexpected; Capcom has been supporting Switch 2 in a big way, though <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ performance struggles on PC and console don’t instill a ton of confidence about how it might fare on the weaker platform.</p>

 <p>It might not be the only big new third-party port we see next year, either. Leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://imgur.com/YnfBIbY">reports</a> that a rumored ongoing shortage around Switch 2 dev kits has “largely been resolved.”</p> <h2>When will we see <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Polish analytics firm Noble Securitie <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">predicts</a> it could arrive as early as 2030 with a budget of roughly $420 million. That seems to wildly overestimate the speed and efficiency of modern AAA development. My own guess is we don’t see it until 2032 and it costs over half a billion before marketing.</p>

 <h2>Zack Snyder is a fan of the Kim Kardashian skin in <em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Justice League</em> director recently wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS1aM6VEd1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=fea529be-5c29-42dd-90ce-d2129577d360">Instagram</a>, “Big thanks to @kimkardashian for carrying me to all those Royales on @fortnite over Christmas break.” The Kardashian cosmetic is <a href="https://kotaku.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-skin-item-shop-most-used-2000655163">reportedly</a> the most popular skin in all of season 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Front Missions 3: Remake</em> is right around the corner and has a free demo</h2> <p>The overhaul of the tactical mech RPG classic for PS1 arrives on January 30 and recently got a free demo for fans to try. Unfortunately, the<em> Front Mission</em> series remakes have been some of the worst around, and I’m not holding my breath that <em>Front Mission 3</em> will reverse the trend. <a href="https://x.com/senhorcorvo/status/2003901159921360908">Early reports</a> from the demo are that the game still rocks but it feels like it was thrown together on a shoestring budget.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-chinese-rpg-sword-fairy-trailer-remake-2000655947">Fans debate<em> Clair Obscur</em> becoming the new “Boss Baby Vibes” meme</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988">In-development footage shows the version of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> we didn’t get</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-5-voice-actor-ned-luke-swatted-police-live-streaming-twitch-2000655992">Cops know <em>GTA 5</em> voice actor by name because he’s been swatted so many times</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>When the U.S. gambling laws <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23561576/chalk-line-how-got-legalized-sports-betting">loosened in 2018</a>, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23561576/chalk-line-how-got-legalized-sports-betting">many and various ways it would destroy people’s lives</a> were widely predicted. It wasn’t hard to guess: you just had to look at every other country where it was allowed, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mp0dp71ryo">not least the UK</a>. But perhaps few would have bet on (sorry) this resulting in a situation seven years later where bots were making small fortunes betting on online video games. One such bot, named TeemuTeemuTeemu, has made $230,000 in just five months gambling via Polymarket on games like <em>Counter-Strike</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bot made $900 -&gt; $208k in 3 months on polymarket</p> <p>one of the most talked about bots on polymarket right now<br>farmed $208,521 pure profit in a quarter</p> <p>focus exclusively on esports<br>mainly LoL and Dota 2</p> <p>bot monitors live game<br>parses stream and official data faster than market… <a href="https://t.co/YTueu8U3Dm">pic.twitter.com/YTueu8U3Dm</a></p> <p>— Archive (@ArchiveExplorer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveExplorer/status/2005688246815146183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As noticed by X user ArchiveExplorer, the bot has made the majority of this money in the last three months, making observations of live games faster than any human could, and getting its bets in before the market can react to events in games. As such, it’s able to get bets in at far lower or higher odds than humans trying to react to in-game kills or objectives, and thus to game the market for maximum profit.</p>

 <p>Scrolling through <a href="https://polymarket.com/@TeemuTeemuTeemu">the bot’s history of bets</a>, it wins far more often than it loses, putting fairly large sums (routinely between $200 and $20,000) on very marginal improvements, bringing in modest wins of a few bucks up to around $1500. But it does this a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>—1,127 times over the months—with its biggest win being $89.3k in one bet.</p>

 <h2>You’ll never guess who let this happen</h2> <p>Of course, using bots to predict markets and make <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12827752">light-speed decisions</a> isn’t anything new when it comes to gambling. That’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low_latency_direct_market_access">how the stock markets have worked</a> for years. Given the recent rise of Polymarket, a crypto-scam-based prediction market where anyone can place bets on pretty much anything, it’s inevitable that it will eventually be entirely dominated by bots and algorithms, racing to be the fastest and most precise.</p>

 <p>Polymarket’s recent success is largely down to the Trump administration’s relaxing of regulations surrounding such an enterprise, driven—you’ll be astonished to learn—by a desire to allow Trump’s farcical Truth Social platform to offer the same sort of prediction gambling. Announced a couple of months ago, Truth Predict is the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group’s attempt, in partnership with Crypto.com, to muscle in on the market. Fun fact: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485594b3-5a72-4ae1-aa93-8ee987be1569">according to the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, Crypto.com donated $11 million to “Trump causes,” shortly followed by the closing of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the company.</p>

 <p>Oh, and guess what! Donald Trump Jr. sits on the board of Polymarket! It so happens that back in July, investigations into whether Polymarket had been acting illegally were dropped by Trump’s government, after the company had previously stopped operating in the U.S. when the Biden administration suggested it might be running “an illegal exchange.”</p>

 <p>Quick aside: any small part of the above would have been enough to end a presidency at any previous point in history. Now, this is just one of many, many schemes, scams, and grifts the current president is running, out in the open, with no consequences at all.</p>

 <p>La la la, everything’s fine, do bee do bee doo, ArchiveExplorer suggests there’s now a lot of competition to build similar and faster bots than TeemuTeemuTeemu, all designed to exploit the ways in which games like&nbsp;<em>Dota</em> and&nbsp;<em>LoL</em> are competitively played. Money isn’t real, capitalism is a grift, and <a href="https://frac.org/hunger-poverty-america">47.4 million Americans live with food insecurity</a>.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="476">If you’ve ever wanted a device that’s easier to handle than a full-sized tablet but still larger and more capable than your phone, the iPad Mini fits perfectly into that sweet spot. It’s designed for people who want portability without giving up power or versatility. Whether you’re a creative professional, a student, or someone who just enjoys relaxing on the couch while scrolling for hours on end, the iPad Mini delivers a balanced experience that works in almost any situation.</p>
<p data-start="478" data-end="806">Right now, the 2024 Apple iPad Mini is even more appealing thanks to a solid discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">The 128GB device is currently available at 20% off, which means you save $100 off the original $499 price</a>.

<h2 data-start="808" data-end="841">Big Power in a Compact Design</h2>
<p data-start="843" data-end="1253">The iPad Mini features an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that packs all the quality you expect from an iPad into a smaller, more comfortable form factor. It’s light enough to hold with one hand, making it ideal for reading, browsing, or sketching on the go. The display itself is sharp, vibrant, and designed with ultra-low reflectivity, so it remains easy to see even in bright lighting or outdoor conditions.</p>
<p data-start="1255" data-end="1689">Under the hood, the iPad Mini is powered by Apple’s A17 Pro chip.

Apps launch quickly, transitions are fluid, and performance stays consistent whether you’re editing photos, watching videos, or bouncing back and forth between multiple apps.</p>

This feature is especially useful for video calls on FaceTime, Zoom, or other conferencing apps, as it automatically keeps you centered in the frame—even if you move around or someone else joins you in view. On the back, the 12MP camera supports 4K video recording and makes scanning documents quick and easy.</p>


<p data-start="2123" data-end="2436">Thanks to the A17 chip, the iPad Mini also offers fast Wi-Fi connectivity and smooth performance for everyday tasks like taking notes, marking up documents, editing photos or videos, and even gaming.

It runs a number of apps such as Microsoft 365 and Adobe Photoshop, as well as graphics-heavy games, without any issues.</p>
