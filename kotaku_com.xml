            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lay’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/college-students-float-on-bags-of-potato-chips-1638992763">potato chips</a> are receiving a big rebrand that makes it clear that the popular snack food is made from potatoes. That might seem silly, until you realize that according to the chip maker, nearly half of the people who buy its product didn’t know the chips were made using potatoes. Seriously.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/our-stories/story/from-potato-to-chip-the-next-chapter-of-lays">Lay’s announced plans to “revamp” the “world’s most popular potato chip”</a> and laid out what it intends to do in a press release that revealed the new chip bag design and shared the surprising statistic.</p>

 <p>“There are more than 4,000 registered potato varieties in the world, and only 10 are good enough to become a Lay’s potato chip,” explained Lay’s in a press release that mentions the word potato nearly 30 times. “Lay’s spends up to nine years creating the best potato for farmers to grow that can deliver the perfect crisp, flavor and golden glow when sliced and cooked. The potatoes’ journey from the soil to the shelf is the heart of Lay’s. But here’s the surprising part — 42% of people who enjoy Lay’s don’t realize they’re made with real, farm-grown potatoes.”</p>

 <p>Usually, I find press releases to be filled with exaggerated language and brand hype that I roll my eyes at, but yeah, no, that is indeed surprising. Nearly half of the people who buy and consume Lay’s chips don’t know they are made from…potatoes? It makes me wonder what they thought the chips were made out of and if they even had a guess or were just buying bags of salty and crispy snacks without much thought beyond “It tastes good.”</p>

 <h2>The new Lay’s chip bag</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000637409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637409">©Lay’s / PepsiCo</figcaption></figure>  <p>So to help address this problem, and also declining sales, the chip maker is rebranding its most famous product. I mean, this doesn’t seem like Lay’s problem to me, but it’s nice they are trying something. You’ll notice that the new bag design has potatoes on it. I mean, the old design <em>literally</em> had a potato transforming into a chip on the front of it, but apparently that wasn’t working. The new bag looks more rustic with wood paneling artwork, and even says, in big black letters, “Made with real potatoes.” Lay’s really wants you all to know that these are potato chips. Lay’s also says it’s removing artificial flavors and colors from its popular potato chip brand in the United States, too. I assume this is connected to U.S. Health Secretary and America’s 14th weirdest maniac, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-to-announce-phasing-out-of-artificial-food-dyes">his ongoing war against artificial flavors and other chemicals he doesn’t like</a>.</p>

 <p>“The new visual identity celebrates the humble, farm-grown potato — where every Lay’s potato chip starts — and heroes the ingredients that deliver the unmatched flavor consumers have always loved,” explained Alexis Porter, PepsiCo’s Vice President of Marketing, Global Lay’s, in a press release. You can almost hear the desperation from Porter when talking about how these chips are made from potatoes.</p> <p>Will all of this work? Who can say? It does feel like more than ever, the world is slipping into accepted stupidity, while folks seem overall less interested in learning. And if you do try to learn anything, you just end up reading AI-generated summaries filled with nonsense. Or maybe people just assume everything they buy in a store is fake and overly processed plastic pretending to be food. Probably a bit of column A and column B. I’m feeling kind of sad about the future. Seems like the perfect time to curl up on my couch and eat some chips. Wonder what these things are made out of?</p>

              <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-free-demos-next-fest-painkiller-reanimal-steam-2000634620">wrapped up today</a> and Valve has revealed the most downloaded demos from the event. Big winners included <em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em>, <em>Everwind</em>, and <em>YAPYAP</em>. If you’ve never heard of any of those, this is your chance to catch up on tomorrow’s hit Steam games before they’re out.</p> <p>Here are the top 10 demo downloads during the latest Steam Next Fest in order of most unique players:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Half Sword</em></strong></a> (medieval swordplay sim)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</em></strong></a> (turn-based strategy)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3834090/YAPYAP/"><strong><em>YAPYAP</em></strong></a> (magic comedy crew-like)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4021860?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Final Sentence</em></strong></a> (typing battle royale)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Reanimal</em></strong></a> (co-op horror adventure)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4028270?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Everwind</em></strong></a> (co-op survival RPG)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Midnight Walkers</em></strong></a> (zombie extraction shooter)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810880/THE_CUBE_SAVE_US?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>The Cube, Save Us</em></strong></a> (extraction MMO)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4059420?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Misery</em></strong></a> (post-apocalyptic co-op survival)</li> <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179350/Long_Drive_North_CoOp_RV_Simulator?snr=1_614_615_nextfestmostplayed_100703"><strong><em>Long Drive North: Co-Op RV Simulator</em></strong></a> (open world survival)</li> </ul> <p>Online co-op and survival sims still reign supreme, though it’s nice to see <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em> having a mini-breakout moment in 2025. “This is the heroes game I have been waiting for ever since heroes 3,” wrote one Steam reviewer about the demo. I was never an <em>HoMM</em> guy growing up, but I like strategy RPGs and enjoyed what I tried of the Early Access build that came out earlier this month.</p>

 <p>Here are some other games from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed">larger top 50 Next Fest demo list</a> that caught my eye. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923350/Ultimate_Sheep_Raccoon/"><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em></a> is a multiplayer PVP <em>Trials</em>-like. Think 2D side-scrolling <em>Mario Kart</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/"><em>Master of Command</em></a> is a history buff’s historical strategy game that trades neat graphics for the nitty-gritty detail of regiment customization and supply line management. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170150"><em>Cairn</em></a> is an open-world atmospheric climbing sim. It looks like the indie version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> meets <em>Death Stranding</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4040960/Tears_of_Metal_Demo/"><em>Tears of Metal</em></a> is a co-op hack-and-slash roguelike. It’s giving <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> in the art style of <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>. Finally there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/"><em>Skate Story</em></a>, a skateboard RPG in which you grind through a shadow realm to liberate tortured souls. I keep hearing great things.</p> <p>The October 2025 Steam Next Fest may be over now, but most of these games still have free demos you can download if you want to check them out and wishlist them ahead of their launch windows. Because as we all know, Steam users don’t already have way too much to play.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fear-project-origin-monolith-productions-mordor-2000637400</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The innovative and fondly remembered <i>FEAR</i> turns 20 this year, having been released on October 18, 2005. The game arrived on PC (and later PS3 and Xbox 360) as a thrilling mix of first-person-shooter gunplay and survival horror, incorporating exhilarating bullet-time mechanics and playing with your sense of reality when you least expected it. It remains a hell of a good time, with smart computer-controlled enemies and a mysterious little girl who will haunt your dreams. Its sequel, <i>Project Origin</i>, is a serviceable 360-era shooter with a…disturbing sexual assault scene at the end. As for <i>FEAR 3</i>, well, I’m sure someone likes it.</p> <p>If you haven’t played these games or have been meaning to add them to your library, you can now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/12357/">grab the whole collection on Steam</a> for just over five dollars from now until October 23, 2025, making it a perfect way to jump into these shooter/horror games in time for Halloween.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Warner Bros. Cancels <i>Wonder Woman</i> Game And Shuts Down <i>Shadow Of Morder </i>Studio</a></p> <p>Developed by Monolith (<a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">RIP</a>), <i>FEAR</i> puts you in the role of a “First Encounter Assault Recon” soldier tasked with stopping some out-of-control telepathically controlled soldiers. Along the way, you unravel the mysteries behind some warped experiments involving psychics and cloning.</p>

 <p>The series’ use of bullet time isn’t just about looking cool; it’s a pretty essential tool for overcoming some of the overwhelming forces you’re up against. And while it definitely feels powerful and awesome to use, it isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card, especially on harder difficulties. You need to be mindful of when and how you use it.</p> <p>The original remains an iconic game of the 2000s era, with a sequel that’s well worth your time if the universe speaks to you. Sadly, <i>FEAR 3</i> (stylized as <i>F3AR</i> 🙄) was a victim of the co-op shovelware trend that was particularly insidious during the 360 era. I do recall a handful of decent moments in some of the levels, but it’s a very skippable game if you’ve had your fill by the end of <i>FEAR 2</i>’s DLC. Normally I wouldn’t advise anyone to buy it, but seeing as the whole series including the DLC is on sale on Steam as a package deal for a little over five bucks, I’d say it’s worth having this one in your collection to get the other, better ones. Say hi to Alma for me.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of my favorite games ever are on sale for the Switch right now. You might already own most of these, but I promise most of you will find something worth picking up in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/">eShop</a>‘s latest fire sale.</p> <p>Here’s just a sample:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Paradise Killer</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>What The Golf?</em></strong> – $8 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em></strong> – $20 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Moonlighter: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $4.34 (85 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>OlliOlli World</em> </strong>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Spiritfarer</em></strong> – $4.50 (85 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Disco Elysium</strong> – The Final Cut</em> – $12 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em></strong>– $15 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inscryption</em> </strong>– $7 (65 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death’s Door</em></strong> – $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition</em></strong> – $5 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></strong> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hotline Miami Collection</em></strong> – $5 (80 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Inside</em></strong> – $2 (90 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></strong> – $6.24 (75 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Slay the Spire</em> </strong>– $8.50 (66 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster</em></strong> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></strong> – $18 (70 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Civilization VI</em></strong> – $6 (80 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>A few special shout-outs. If you don’t have <em>Slay the Spire</em>, it’s a top-notch deck-building roguelike that you won’t be able to put down. <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, a loot shooter roguelike, is a similarly irresistible timesink. <em>Inside</em>, meanwhile, is an excellent cinematic platformer adventure game and, in my opinion at least, one of the best games ever made. It doesn’t get enough credit. Only $2? A steal!</p> <p>Finally, <em>Digimon Cybersleuth</em> is an incredibly meaty JRPG for just $5 (the series latest entry <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341">came out this fall</a>), and $15 is a great price for <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>, a wonderfully inventive and surprising visual novel/strategy game mash-up from Vanillaware.</p>

 <h2>The Switch 2 version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> gets its biggest discount yet</h2> <p>There are actually some decent Switch 2 deals right now, too. They’re nowhere near as good as the ones for games on the OG hardware, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077: The Ultimate Edition</em> in particular is just $40 until November 1. That’s 43 percent off the list price, which isn’t bad at all for a port that only arrived in June. It runs surprisingly well on Switch 2 and is a decent way to catch up on the best sci-fi open-world RPG of the decade (it also supports cross-saves if you already started on another platform).</p> <p>What else is on sale on the Switch 2 at the moment?<em> Sonic X Shadow Generations</em> is just $30 right now (40 percent off) and GOTY contender <em>Split Fiction</em> is just $40 (20 percent off). The Switch 2 port of <em>EA Sports Madden NFL 26</em> isn’t the best but it’s currently $20 off the standard price. So is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, a very solid lifestyle sim RPG that arrived back with the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this year.</p>

              <p>Canada’s Fan Expo is the nation’s largest geek-themed convention, attracting the crowds for its comics, sci-fi, horror, anime and gaming events, alongside big-name guests and their autograph-hunting acolytes. It also draws in a massive number of cosplayers, and where cosplay appears so does <em>Kotaku</em>‘s crack team of photographers from Mineralblu. We’ve put together a gallery of some of the best and most intriguing fits from the recent convention.</p> <p>2025’s Fan Expo was not short on big-name celebrities. Appearing at the event were the likes of <em>Star Wars’ </em>John Boyega, Tyler Hoechlin (aka the best Superman), the legendary Juliet Lewis, and <em>the</em> Michael J. Fox. (It’s worth noting that <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/celebrities/">next year’s event</a> has already managed to line up all four hobbits from the original&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies.) But we push such famous people aside, uninterested in their shiny faces, because we want to see the people dressing up as other famous people: the cosplayers.</p> <p>Mineralblu have sent us over a great mix, with some (now) traditional appearances from&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, some classics like a great Princess Leia, and some old-school <em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>, along with the outright unusual such as a Dry Bowser. Click on to see the fully gallery of amazing outfits.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-so-good-i%E2%80%99m-worried-it-will-completely-take-over-my-life.1329829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was hanging on for dear life this weekend. I spent about 13 hours in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ “Server Slam,” a test of the game’s servers and overall game stability ahead of its release on October 30, and it’s clear that the game clicked with me so well, I might hardly leave my apartment anymore. Farewell social life and other hobbies; <i>Arc Raiders</i> is nearly here and I don’t know if I can resist its call.</p> <p>A PvPvE extraction shooter, <i>Arc Raiders</i> makes for a rough experience, but also a thrilling one. It is also, clearly, the multiplayer game I’ve been searching for ever since it was announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-dmz-beta-warzone-dead-activision-1851066541"><i>Call of Duty</i>’s DMZ was headed for a slow, un-updated death</a>. So allow me to tell you of the unbelievable thrill that was <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a hostile game. That’s the point</h2>  <p>There’s no way around this: Extraction shooters are just mean. And <i>Arc Raiders</i> is <i>nasty</i>.</p> <p>The lone map provided during the Server Slam was replete with hiding spots from which you could plan an ambush. Though you can’t lay prone, it’s pretty easy to hide in bushes, and the interiors of buildings have their fair share of corners you can exploit. Survival is about keeping your head on a swivel and your ears perpetually open for random sounds that can signal the presence of a threat before you can see it.</p>

 <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, like many other extraction shooters, sticks you right in the midst of a fight-or-flight response and exploits that tension for a one-of-a-kind dopamine rush if you make it out alive, and one hell of a come-down should you fail. No, it’s not fun when you lose all your shit from a kill you could never see coming; yet somehow you need to push past that to find “fun.” It’s not for everyone.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9wwpk/when_your_best_isnt_good_enough/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Arc Raiders</i> is mean</a> in a way that a simple battle royale or team deathmatch just isn’t. You can die so quickly and, true to the genre’s conventions, death puts you at risk of losing your best gear. It often doesn’t feel fair; that’s a tough pill to swallow. Don’t worry, though; plenty of mean people will eventually get what they deserve in a later round when they inevitably push their luck too far. That’s just what this game is about: The deep, crushing feeling of loss is why the feeling of winning is so exhilarating. The highs are so high <i>because </i>of the depths of the lows.</p>

 <p>This is what I love about the PvPvE extraction genre: Everything matters and punishment is swift. The distant clap of gunfire isn’t set design, it’s an actual firefight that could quickly become your problem if you’re too close. You can hear nearby enemy players break into various loot caches, digging around for supplies, and that becomes a signal that you need to either GTFO or draw your weapon and be prepared. Enemy Arc drones and other machines are an essential part of this experience: They’re an opportunity for good loot, an engaging gun battle, or the best distraction in the world from enemy players who have you outgunned. The PvPvE is a triangle you rotate around.</p>

    <p>Fleeing battles during the Server Slam was sometimes as exhilarating as participating in them. The experience of trading shots with enemy players down long corridors of an abandoned water treatment facility, only to need to race down the labyrinthine maze of hallways, tossing smoke grenades behind me and barely making it to a door I can shut, giving me a precious few seconds to heal up and continue my escape or make a stand taps into something so exhilaratingly primal in my brain that even thinking about it makes my skin tingle a bit.</p>

    <p>Perhaps because it’s October and I’ve been on a huge survival horror kick in general, it dawned on me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/">extraction shooters and horror games</a> seem to poke at the same network of neurons in the human brain. Seeing another player can be a jumpscare; hell, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/">the game’s tumbleweeds</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa9ruw/every_signle_damn_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">random bits of garbage</a> that float around as set design often trigger a kind of PTSD response as, in order to survive, you do have to sort of assume anything that moves is a potential threat. I’ve shot a few tumbleweeds impulsively because surviving in this game means you have to close that distance between seeing a moving thing and shooting it.</p>    <p>And when things break out into full-on firefights with either human players or the game’s machines, it’s a spontaneous game of survival unlike anything else, given the real risk of dying and <i>not</i> respawning, losing your weapons and essential crafting loot. It’s a challenge to not let the lethality of the game consume you and turn your next run into a rage-filled revenge quest. The game is aware of this, as one of the post-death loading screens literally says “This could be an excellent start to your villain arc.”</p> <p>As one Redditor commented after suffering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9zr2w/i_tried_i_really_tried/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a humiliating betrayal by another player</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>I will never trust a raider again. It’s dog eat dog out there, and now this dog is hungry.</p></blockquote> <p>“Sure,” one Redditor replied, “it wasn’t a happy ending, but it’s a far more unique experience.” The risk of betrayal, the tender nature of any temporary alliance, the risk and reward, it’s what makes this whole thing so damn entertaining. Success is in rare supply, so you are regularly chasing it.</p>   <p>Fighting other humans is a ton of brutal, mean fun. But I was very surprised to find the game’s computer-controlled enemies, the E of the PvPvE triangle, were also great sparring partners and, interestingly, helpful informants.</p>

Other human players were added after developer Embark realized that simply fighting the game’s robots, collectively referred to as “Arc,” over and over again <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540">got old too fast</a>. And while I probably wouldn’t want to just play a game that pits me against these machines without human antagonistic forces, damn are they enjoyable pests to have roaming the skies.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvpve-extraction-division-dmz-2000631540"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ 2-Year Delay Explained: Game Was Boring</a></p> <p>Upon stepping out into the game’s post-apocalyptic maps, you’ll regularly see drones flying out in the distance, always keeping an eye on what’s going on underneath them. They come in a few varieties: drones with guns, drones that can summon other drones with guns, and of course the big ones that shoot rockets at you and are a literal terror. They’re deadly, sure, but their presence can also indicate where other players are, which is essential knowledge for survival. Arc drone behavior, whether they’re actively engaged in a firefight with other players or are searching for players they’ve caught sight of, sends a clear message: Either there’s a situation up ahead that you want to <i>avoid </i>or there’s a possible opportunity that you want to <i>exploit</i>. After all, looting a downed player is likely to net you a healthy injection of supplies and a decent chance to find a good weapon.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637363"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637363">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Drones let you know what you’re potentially getting yourself into while you’re traversing the map. They also make for unlikely temporary allies. On more than one occasion, I fired off shots at drones to lure them to my position to try and shake off some enemy players who were on my tail. Arc can rapidly change the dynamics of a firefight between players as they swiftly dart through the air and ignore the ground-level cover that players are hiding behind.</p>

 <p>And it seems much of the community shares my fondness for these airborne pests. <i>Thank the goddess</i>.</p> <p>One of the most up-voted threads, sitting just shy of 5k up arrows, on r/ArcRaiders is a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/"> plea to <i>not</i> nerf Arc</a> following the Server Slam. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oawvny/arc_are_not_overpowered_its_a_massive_skill_issue/">Arc’s lethality is the point</a>, others have argued, and they’re right.</p>   <p>Drones also offer a surprisingly fun test of marksmanship. They’re not just flying things for you to mindlessly pump bullets into for the sake of loot and experience points. You really have to place your shots well to come out alive. Shooting out the propellers on these machines can ground them faster than aiming at the core fuselage, but it also makes their flying behavior wildly erratic when a propeller or two is destroyed. Landing shots on them is as satisfying as nailing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting">clay pigeon</a> in real life–something I haven’t done since I was a kid, yet <i>Arc Raiders</i> tapped right into that old muscle memory. To top it off, drones carry pretty decent crafting supplies, so there’s good reason to fuck with them if you’re confident you can earn their loot unscathed.</p>  <p>Thanks to all the ways they make the action more dynamic, these airborne pests never frustrated me the way flying enemies in games usually do. They’re useful for dealing with other players and somehow exist in this Goldilocks zone of being a lethal challenge that’s surprisingly fun to take down.</p>

 <h2>Will <i>Arc Raiders</i> shatter the extraction shooter’s glass ceiling?</h2> <p>Extraction shooters have struggled to hit critical mass in the way that, say, battle royales have. At their most intense–when they incorporate rigid survival mechanics like hunger and thirst, deadly fall damage, and the need to keep track of specific calibers of ammo like you do in, say, <i>Escape From Tarkov</i>–they’re just too grueling to ever appeal to a mass audience.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> streamlines many of the genre’s survival trappings: There’s no hunger or thirst. You can move pretty fast for a “realistic” game and can survive some pretty steep falls if you jump off a ledge. And ammo is abstracted down to light, medium, heavy, and shotgun (at least as far as what was on offer in the Server Slam). It’s an easier game than many of its more hardcore peers, but it’s still punishing.</p>

 <p>The Server Slam also capped out at a certain level. The game has skill trees that you invest points into to up your survival skills, improving everything from how long you can sprint, to how quickly you can vault over objects, to how much noise you make while rummaging through the detritus of a fallen civilization.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637362"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637362">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Given the level cap of 15 in the Server Slam, this weekend saw the intensity only ratchet up to a certain point. Once players have the full game, I wonder how chaotic, or potentially unfair, some builds will be, and at what point <i>Arc Raiders</i> may struggle to sustain that Goldilocks zone of tension. The game could also use some more QOL features such as double or triple key bindings and maybe some better inventory management tools.</p>

 <p>Still, I haven’t been this optimistic about a multiplayer game all year and I’m hungering for this game to return in a way that worries me. When the servers went dark last night, I was quite sad.</p> <p>So if you don’t see me in real space after October 30 when this game launches, don’t be surprised. This game is going to be a problem for me, and I’m so here for it.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has some of the best character customization in Game Freak’s monster-taming series. Lumiose City’s wide array of fashion choices are a welcome change after </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>locked everyone into school uniforms, but the best addition is that none of these clothing items are gender-locked. So whether it’s skirts or long hair, whatever you see on the rack is yours to buy and wear as you please. The game is pretty fluid in how it lets players present themselves in the world, but even so, it’s got some gendered stuff in its story that some players aren’t thrilled about. However, the fashion freedom is helping people get around some of those limitations.</span></p> <p><span>When you pick your character’s initial appearance, you’re also picking whether the game will recognize them as male or female, regardless of what you’re wearing. However, you’re also picking who your rival is going to be. If you play as a male character, you’ll be greeted by a young girl named Taunie when you arrive in Lumiose City. Conversely, a female trainer will meet Urbain, a boy who has a similar role and aesthetic, but is otherwise a different person. At first, I kinda figured this split would be in service of some shoehorned, heterosexual romantic subplot, but thankfully it never came to that. I rolled credits last night and I’m still not a hundred percent sure what the point of having these two characters is, beyond giving the main cast an even gender divide. Maybe I’ll find out more as I make my way through the post-game. That said, some fans want to play as a girl and have Taunie on their team, or want to be a boy and hang out with Urbain. So while it’s not a perfect solution, some players are taking up crossdressing to present as one gender and still get their preferred rival.</span></p>
