              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is an extremely compact Alexa speaker that lets you better manage your smart home and enhances room audio capabilities compared to past Echo Dot speakers. It produces room-filling sound, and its new, larger, rounded design is covered in 3D-knit fabric that blends easily into a shelf or side table without drawing too much attention. Inside, the AZ3 chip supports Alexa+, and a built-in smart home hub lets you treat this speaker as a central point for both audio playback and smart home control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">You can pick up the Amazon Echo Dot Max on Amazon.com for $80, which is $20 off the normal $100 retail price, or 20% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A full-featured smart speaker with a variety of features</h2>
<p>One of the speaker’s strongest features is its ability to deliver a focused sound in each room, with emphasized low frequencies, clean highs, and very clear vocals. It delivers room-focused sound thanks to the auto-tune feature, which adjusts how the speaker plays back sound based on its location. In addition to streaming music using Amazon Music or Spotify, you can connect an unlimited number of compatible Echo products in order to have the exact same audio playing at the exact same time, effectively expanding the overall stereo experience or even creating a compact home theatre system through the connection of a second Echo Dot Max or pairing with a variety of Fire TV products.</p>



<p>The Echo Dot Max offers more than just playing your music and enabling multi-room audio. It allows you to connect directly to many of your smart home devices from the speaker, without a central hub. You can also group smart devices and create smart home routines that perform tasks based on both schedules and triggers. With OmniSense technology, you can also use presence or temperature detection as triggers, letting the room automatically warm up or cool down, or turn lights on and off based on your activity.</p>
<p>You can control much more than simply playing playlists on your Echo Dot Max through Alexa and Alexa+. This device lets you set a timer or reminder, check the weather, do quick math , or turn on/off your smart home devices with just your voice, without grabbing your smartphone. If you sign up for Alexa + Early Access, you will have a proactive assistant that can respond to layered requests and help you accomplish long-running or complicated tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">At $80, down from the original $100 price, the Echo Dot Max offers a compelling option</a> if you want a compact Alexa speaker with improved audio, built-in smart home capabilities, and support for Alexa+ at a lower cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Laptop 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station takes a single USB-C port and expands that into a full desktop experience for your laptop. All you have to do is attach one cable to your laptop, then use it as a springboard to connect multiple displays, wired accessories, a wired network, storage cards, and even an audio feed. Triple-monitor support lets you view spreadsheets, timelines, and references simultaneously, without constantly tabbing back and forth.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7026/">You can purchase the Anker Laptop 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station from Amazon for $140, down from its regular price of $200, for a $60 discount or 30% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7026/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An easy way to organize all your cables and devices at your workstation</h2>
<p>The 13-in-1 dock features a set of ports that replace individual dongles and chargers. On the front of the dock, you will find an 85W laptop charging USB-C port, a dedicated 18W Power Delivery USB-C port for charging mobile devices, a standard USB-C data port, three USB-A ports for peripherals, two HDMI outputs, one DisplayPort output, a Gigabit Ethernet jack, and slots for SD and microSD cards, plus a standard 3.5mm audio jack, and DC input for the included wall-wart style power supply. This array of ports lets you attach drives, card readers, wired headsets, and more without chaining additional adapters together.</p>
<p>With triple-monitor support and broad compatibility, this dock works with a wide variety of laptops. For example, you can use the two HDMI ports and the DisplayPort to attach up to three external monitors and stream media to all three in 1080p at 60Hz. Additionally, the dock has been tested and confirmed to work with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections, and is compatible with machines that support DisplayPort and USB Power Delivery.</p>



<p>While the dock is sending up to 85 watts back to a compatible laptop via the primary USB-C port, you can still fast-charge a phone or tablet via the 18W USB-C port using the same power supply brick. It also provides a reliable wired network connection via Gigabit Ethernet, and the dock makes it much easier to transfer video and photo files directly from your camera and/or drone to a computer without carrying separate card readers.</p>
<p>This docking station is designed to help reduce clutter by eliminating the need to chase cables and connectors in order to get started working. As long as your laptop is attached to the dock, you can leave your full-size keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers, and external drives connected to the dock and simply plug them in as needed.</p>
<p>The Anker Laptop 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station provides triple display support, a large number of ports, and a single-cable laptop charging solution at a significantly reduced cost, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7026/">it’s a great deal when you compare the sale price of $140 to the list price of $200.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of year again when Nintendo puts on a Direct showcase to talk about upcoming Switch and Switch 2 games. The company announced it will hold a livestream tomorrow, February 5, to talk about games coming to the handheld/console hybrid systems.</p> <p>The show will be about 30 minutes long, but don’t get ahead of yourself hoping to see the next&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros</em>. This is a partner showcase, which means that you can expect a lot of third-party games, rather than stuff in the works at Nintendo itself. The stream will begin at 6 a.m. Pacific / 9 a.m. Eastern.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> Partner Showcase livestream is on the way! Tune in tomorrow, Feb 5, at 6am PT for roughly 30 minutes of upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch games. </p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/BcCgVs6ozj">https://t.co/BcCgVs6ozj</a> <a href="https://t.co/fYhkHPRnbJ">pic.twitter.com/fYhkHPRnbJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2019048301518115090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So what should we expect if not Nintendo first-party games? With its additional power over the original Switch, the Switch 2 is able to run a pretty large spread of big-budget third-party games. Companies like Capcom are putting some of their big marquee games like <em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>and <em>Pragmata </em>on the device&nbsp;so, in theory, nothing’s really off the table if a dev is willing to make some concessions to get PS5 and Xbox games on the thing. Personally, I’d love to see&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2 </em>get a Switch 2 upgrade because I want to do my dailies on the go. We have a huge list of games that we’d like to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">ported to Switch 2</a>, but hopefully we also see some new games making their way to the system rather than just picking up the other consoles’ leftovers. It’s been a while since we saw From Software’s upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/duskbloods-switch-2-nintendo-fromsoftware-exclusive-1851774242"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, so maybe that’s on the table for this Direct.</p> <p>Whatever we see, we’ll be covering it here at&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> tomorrow morning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[INSIGNIA 55″ Smart Fire TV Hits Nearly 50% Off After Another Price Cut Ahead of Super Bowl, Cheaper Than Smaller Models]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/insignia-55%e2%80%b3-smart-fire-tv-hits-nearly-50-off-after-another-price-cut-ahead-of-super-bowl-cheaper-than-smaller-models-2000665535</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your entertainment setup is in need of a new screen, and you’re looking to upgrade to one without spending thousands, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7025/">The 55-inch Insignia Class F50 Series 4K LED smart TV is sitting at $180 at Amazon, after a whopping 49% off its retail price of $350.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it go for in a long while, and there are no delivery charges to worry about either. As you’d expect, deals this good tend to wrap up soon, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7025/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lifelike Picture Quality</h2>
<p>For well under $200, you’re getting a modest 55-inch screen. It’s not massive, but also not too small to make the content feel cramped. This size is perfect for smaller living areas, and even bedrooms if you prefer catching up on your favorite shows while getting cozy in a blanket!</p>
<p>Picture quality is better than most (if not all) options in the same price range. You’ll experience breathtaking HDR10 4K movies and TV shows with four times the resolution of Full HD – think brilliant detail, vivid colors, better sharpness, and a lifelike feel, regardless of what you’re streaming. It’s the kind of quality that even preserves detail in darker scenes, instead of just washing them out. You will be able to spot shadows while enjoying content just as the creator intended.</p>
<p>Of course, you need solid sound to match the visuals for a truly immersive experience. This TV, thankfully, delivers on that front, too. The DTS Virtual-X Sound compatibility delivers a rich, three-dimensional sound experience with the TV’s speakers, which pulls you into whatever’s playing on the screen. Expect audio to fill the room, with footsteps, whispers, mumbles, and laughter being heard clearly.</p>



<p>Then there’s Fire TV support, which brings all the popular streaming apps, like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and more in a single place. This way, you’ll never be out of content to watch. Maybe start the night by watching the latest crime thriller on Netflix, and then switch to Prime Video to end your session with an episode of The Office! Note that most of these platforms require monthly subscriptions to get started. Those looking to cut back on those will also appreciate the included free live Fire TV channels, such as Pluto TV and Tubi. Basically, there’s something for everyone, regardless of needs and preferences.</p>
<p>This TV also plays nicely with a wide range of other home theater components, such as a Blu-ray player, game console, speakers, cable/antenna, and more. The built-in TV connections include three HDMI ports, composite (AV) jacks, digital optical output, USB port, headphone jack, coaxial jack, Ethernet port, and Wi-Fi technology.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been looking to enjoy a solid streaming experience without spending a ton, this 55-inch Insignia Class F50 Series 4K LED smart TV is an excellent option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7025/">You can now grab it for just $180, after an impressive 49% drop</a>. Snap it up while the deal is still live, before the price shoots back up!</p>
