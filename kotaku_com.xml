              <p>We aren’t quite sure who to thank for this latest HP laptop deal at Amazon, but it’s kind of crazy how generous this one is. So, big shout-out to whomever is responsible for taking this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop, loading it with 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, and then installing the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, and deciding it should be over $3,000 less than the list price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Granted, that original $4,400 list price was more than a little bit silly, but even so, the final price of $1,140 for a state-of-the-art touchscreen Windows laptop</a> that arrives as loaded as this one does is more than a little bit crazy too. There’s also a free accessories bundle which includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a 7-in-1 USB hub, 128GB thumb drive, and more.</p>

<h2>Down to Business</h2>
<p>The Intel Ultra 7 255U processor would be a stone cold beast under any circumstance thanks to its max speed of 5.2GHz, but then when you add in the 12 TOPS of AI acceleration to drive the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant that’s preinstalled, that’s when the magic happens. Copilot’s bona fides as a top-notch AI assistant are well established, but the AI enhancements don’t end there — useful features like background blur and intelligent noise reduction for video calls and conferencing are also powered by AI.</p>
<p>The rest of the package under the hood of this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop is all about going big, especially the 64GB of DDR5 RAM that is basically a license to open as many tabs and apps as you want without fear of slowdown. That kind of workout also requires a fat storage capacity to hold all of your projects and other files, and this HP has a 2TB SSD ready and waiting.</p>



<h2>Roomy Everywhere You Look</h2>
<p>You can truly appreciate the 2TB of storage and the 64GB of RAM, but the other giant feature on this HP Business Laptop us the one you can actually see and touch — the beautiful 17.3-inch touchscreen display. Not only is there more than enough room for truly immersive streaming or as many windows as you want to open for multitasking, they’re all touch-controlled so this HP laptop can work like the world’s most powerful tablet.</p>
<p>Everything about this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is big, except its 0.81-inch thickness that makes it an easy backpack carry. The biggest feature of all is the price, or more accurately, the discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Amazon’s limited-time 74% off deal on this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop and its accessory bundle brings that price down to $1,140</a> — exceptionally good for a laptop this stacked.</p>
