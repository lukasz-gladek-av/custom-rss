              <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might not be the only massive sci-fi RPG on Switch 2 for long. Could <em>Starfield</em> get ported as well? Why is <em>Dead Space</em>‚Äòs old Creative Director all-in on AI? And How did an AI replica of a real content creator make its way onto the official <em>First Descendent</em> TikTok channel? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‚Äòs brief daily roundup of gaming culture and news, where we‚Äôre doing a bunch of clean-up from the first day of Gamescom 2025.</p>  <p>Podcaster NateTheHate, who‚Äôs quickly developed a reputation for accurate leaks around upcoming Nintendo announcements, now claims Bethesda‚Äôs open-world sci-fi RPG is coming to the company‚Äôs handheld hybrid next year. ‚Äú<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> won‚Äôt be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,‚Äù he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027">posted on X</a> yesterday. ‚ÄúSee that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5‚Ä¶<em>Starfield</em> is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.‚Äù FromSoftware‚Äôs <em>The Duskbloods</em> has also been confirmed for Switch 2 in 2026, and Nintendo has yet to reveal any of its expected slate for the console‚Äôs second year. <em>Starfield</em> is reportedly coming to PS5 next year as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">seemingly closer to whenever the second expansion launches</a>.</p> <h2><em>The First Descendent</em> blames TikTok for AI slop video</h2> <p>Nexon‚Äôs free-to-play loot shooter, also known as ‚ÄúGooner <em>Destiny</em>,‚Äù <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-ads-tiktok-the-first-descendant-nexon-2000618182">accidentally shared an AI-generated ad on TikTok</a> that ripped off another content creator. <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/3100882">The publisher now says</a> a TikTok marketing program automatically solicited the ad and linked it to <em>The First Descendants‚Äô</em> account with no controls to verify copyright infringement or other content concerns. Sounds bad! ‚Äú<span lang="EN-US">We will also be committed to continuously being more transparent and responsible to regain the trust of our community and creators,‚Äù the company writes. ‚Äú</span><span lang="EN-US">Once again, we deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this incident has caused.‚Äù</span></p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> could be coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">told <em>VGC</em></a> at Gamescom that Square Enix is in talks with Nintendo about porting the hit MMORPG over. ‚ÄúThe discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future,‚Äù he said. It sounds like <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> isn‚Äôt out of the question either. Yoshida added, ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs just my aim to provide <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and <em>16</em> to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games.‚Äù</p> <h2>The director of <em>Callisto Protocol</em> is going all-in on AI</h2> <p>Glen Schofield <a href="http://AI is going to be fantastic">told<em> The Game Industry</em></a> ‚ÄúAI is going to be fantastic.‚Äù He said he‚Äôs holding seminars about how AI can make creatives more efficient and thinks the technology will be an inevitable part of game development in 5-10 years, but he‚Äôs not sure exactly how it will all shake out. ‚ÄúIs it going to be an engine?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now, it‚Äôs a whole bunch of things that just kind of suck it in‚Ä¶ and into what? It‚Äôs going to have to settle down a bit before we actually use it.‚Äù Schofield also claimed<em> Callisto Protocol</em> sold over 5 million copies, but regretted not delaying it. He said AAA games are not dead and is looking for someone to pay him to make another.</p> <h2><em>High on Life 2</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>The sci-fi comedy shooter <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/">will arrive</a> on PC and console, including on Game Pass, on February 13, 2026. Ralph Ineson, best known as Cid in <em>FF16</em> and more recently Galactus in <em>The</em> <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, will be voicing the newest gun in the game.</p>

 <h2><em>Triangle Strategy</em> shadow-drops on Xbox</h2> <p>The HD-2D homage to games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was previously a Switch exclusive on console. Square Enix‚Äôs port is <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958158169240371511">now on Xbox</a> with a starting discount of 30 percent off.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> comes to PS5 in November</h2> <p>The survival horror shooter <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1958150213127798847">makes the jump</a> on November 20 as more former Xbox console exclusives get ported and help round-out Sony‚Äôs previously anemic 2025 release slate.</p> <h2>The biggest lines at Gamescom are for <em>Silksong</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS IS THE LINE OF HOLLOW KNIGHT SILKSONG ON PRESS DAY AT 9AM. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gamescom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gamescom</a> <a href="https://t.co/lNz1q62AZ5">pic.twitter.com/lNz1q62AZ5</a></p> <p>‚Äî Daan K. üîú Gamescom 2025 (@NintenDaan) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenDaan/status/1958063065150226808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel is getting a special announcement on August 21‚Äî<a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">a release date, hopefully?</a>‚Äîbut in the meantime, attendees at Gamescom are making the <em>Silksong</em> demos at the Nintendo and Xbox booths the highlights of the show so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-offers-buttery-smooth-performance-on-switch-2">Nintendo Life&nbsp;already went hands-on</a> and confirmed the Metroidvania Soulslike supports 120Hz refresh on Switch 2 in TV mode.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">Kirby Air Riders has a release date and looks refreshingly old-school</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">Rod Fergusson is trying to save BioShock a second time</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/denshattack-train-game-tony-hawk-anime-onl-gamescom-2025-trailer-2000618578">This Japanese train game was the best thing revealed at Gamescom</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hidden SECRETS In GTA 3" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBpNWVDQ5QM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p><span>These days, most AAA video game companies are struggling to gain and maintain momentum in a fickle marketplace when games are taking longer than ever to make. Capcom, meanwhile, is on a hot streak. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573"><i><span>Dragon‚Äôs Dogma 2</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i></a><span>, and the continued renaissance of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i></a> <span>series are just a few examples of the developer being in a no-skips, all-hits era. I recently got a chance to play three of the company‚Äôs upcoming games: </span><i><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, and my limited time with each spoke both to the variety in the company‚Äôs line-up, but also indicated a refreshing ‚Äúback to basics‚Äù mentality that a lot of AAA companies can‚Äôt seem to fathom in 2025. These games feel like they‚Äôre from a different era, and that‚Äôs for the better.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 3rd Trailer: The Genma Experiments | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bf1cAQIKpWA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword </span></i><span>was the first game I played during my preview session, and after 20 years away, the latest </span><i><span>Onimusha </span></i><span>feels surprisingly untouched by the RPG trappings that have latched onto many modern action games. The section I played was the same one I saw at Summer Game Fest, which showed samurai warrior Musashi Miyamoto slicing his way through a mostly derelict village overrun by underworldly monsters. At first blush, </span><i><span>Way of the Sword </span></i><span>might feel a bit simple to the modern action game fan who has become so used to skill trees and Soulslike difficulty. But there was a time in the PlayStation 2 era when a good parry and dodge mechanic was enough to satisfy you for about 10 to 15 hours.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I played </span><i><span>Way of the Sword</span></i><span>, I was caught off guard by how ‚Äúof its time‚Äù it felt. It‚Äôs as if it picks up where the series left off 20 years ago, but with a bit of modern flair and finesse. The boss fight at the end of the demo against Ganryu Sasaki, a fellow Oni Gauntlet-wearing swordsman, was challenging enough to prove that skillful swordplay is enough to carry an action game in 2025, even as the genre more frequently de-emphasizes those core fundamentals.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pragmata - First Contact Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>That same streamlined focus was evident when I played </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span>. I already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342"><span>wrote up impressions of the demo</span></a><span> I played at Summer Game Fest, and this appointment was mostly focused on the same early section of the game, just with a boss fight at the end. Like </span><i><span>Way of the Sword</span></i><span>, the sci-fi puzzle shooter feels like something plucked out of a previous generation. Its over-the-shoulder shooting, brutalist sci-fi aesthetic, and dad game setup make it feel exactly like something you would‚Äôve seen on a GameStop shelf during the PS360 generation. As I said back in June, it keeps from feeling like a rote retread of old tropes by combining its shooting with a real-time puzzle-solving element that has you breaking down enemy defenses and opens a window for your bullets to actually do real damage. Separately, these mechanics are simple and perhaps unremarkable; together, they create a big-budget shooter that would have been the kind of fun, one-off experiment a company like Capcom would have released between big sequels. Even as Capcom has put out hit after hit, the company has become pretty reliant on sequels in the same way pretty much every other AAA developer has. It‚Äôs refreshing to see that it still has the chops to put out something like </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span>, a non-sequel which may pull from old motifs, but also feels novel as games like it have gone out of style in recent years.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>That brings us to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, the latest entry in a series that has spent the better part of a decade reinventing itself. What I played of the ninth mainline game in the long-running survival horror series felt more evocative of </span><i><span>Haunting Ground</span></i><span>, a cult classic hide-and-seek horror game Capcom put out in 2005, than the misadventures of Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy. As we see more of it, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>may eventually adopt the more action-oriented flow of 2021‚Äôs </span><i><span>Resident Evil Village </span></i><span>or stay in the escape room-esque hide-and-seek loop of the segment I played, but in the demo&nbsp; section, at least, it felt like the game had been stripped down to its core elements to leave you with a terrifying helplessness. All I had to defend myself from a horrifying monstrosity that followed me back and forth through a dimly lit hallway was my wits, glass bottles, and whatever light sources I could find to scare it away. </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>has been experimenting with what it means to carry that name for a while, and so perhaps it‚Äôs fitting that what I played of </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>didn‚Äôt make me think of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> much at all, but rather of a </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/after-20-years-capcom-removes-its-website-for-controversial-usd500-ps2-horror-game-and-i-know-the-bad-ending-might-get-you-pregnant-but-im-prepared-to-stage-a-funeral-if-there-isnt-a-remake/"><span>long-lost gem that Capcom has mostly forgotten</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All three of these games are coming out in 2026, and by then, we‚Äôll be another trip around the sun removed from the games that seemingly inspired each of them, and they could feel even more out of time. Even so, Capcom‚Äôs dedication to the old ways of doing things, when it feels like every other month we‚Äôre hearing about a beloved franchise or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>company</span></a><span> being handcuffed to&nbsp; modern practices solely meant to make every game a time suck, is a big part of the reason it‚Äôs put out mostly bangers for the past few years. I‚Äôm not usually one to say ‚Äúthings were better back in my day,‚Äù but it is nice to have reminders that not every developer has learned the wrong lessons. At least one major player is willing to go back to the well, find what worked before, and meaningfully iterate on it instead of breaking it apart to turn it into something we no longer recognize.</span></p>
