But it’s still an awful lot of attention for a game that Ubisoft had appeared to treat like a flop following its 2024 release.</p><p>However, today’s post is rather unambiguously stating that there’s more <em>Prince of Persia</em> to come, at the very least.

We also know that <em>Dead Cells</em> developer Evil Empire is still working on <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, released into Early Access almost a year ago. So it wouldn’t be that. Put it this way: If it’s <em>not</em> meant to tell us there are plans for a sequel to <em>The Lost Crown</em>, then someone’s fucked up.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Ubisoft, asking them to at least tell us not to get our hopes up if this is not the case, and will update when they get back to us.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you can request that the Support Ship prioritizes certain items for its next visit, its stock cycles through a pool of items. This means that Commission Tickets are not always guaranteed. It can feel like quite the rare sight to see even one at times.</p><p>Thankfully, there are ways to cheese through this and collect them all. <strong>Commission Tickets have a chance to show up when you’ve requested Equipment Materials or Misc. Items</strong>. You’ll want to request goods from those categories first. The next step to increase your chances is to purchase all the weapons you see. These are one-off items that are never replaced in stock, which means you can filter them out of the pool and make it more likely for Commission Tickets to show up.</p><p>All of this is dragged out by how long it takes to see new Support Ship stock. <strong>If you’re not feeling patient and want these materials sooner than later, you can always choose to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094"><strong>skip ahead by resting</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong> The Support Ship weighs anchor for three days and then leaves for another three to gather items for you. It will take up to 3000 Guild Points to keep using the Rest mechanic, but it’s a lot faster than hunting for six in-game days to pass the time.</p><p><strong>My final suggestion for farming Commission Tickets is to do a bit of save scumming</strong>. Keep track of when the Support Ship will dock and save the day before. Rest in your tent to advance the day, and then go out and check what’s in stock. If there are no Commission Tickets available, return to the main menu without saving and reload your save. Keep checking the newly generated stock until it includes what you need.</p><h2 id="h447697"><a id=""></a>How to use Commission Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-recommend-id="image://cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-recommend-id="image://cc71a3575eec8414e7e900de5c88d993" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Lance Weapon Tree screen, showing off the Paladin Lance I." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All you’re told is to take these to the Smithy, which isn’t a helpful suggestion with how many options Gemma has. There isn’t any special interaction to look out for–<strong>Commission Tickets are just used as materials to forge specific weapons and armor</strong>. To be more precise, it’s used for two weapons, both of their upgraded forms, and a full set of armor. Here is the equipment that requires Commission Tickets:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Jawblade</li><li>Giant Jawblade</li><li>Paladin Lance</li><li>Babel Spear</li><li>Commission Helm Alpha</li><li>Commission Mail Alpha</li><li>Commission Vambraces Alpha</li><li>Commission Coil Alpha</li><li>Commission Greaves Alpha</li></ul><p>It’s worth crafting the armor set for the great equipment skills attached to its pieces. I also think they look pretty stylish and worth using the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-appearance-cosmetics-transmog-1851772498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-appearance-cosmetics-transmog-1851772498">transmog system</a></span> for. Your mileage will vary with the weapons, as it likely depends on whether you enjoy using the Great Sword and Lance. I’d argue that it’s worth crafting them eventually, if not for completion’s sake, then to use some fun mechanics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attacks</a></span> or Stalwart Guard.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
