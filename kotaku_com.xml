              <p>Want to add a new monitor to your technology arsenal? Whether you are a serious gamer or someone looking into serious gaming, a good gaming monitor is a key part of your arsenal. We’ve found one that you can both save a significant amount of money on and also experience some fantastically deep immersion with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">Thanks to Amazon, you can pick up the ASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P HDR Monitor for only $179 which is a $70 discount (28% off) compared to the monitors’ normal price of $249.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardy monitor that’s great for any home office or gaming setup</h2>
<p>The ASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P HDR Monitor combines a 27” QHD (2560 x 1440) Fast IPS panel with a super-fast 180Hz refresh rate into a monitor designed to bring a high level of smoothness and clarity to your gaming action. A 1ms gray-to-gray response time along with support for HDR visuals help to ensure your games remain clear even as the action increases. Adaptive sync technology can help eliminate stuttering or tearing while maintaining a smooth frame pace so you don’t have to worry about a sluggish picture.</p>
<p>This monitor also has FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatibility to allow your graphics card to match frame output to the panel’s refresh rate. ASUS’ Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync is a feature that combines with variable refresh rate technology by utilizing backlight strobe to eliminate ghosting while maintaining smooth motion. The result is a clearer picture of fast moving objects, detailed game worlds, and detailed HUD elements when you are panning or tracking around in-game.</p>



<p>The Fast IPS panel used in the monitor can cover 130% of the sRGB color space and support HDR10 content. That means you’ll get brighter highlights, darker shadows, and more vivid colors than a standard SDR monitor. The 2560 x 1440 native resolution also gives more real estate than 1080p.</p>
<p>ASUS also includes GamePlus and GameVisual preset modes, which let you switch between different visual profiles and on-screen overlays optimized for the type of content you are viewing. Using DisplayWidget Center allows you to access and control monitor settings from your computer rather than having to go back and forth switching between on-screen menu options and physically adjusting monitor controls.</p>
<p>When taken together, these specifications combine to make a 27-inch gaming monitor that offers a balance of high-quality QHD resolution, ultra-high refresh rates and helpful customization capabilities at a price that won’t break the bank. So if you’re truly looking for quality that you don’t have to compromise on, this might very well be the monitor you add to your setup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">At the very least, grab it while it’s discounted because someone in your brood may want it other than you.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would Microsoft secretly be happier if people stopped buying the Xbox entirely? Would you risk breaking a $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold to chase a high score? And why was <em>League of Legends</em> unplayable for so many people over the weekend? You’ve stumbled onto another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Welcome to the first full week of 2026 where I am obsessed with the idea that the first act in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might have been even longer. Creative director Igor Sarzyński <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">explains why that would have been a terrible idea</a>. “No it wouldn’t. It’s like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.” RIP Jackie.</p>

 <h2>Not selling Xboxes must be intentional at this point</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales of Xbox consoles were down 39% in the UK during 2025, making it comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox consoles. With the return of favourite Xbox franchises in 2026, might things improve this year?</p> <p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/2007156688923836635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Game Business’ Chris Dring reports that 2025 was “comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox console” sales in the UK. They were down nearly 40 percent from the year prior, which was already far from stellar. I’m not sure how to square Microsoft’s seemingly complete abdication of hardware sales less than five years into the current generation with its promise to continue making consoles in the future.</p>

 <h2><em>League of Legends</em> was completely unplayable yesterday and the reason is very stupid</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1q4ao9r/per_vandiril_apparently_the_login_issues_were/">According to YouTuber Vandiril</a>, Riot Games forgot to renew the client security certificate for the hit Moba game. There was a workaround, however. All players had to do to get back into the game was reset their system clock. Maybe it was just the Nexus’ way of telling fans it was time to take a break.</p>

 <h2>Finally, a Flappy Bird made just for folding phones</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone companies: We've tested our hinge mechanism for 200,000 folds, so that should cover 5 years of use</p> <p>Users: <a href="https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk">https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk</a></p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2007546884794249262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Foldy Bird</em> requires you to physically fold your super expensive phone over and over again to keep the bird flying through the familiar <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-style environment. How neat! I still don’t want one.</p>

 <h2>Sega co-founder David Rosen has passed away</h2>   <p>Rosen was integral to the company’s amusement game operation, including the push into coin-operated arcade games like <em>Periscope</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Monaco GP</em>, <a href="https://www.replaymag.com/segas-dave-rosen-passes-on-christmas-day-in-l-a/"><em>RePlay Magazine</em> reports</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> originally began with a cut chapter starring Ashley</h2> <p>That’s according to modder Michael “Thekempy” Kemp who combed the game’s files and restored the lost content. “It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night,” Thekempy explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU?autoplay=1">in a recent video</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-cut-an-entire-opening-chapter-that-starred-ashley"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>). “She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice.”</p>

 <h2>Brandon Sanderson’s <em>Mistborn</em> books could become a video game</h2> <p>The prolific fantasy author said multiple AAA game companies have expressed interest in his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOe7VV5T-hw">State of Sanderson</a>” video (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mistborn/brandon-sanderson-mistborn-game">PCGamesN</a></em>). “I’m trying to do things differently this time, in order to retain control of my videogame rights,” he told fans. “I already have interest from some major players in the videogame industry, who I like a lot. So, if you are a decision-maker at a triple-A studio or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a <em>Mistborn</em> or <em>Stormlight</em> game, you would want to contact my reps now.” If someone bites, maybe we’ll see the actual game by 2032.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">The 10-year journey to falling back in love with <em>Minecraft</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">Microsoft wants you to move beyond calling it AI slop</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4-ps5-port-hacker-limited-run-2000656482">An obscure<em> Star Wars</em> game is more expensive than ever thanks to a rumored PS5 hack</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Buying a new smartphone can be pricey, especially if you’re going with one that’s still relatively new. But with the deal we’ve sourced, you can get one that’s still well worth using without taking out a second mortgage. You’re likely familiar with it if you’re an Android user: the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/">If you’re interested in changing up what you use for your daily driver phone, you can buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra on Amazon right now for $1,049</a>. That’s $250 (or 19%) lower than the retail price of $1,299.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A newer smartphone that’s still well worth using</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in a Titanium Silverblue housing that has a massive 6.9″ display, a 5000mAh battery and a built-in S Pen. It also comes with a US 1-year warranty and runs with unlocked Android 15 and One UI 7 out of the box.</p>
<p>Inside, the phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB of RAM to make sure you have enough power to run your apps/games/multitask between them. The 256 GB of internal storage means you have enough room for all of your pictures/videos/downloads without having to constantly clear everything out.</p>
<p>For connectivity, you have Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi and USB, so you can pair your accessories, pay for purchases using contactless payment methods and tether with other devices. Samsung’s One UI 7 sits atop Android 15 and utilizes the hardware specs along with AI tools and Samsung’s services.</p>
<p>The built-in S Pen lets you draw, write, and annotate screenshots and navigate their screen with accuracy, while the Always On Display provides access to important information at a glance at any time. Additionally, the high-resolution 2960 x 1440 resolution provides for clear text and images displayed on-screen and provides a lot of space for working in a multi-tasking mode or viewing high-definition video. The dimensions of the phone are 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches, providing a fairly small frame around the large display.</p>



<p>In terms of the camera capabilities of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung pushes hard on AI features, specifically on low-light and video recording. Samsung developed an AI Night Mode Camera to brighten dark areas and hold onto detail, so when taking a picture at night or indoors, the image does not immediately become blurry/noisy. Audio Eraser is a tool that can reduce background noise in your recorded videos, and there are a suite of other options you can use as well.</p>
<p>The Now Brief feature is intended to provide you with useful information prior to the time you would normally receive notifications for these same items (e.g. reminders/tasks), to help you keep up with everything going on in your life. Additionally, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is capable of rapid charging (and wireless charging), and the device is water-resistant, adding to its durability for everyday use.</p>
<p>If it’s been long past time to pick up a new smartphone,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6661/"> the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a fantastic choice that you won’t want to miss out on, especially since you can save some serious cash here</a>. Grab it and migrate over.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Goes Full Clearance on MacBook Air (2025 M4, 13″) at Record Low to Make Room for the 2026 Laptop Lineup]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-full-clearance-on-macbook-air-2025-m4-13-at-record-low-to-make-room-for-the-2026-laptop-lineup-2000656510</link>
            <guid>1397176</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that its officially 2026, Apple waited no time at all to discount its 2025 model of the MacBook Air. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">Amazon is currently Apple MacBook Air with the M4 chip, priced at just $799—down from the regular $999.</a> This 20% price cut saves you $200, making it one of the deepest reductions since its release last year. It’s a great opportunity to kick off the new year with a powerful, versatile laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Everyday Performance</h2>
<p>The 13-inch 2025 MacBook Air remains a top pick for those who want portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 2.7 pounds and boasting a sleek design, it continues the Air’s legacy of being incredibly lightweight while delivering the power of larger machines. Despite its slim build, it comes with a 10-core CPU, up to a 10-core GPU, and supports up to 24GB of memory. With the new M4 chip, this laptop performs up to twice as fast as the M1 MacBook Air and is up to 23 times quicker than Intel-based versions of the Air.</p>
<p>Apple designed the M4 chip with Apple Intelligence in mind, optimizing the system for faster task execution, efficient information processing, and handling demanding workflows effortlessly. The MacBook Air stays smooth and responsive whether you’re working on reports, editing videos, or managing multiple tabs.</p>



<p>If you’re often on the go and need long-lasting battery life, the MacBook Air delivers. Apple claims it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge, easily getting you through an entire workday. The 12MP front camera, with 1080p video capability, is perfect for virtual meetings, classes, or chatting with friends and family. The three-microphone array ensures crystal-clear sound, eliminating the need for external microphones.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard makes typing easy in low-light environments, and Touch ID gives you a quick and secure way to unlock your laptop. On the sides, you’ll find two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and connecting peripherals. The MagSafe charging port keeps your power cable securely in place but detaches safely if pulled. Plus, after all these years, Apple has kept the headphone jack in tact—a nice bonus for those who prefer wired audio.</p>
<p>If you’re already part of the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air makes it easy to sync with your iPhone, iPad, or other Apple devices via features like AirDrop, iMessage, and Handoff.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">The MacBook Air is discounted in several configurations. The 256GB model is the most affordable, priced at $799</a>. The 512GB version is now $999. For those who need more memory, the model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is $1,200. Each of these represent a $200 discount from their original list prices. Choose from four stylish colors: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads This Ryzen 7 Mini PC at Its Lowest Price (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), Cheaper Alternative to the Mac Mini]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-this-ryzen-7-mini-pc-at-its-lowest-price-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-cheaper-alternative-to-the-mac-mini-2000656576</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a new desktop computer can be a bit of a bear, especially if you want something that can both save you some space and money. But because we’re here to help, we’ve found something that satisfies both conditions and then some: the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop wth an AMD Ryzen 7 processor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">You can purchase the KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop for $499 from Amazon (originally priced at $699), which nets you a discount of $200 or 29% off.</a> That’s nothing to sneeze at, so if you’re ready to plunk your cold, hard cash down on, it’s go time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mini PC that has all the bells and whistles of its larger cousin</h2>
<p>The KAMRUI AM21 Mini Desktop features an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 5600 MHz memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 NVME PCIe 4.0 SSD in a space-saving desktop chassis. This is an 8-core, 16-thread chip that runs up to 4.9 GHz and has integrated Radeon 780M graphics that provide smooth 1080P gaming resources. In other words, it’s deceptively powerful, despite its small size. And that means you can put it just about anywhere and still expect some serious performance.</p>
<p>Storage begins with a 1 TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD, but there are two M.2 2280 slots available for expansion. These can accommodate up to 4 TB of NVMe storage. Although the listing mentions that SATA SSD expansion is not supported, users will need to utilize NVMe SSDs when expanding their storage.</p>



<p>This mini-desktop ships with Windows 11 Pro, KAMRUI Care support, and Amazon’s standard product support options. That means there are tons of ways to get help, so if you find yourself needing it, it’s there for you. You never know what kinds of issues can crop up when you’re setting up a new computer.</p>
<p>Pound for pound, this is a small but mighty computer that can replace a typical desktop or laptop, depending on which one you use regularly. And you can’t forget how much you’re saving on it, as well as how small it is in comparison to the commonly-accepted desktops on the market. You can get a ton done with it, and then some. Then you’ll even have some money left over to buy accessories or other items should you need to finish outfitting your work area. Or your casual home office, whichever ends up becoming true.</p>
<p>If your New Year’s resolution is to get a better PC that can improve your productivity and make things easier, this is an excellent pick. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6659/">Just act quickly, because this deal likely won’t be around for long, and it isn’t the type of discount you’ll not want to sink your teeth into.</a></p>
