But if it’s bad now, just wait until May 30 when Destined Rivals is officially released.</p><p>Journey Together should have been the very exciting return of Trainer Pokémon to the card game but instead proved rather flat, failing to significantly shake up the format. But it seems this was just a tentative toe poked into the waters, because this month we’re getting Destined Rivals, which not only enormously elaborates on the range of Trainer Pokémon, but also reintroduces Team Rocket to the TCG for the first time in 25 years. And yes, that means there’s a Giovanni’s Mewtwo, and yes, it’s already at a colossal price in Japan.</p><p>The full official English-language line-up has yet to be revealed, but The Pokémon Company has shown a fair few, a bunch more have appeared in Spanish, and there are many more we know are coming from the Japanese set. So based on all of this, we’ve put together the most anticipated cards that’ll be included in Destined Rivals (not to be confused with the <em>Black &amp; White: Rival Destinies</em> anime).</p><p>It’s going to be tough to find them on sale, but it’s worth knowing that pre-release events take place  on May 17—definitely check to see if your local specialist store has tickets. Scalpers can’t abuse this, because to get your packs you need to open and play with them!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Supporter card Ariana is hardly groundbreaking (it allows you to draw cards until you have five in your hand, or eight if all your benched Pokémon are Team Rocket Pokémon), the art here really is. The Japanese version of the set contains three of these Team Rocket Supporter full-art cards, along with Giovanni and Ethan, and all three look highly collectible, but this Ariana is the sort of profile work you almost never see in the TCG.</p><p>It’s selling for about $35 in Japan, but I suspect the U.S. version will fetch much higher prices.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Kotaku</em>’s own Ethan has a high showing in this set, starting off with these two versions of the Ho-Oh ex. Both are absolutely stunning cards in dramatically different ways, and my guess is that the version on the right may fetch around $150 when it launches. There will also be a gold version of this card, and I’ll be curious to see if it generates interest.</p><p>It’s also a hell of a card, given you can use it to load up all your Ethan Pokémon with energy each turn, and  when in the Active Spot it’ll deal out a massive 160 damage, while healing <em>every single one</em> of your Pokémon in play by 50. I think there are going to be a lot of Ethan-based decks coming soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stick Typhlosion in that deck too, and you can deliver two very powerful attacks. Once it’s evolved, it’ll do 40 damage for just one energy, but then add on another 60 damage for every Ethan’s Adventure card in your discard pile.</p><p>But clearly I’m including this one for the <em>spectacular</em> artwork. What an absolute beauty. In Japan, the big money cards are mostly Team Rocket, but I think this looks good enough that it’ll fetch a hefty resell value on its own merits.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan, of course from Gen 2's <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>, has a fair few cards in the set, including starter Cyndaquil, Magcargo, and the mighty Pichu. All three are celebrated in this outlandishly lovely card, Ethan’s Adventure.</p><p>The card itself helps you fetch Ethan’s Pokémon from your deck, of course going into your discard pile at the same time in order to power up Typhlosion.</p><p>But, also, look how flipping cute this is!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Cough. Yes, obviously this card’s going to do well. Everyone loves Misty, some rather too much, and here she is in her swimming cozzie. It does help that it’s also a completely lovely piece of art, with Psyduck looking so cute.</p><p>The Japanese version, from Heat Wave Arena, seems to sell for around $26, which is incredibly low. I imagine it’ll be double that in English by this time next month.</p><p>Its ability allows you to discard the bottom card of your deck, and then when done, discard any cards attached to the Psyduck and put the card back on the top of your own deck. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Team Rocket and Crobat are old friends, so this is no surprise. But wowsers, what a card. It looks stunning. </p><p>It helps that when you first evolve to it, you can put 20 damage on your opponent’s Stage 2 cards. Then, when you use it to do that 120 attack, you have the option to return it to your hand. Oh, and the 310 HP is ludicrous.</p><p>This is the third-highest-selling card from Japan’s The Glory of Team Rocket set, currently selling for around $120.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look at Giovanni! He’s so cute! That’s definitely not right. I love it.</p><p>Meowth is, of course, a Team Rocket fixture, and it’s great to see him hanging out with the boss rather than Jessie or James.</p><p>Here, Meowth is his usual mischievous self, the first “attack” letting you pick a card at random from your opponent’s hand, look at it, and then have it shuffled back into their deck.</p><p>The second is a triple-coin toss, with 20 damage per heads flipped.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Moltres is always an incredibly popular card (although it seems to only ever hit the ridiculous money when it also features Zapdos and Articuno, which this does not). Add that to a Team Rocket special, then combine with this astonishing piece of art, and you have a total banger.</p><p>The Japanese version is already fetching $190 for U.S. buyers, so expect this card to go stellar. I wouldn’t be surprised to see $250, unless it ends up being used as a promo. </p><p>That 110 attack also reduces damage from the next incoming attack by 50, but that’s as nothing compared to its four-energy move. Here, if you have a Team Rocket Energy card attached to it, you discard that energy, causing your opponent’s active Pokémon to be instantly discarded too! It’s a one-hit kill, and you can keep the card in play!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is the top-selling card in Japan’s Heat Wave Arena, and currently sells in the U.S. for over $230. That seems likely to spike an awful lot higher come June, and given the mediocrity of it as an ex card in play, we can likely put this down to the rarity and the spectacular artwork.</p><p>A 100 damage attack for one energy is amazing, and 260 for two energy is bonkers (even if you do have to discard it all), but given this is a Stage 2 evolution, it’s not going to be super-easy to get into play.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is the big one. It’s Giovanni, it’s Mewtwo, it’s sending everyone crazy. Prices are still climbing for the Japanese version out of The Glory of Team Rocket, at the time of writing sitting at $435.</p><p>Personally, I’m not a fan  of the art here. Neither the style nor the composition. But then, hey, when I pull it I won’t mind parting with it for the big cash! It’s hard to say how big Destined Rivals is going to be, but if it’s as daft as I’m suspecting, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this hitting $600.</p><p>It’s a tricky card to play, however, with a sort of reverse-ability. An inability, if you will. You need at least three other Team Rocket Pokémon in play to even be able to use its attacks, which means it’s only going to work in decks built around the troublesome gang, and then you’ll depend on the draw.</p><p>However, in return you get a heck of an attack for a Basic card. Mewtwo delivers 160 damage as a base, but that can go up to a whopping 280 if you also discard two energy cards from your benched Pokémon.</p><hr><p>There are a whole bunch of other spectacular pieces of art in our combination of the two Japanese sets (plus some other leftovers), and we’ll properly get into celebrating them once the set’s released and we’ve got all the cards in English.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To some, it’s all about the power creep; it’s about becoming stronger, more robust than your opponent, wielding the best weapons and armor in the game. But the struggle to attain that doesn’t matter to some—those who are more than happy to tinker with the very code operating behind the scenes of every successful quest. If that’s you, then you’ll be satisfied to hear all about the cheats and console commands in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>; some will even let you become the god of Cyrodiil.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197533" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#commands&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#commands">Console commands you need to know</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#console&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#console">How to use the console</a></span></p><h2 id="h833175"><a id="commands"></a>Cheats and console commands you need to know</h2><figure id="" data-id="e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-recommend-id="image://e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-recommend-id="image://e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you start messing around in the <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>console, you’ll soon learn that there are many, many cheats and commands within.

The difficulty of hunting a specific Tempered Monster is a great way to tell which Hunter Symbol you can receive. Five-star quests provide Hunter Symbol I, six-star quests provide Hunter Symbol II, and both seven-star and eight-star quests provide Hunter Symbol III. We’ve also provided a breakdown below of which Tempered Monsters are connected to which material: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Hunter Symbol I:</strong> Balahara, Chatacabra, Congalala, Gypceros, Lala Barina, Nerscylla, Quematrice, Rathian, Rompopolo, Yian Kut-Ku</li><li><strong>Hunter Symbol II:</strong> Ajarakan, Blangonga, Doshaguma, Gravios, Guardian Doshaguma, Guardian Ebony Odogaron, Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, Hirabami, Rathalos, Xu Wu</li><li><strong>Hunter Symbol III:</strong> Arkveld, Gore Magala, Jin Dahaad, Nu Udra, Rey Dau, Uth Duna</li></ul><h2 id="h38612"><a id="farm"></a>How to farm Hunter Symbols</h2><figure id="" data-id="aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-recommend-id="image://aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The World Map screen, with the Save as Investigation option highlighted for a Tempered Lala Barina field survey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The World Map screen, with the Save as Investigation option highlighted for a Tempered Lala Barina field survey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-recommend-id="image://aa61384ead5c113d1a5770a5c6ac10b4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The World Map screen, with the Save as Investigation option highlighted for a Tempered Lala Barina field survey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Tempered Monsters will spawn randomly across the different locations you’ve unlocked, same as as any other monster; this means you can just create Field Survey quests whenever you see them. Some beasts that reward you with Hunter Symbol I and Hunter Symbol II can also be hunted repeatedly by completing specific Optional Quests. Repeating these Optional Quests is arguably the best way to farm the two lower-level Hunter Symbol materials.</p><p>Your options decrease when it comes to gathering the highest rarity. There aren’t any pre-made quests for Hunter Symbol III-related monsters, so your only choice is to wait for them to appear and create a Field Survey quest. The good news is that we can still use this to our advantage. <strong>After creating a Field Survey quest for these difficult Tempered Monsters, make sure to select the Save as Investigation option.</strong> This will add it to Alma’s Investigations tab and lets you fight that specific monster three more times. It might cost you some Guild Points, but it’s certainly worth farming for Hunter Symbol III, as well as materials to craft Artian weapons.</p><p><strong>Another fantastic way to farm for Hunter Symbols is through SOS Flare Quests.</strong> Filter the monster you’re in the mood to hunt and help out a fellow player in need. There are always going to be some hunters in need of help with big monsters like Arkveld or Gore Magala, especially with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332">crossplay</a></span> set up, so you’re sure to get the materials you’re looking for.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This included the source code for the OG <em>Fallout</em>. Cain complied, which made it awkward when Interplay called a few years later asking if he had <em>Fallout’s </em>source code still. He thought it was a trap; turns out, Interplay had actually lost the code for it and <em>Fallout 2</em>. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928">Cain</a></span> had assumed that due to Interplay’s “destroy it all” policy, the source code for the old RPGs were lost and destroyed. Thankfully, that’s not the case. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 5, <em>Videogamer </em>reported</a></span> that it had heard from Interplay founder and game designer Rebecca Heineman that she had the source code for both <em>Fallout </em>and its sequel, as well as many other Interplay classics. She started preserving every Interplay game after working on the studio’s <em>10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection </em>and realizing how poorly the company’s past work was being saved for the future. </p><p> “I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs,” Heineman explained. “When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included <em>Fallout 1 </em>and <em>2.</em>” </p><p>Heineman confirmed to <em>Videogamer </em>that Cain’s comments about Interplay demanding all employees who leave the studio destroy all assets or face possible “litigation” in the future was true. She just didn’t follow those orders. And while she doesn’t have Caine’s lost and destroyed design docs and notes, she does have the source code for <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> safely secured on a high quality Blu-Ray disc.</p><p> “Interplay had a reputation of threatening ex-employees with litigation if they were ‘poached’, and if they had assets taken home,” she told the outlet. “However, they had no legal leg to stand on which was why a suit was never filed on anyone. [If] they did have a legal leg to stand on, I would have been sued into last week.”</p><p>As for why Heineman hasn’t released the code to the internet, she says that could only happen with permission from Bethesda (now the owners of <em>Fallout</em>) as they are still selling <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> today. </p><p>“I need expressed permission to release, despite the source code being pretty much obsolete,” said Heineman. “I [haven’t] gotten around to asking them. They are on my list.” She is a busy woman, working on bringing back MacPlay and porting more games to Mac. But hopefully, when she does ask, Bethesda is cool with her sharing these important pieces of game history online. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now that they’ve confessed their feelings and decided to live a life of mutual domesticity with a kid on the way, the reaction has been somewhat mixed. Like most criticism laid at the show’s feet, it has to do with how showrunner Craig Mazin has chosen to change the storyline up for the show compared to the game on which it’s based.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197551,197550" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Dina and Ellie’s relationship begins in much happier circumstances. This is before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-joel-death-abby-kills-reaction-1851777068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-joel-death-abby-kills-reaction-1851777068">Joel’s death at the hands of Abby</a></span>, and so it’s not heightened by the explosive life-or-death circumstances seen in the show. The two’s budding romance is pretty much conflict-free for the first several hours of the game. Dina is a ride-or-die, ready to help Ellie cross state lines for her revenge tour in Seattle, and most of their time together on the first day in the city is about getting to know each other better in this new romantic context. The first time there’s real tension between the girls is when Dina reveals that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Jesse’s baby. By this point, they’ve been traveling for weeks to reach the city, and Dina suspected she was pregnant for at least some of the trip. Ellie is furious at her for keeping this information from her, saying that they could have turned around and gotten her back home, going as far as to call her a “burden” in a fit of anger.</p><p>The two reconcile the next morning, but the scene illustrates how Ellie’s violent conquest is distorting everything else in her life. She’s concerned for Dina, but frustrated at how this development threatens to derail her revenge. Ellie comes off as boorish and dismissive of her girlfriend’s condition, and it stings hearing something so callous come out of her mouth in the heat of the moment. Compare that to the show’s take on this reveal:</p><p>Ellie is jazzed about being a parent in HBO’s version of the scene. Some fans similarly share the excitement of the mothers-to-be. Part of this is no doubt because viewers have been waiting for weeks for these two to seal the deal, but Ellie actor Bella Ramsey’s humorous “I’m gonna be a dad” line has become its own meme. It’s a sweet scene, and cuteness is enough to win over most people’s hearts.</p><p>But isn’t it all a little too perfect? That’s the argument some <em>Last of Us </em>fans are making, looking at the scenes side-by-side.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span> user tambor wrote, “I’m trying real hard to defend the show and understand their choices, but why is Ellie so joyous after Joel’s death?”</p><p>“I know everybody’s gonna love this change because it’s funny, but them removing all of the conflict and relationship development and combining it into one happy-go-lucky fairytale moment is annoying,” TikTok user char said in the comments.</p><p>“I didn’t like this change [because] it was one of the stepping stones of Ellie losing herself to revenge,” TikTok user Invader wrote. “I hope they can still flesh this out correctly.”</p></blockquote><p>Part of me reads this as another example of the show being scared to let its leads be unlikeable. The adaptation has taken a lot of the thornier aspects of the original story out to endear viewers to characters like Abby and Joel. The second season was forthcoming with Abby’s motivations, seemingly in an effort to help viewers warm up to her after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">ludicrous backlash</a></span> toward her when <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>launched. The show also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">bent over backwards to justify Joel’s violent actions</a></span> in season one, so this isn’t a recent tonal shift for HBO’s recreation. Ellie’s curt reaction to Dina’s pregnancy is hardly the most reprehensible thing she’ll do before she leaves Seattle, but if the show’s already pulling its punches on this, it doesn’t bode well for how down-and-dirty it’s going to be when things get much, much worse for our funky little lesbian.</p><p>If nothing else, the show needed a little bit of levity after the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-season-2-episode-joel-abby-death-reaction-1851777264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-season-2-episode-joel-abby-death-reaction-1851777264">brutal past couple of weeks</a></span>.
