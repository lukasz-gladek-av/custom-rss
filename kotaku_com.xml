              <p>Three days ago, I was talking about how sometimes good things happen, like HBO’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">bunk-ass live-action <em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series</a> looking&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-show-season-4-final-catherine-ohara-2000665018">likely to end in three seasons</a> rather than four. Well, the monkey’s paw didn’t just curl, it rolled in upon itself with an intensity great enough to open a portal to a much, much worse dimension. Craig Mazin, whio serves as showrunner on the post-apocalyptic adaptation, isn’t done at HBO; he’s now apparently working on a <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate</em></a> series that will continue the story of Larian Studios’ RPG. Just shoot me, HBO.</p> <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/">Deadline</a>&nbsp;</em>reports that Mazin is working alongside Hasbro to create a continuation of the&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;</em>story that will include both new characters and some returning ones from the game. You know, the ones whose fates you could have greatly influenced with your decisions in ways too drastic for the writers to have any wiggle room in making sweeping choices for them? I already don’t trust Mazin with characters when he’s following the source material’s script, much less continuing their stories beyond the credits. According to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>‘s story, Mazin has full creative control. Call me Gale Dekarios of Waterdeep the way I could explode right now.</p>

 <p>“After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created,” Mazin said in a statement to <em>Deadline</em>. “I am a devoted fan of <em>D&amp;D</em> and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can’t wait to help bring <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property.”</p> <p>Thanks, I hate it. And I’ll inevitably be putting my boxing gloves on once more to enter the ring when it comes out like I did for <em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch’s New Jetpack-Using Cat Hero Is An Agent Of Pure Chaos]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163</link>
            <guid>1427512</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I do not fear many things in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a><span>, but I am beginning to fear Jetpack Cat. The flying feline hero is exactly what she sounds like, a cat that has endless flight and zooms around the map healing allies and pestering foes. However, she also has the ability to tether her teammates to her craft and fly them around the battlefield. The strategies and combos players have already found in just a brief early access period are incredibly chaotic.</span></p> <p><span>I played a little bit of Jetpack Cat myself when I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>tried my hand at all five of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s new heroes last month</span></a><span>, and while I don’t think she will be joining my support hero rotation anytime soon, I’m already anticipating the ridiculous plays teams will pull off with her if they’re coordinating. The cat’s tether requires a teammate to opt in, meaning you don’t have to worry about any </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-hero-lifeweaver-season-4-patch-change-ptr-1850302565"><span>Lifeweaver-style trolling</span></a><span> or accidentally latching onto her and being taken for a ride.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re tethered, Jetpack Cat can fly you anywhere, as long as you don’t get shot down by the enemy team. But her tether isn’t limited to just teammates, it can also pick up things like Ashe’s Omnic ultimate B.O.B. as he fires down on the unsuspecting foes below, or D.Va’s mech suit after she’s set it to self destruct. This way you have a brief window to fix a bad play or placement. Meanwhile, Jetpack Cat’s ultimate lets her tether onto an enemy and drag them off the map or out of a fortified area, so you’re not just restricted to picking up friendlies. There’s a lot of potential and not a ton of limitations. Some early players have used dueling Jetpack Cats to pit two of their respective teammates against each other in an airborne battle.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">another funny clip from the frogger stream <a href="https://t.co/O9V4D28o24">https://t.co/O9V4D28o24</a> <a href="https://t.co/vbSkuGZ7Yd">pic.twitter.com/vbSkuGZ7Yd</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2019174652342595621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FROGGER HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO THE CAT <a href="https://t.co/dfRVcY7chp">pic.twitter.com/dfRVcY7chp</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2019142721617998175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ko" dir="ltr">신캐로 암살 야무지게 하시는데; <a href="https://t.co/3QOyiCnRgy">pic.twitter.com/3QOyiCnRgy</a></p> <p>— 진 (@nojamgirl_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nojamgirl_/status/2019190825696240049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">■新サポート<br>「ジェットパックキャット」</p> <p>無制限に浮游＆味方を引っ張れる模様👀</p> <p>🎬:SEjFiNN <a href="https://t.co/rliVJC8Ukj">pic.twitter.com/rliVJC8Ukj</a></p> <p>— Overwatch2ニュース@おばにゅー (@Overwatch2_NEWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Overwatch2_NEWS/status/2019122454837563574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">never in my life did i expect to see a mauga and bastion duking it out in the skybox of illios lighthouse LMAOO <a href="https://twitter.com/zbra_ow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zbra_ow</a> <a href="https://t.co/4i8zposR3c">pic.twitter.com/4i8zposR3c</a></p> <p>— lightt (@ow_lightt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ow_lightt/status/2019180084297650584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Jetpack Cat is joining the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>roster on February 10 as the game undergoes a bit of a revamp, restructuring its seasonal rollout to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>incorporate lore</span></a><span> and releasing a total of 10 heroes across the next year.</span></p>
