              <p>We’re just days away from Big Prime Deals Day over at Amazon. This is a multi-day sales event put on during the slower purchasing months to help kickstart some sales. That means if you’ve been patient, waiting for the right moment to buy that espresso maker or bidet you’d been eyeing, next week on October 7 and October 9 might be the best time to pull the trigger. And yet, even though it’s not officially here yet, some items have already begun dropping in price. Take this mini PC for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">You can get the AceMagic mini PC right now for 25% off. It’s normally going for $200, so you’ll save a good $50 as it comes to just $150 for a limited time.</a></p>

<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have that large of a living space, like if you live with roommates or just have&nbsp; one bedroom or studio in an expensive city, you probably consider what little space you have to be precious. You may not want to take up your entire desk with a massive PC tower. A mini PC offers versatility while keeping the footprint small.</p>
<p>Lots of modern TVs already have built-in smart features, allowing you to download app like Netflix and Hulu directly to them. And if your happens not to be one of those, streaming sticks like the Fire TV and Roku are pretty cheap to come by. That all may be the case, but there are still reason to power your home theater with a mini PC instead. They are full-on Windows devices after all. That means you’d have a wider range of compatibility, playing various video formats and even playing locally saved media. And the small form factor is easy enough to keep hidden behind your TV or within its stand.</p>
<p>Mini PCs also make for wonderful PLEX servers which means you can access your media files anywhere you are. Some gamers tend to flock toward mini PCs are they are the perfect emulation machine for retro games given the minimal amount of processing power they require. Now if you are choosing to do that, be sure it’s only for storing ROMs of games you already happen to legally own. I won’t be personally checking, so you don’t have to pinky swear me anything.</p>



<h2>Specs on Specs on Specs</h2>
<p>This mini PC from AceMagic is equipped with the 2025 Twin Lake N150 processor along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It’s pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro and has multiple USB ports to connect to your peripherals.</p>

              <p>Xbox is reportedly close to announcing a new ad-supported version of its game streaming service. Apparently, Microsoft has been internally testing ad-supported cloud streaming with employees, letting them play games without a <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">Game Pass</a> subscription.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">On October 3,<em> The Verge</em> reported</a> that sources familiar with Microsoft’s future plans have confirmed with the outlet that the tech giant will soon announce a new way to stream Xbox games without a Game Pass subscription. Currently, you need a Game Pass subscription to stream Xbox games. This new free streaming option will reportedly feature pre-roll ads that will appear before playing a game.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Xbox about this report.</p> <p><em>The Verge</em> further reports that sources with knowledge of the internal testing of the service say these ads are about two minutes long. There’s also a limit of one hour per session and about five hours max a month, though this might change if and when the service is rolled out to the public. It sounds like this upcoming free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will let folks stream some games you already own, some other select eligible games, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-retro-classics-app-activision-blizzard-games-free-1851781736">retro titles</a>.</p>

 <p>This new ad-supported free streaming option will be available on Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. Reportedly, Microsoft is planning to test out this new option via a public beta. A full rollout of the service will happen in the months that follow.</p> <p>It’s been a not-so-great week for Xbox Game Pass. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">On Wednesday</a>, Xbox announced a massive price increase for all tiers of Xbox Game Pass while also completely reorganizing and renaming parts of the popular subscription service. In doing so, Xbox made everything a bit worse and more expensive. The gaming giant also quietly announced that, unlike all other Xbox first-party games, future <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483"><em>Call of Duty</em> games would not migrate to Game Pass Standard within a year of launch</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">This all follows in the wake of Xbox raising the price of its consoles last month</a>, which was&nbsp;the second Xbox console price hike to happen in 2025.</p>
