In November you could battle Snoop Dogg and Eminem while sporting a brand new pair of Nikes on your amorphous blob-creature. It’s a corporate soup of cameos and crossovers which, viewed from the outside, can appear rather gross. And now, Mariah Carey of all people might be getting in the mix?</p><p>I’m a recent convert to <em>Fortnite</em>, drawn in by my 10-year-old, having made the lazy (but understandable) mistake of thinking it just a cacophony of cartoonish noise. It turns out, beneath the corporate tie-ins and embarrassing celebrity endorsements, it’s one hell of a solid online shooter. I thoroughly enjoy playing, ideally in Duos with the boy, but spend a lot of time playing solo too. Thanks to some superb, parkourish movement (made even better in this latest season with wall-scrambling, roly-poly landings and samurai-sword-induced double-jumps), excellent gun fighting, and a vast variety in approaches, I’ve found my groove.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the corporate nonsense grates <em>less</em>, but once through the looking glass you can at least appreciate why people put up with it. And...sometimes it’s fun?</p><p>Given that November’s shorter so-called “Remix” season (which brought back season 2's map and dreary weapons) featured Snoop, Ice Spice, Eminem and Juice Wrld, the idea that Mariah Carey might be hiding in a vast block of ice (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as she apparently so often does</a></span>) doesn’t seem very far-fetched. Heck, at the end of Remix, there was a (stunning) slightly interactive event in which an Ice Spice the size of a skyscraper performed a gig in New York City, while titanic Eminems fought one another and a Juice Wrld as big as the solar system sang as players jumped around the rings of Saturn. It’s tough to rule anything out after that.</p><p>Anyhoo, that’s what the leakers are saying is due to happen in just a couple of days:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first trailer gives us a glimpse of all of the comic book character’s staples—the Kent farm, the Daily Planet, and Lois Lane—as well as elements that haven’t had the Hollywood treatment before like Krypto the Superdog.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Superman arrives in theaters July 11, 2025 as the first movie in a reboot of the DC cinematic universe, following the bold, contentious, and ultimately ill-fated Zack Snyder <em>Justice League </em>movies. <em>Superman</em> 2025 puts David Corenswet in the red boots of the titular Kryptonian and looks like it will stake out a new origin story for the comic book heroes’ onscreen persona, as well as move his long legacy forward. </p><p>The trailer has a lot going on in, despite just being the initial teaser. Here’s a look:</p><p>It begins with flashbacks to Superman’s life as Clark Kent, as he bleeds out on the arctic snow only to eventually be rescued by Krypto. We get glimpses of Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, and Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan Kent, as well as plenty of slow-motion action shots and some borderline overly sentimental shots; like a kid raising a Superman flag amid a local humanitarian crisis, and an indistinct mob of Metropolis citizens booing and cajoling Superman as he walks into a building. </p><p><em>Superman</em> 2025 won’t just be about the superpowered alien adapting to life on his new home planet, though. It’s also set to include include appearances by Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, and Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, who appears for a split second in the trailer with one of the goofiest wigs I’ve ever seen. No idea how writer and director Gunn expects to fit all of that into one movie with a sub-three hour runtime, but here we are.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
