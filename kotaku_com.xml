And now this comic book fighter is hopping to a new platform.</p><p>On April 29, after plenty of rumors and fan speculation, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/eGDSf2PHJ40&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/eGDSf2PHJ40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kablam announced that <em>Marvel Contest of Champions</em> was officially coming to Steam</a></span>. This new PC port of the fighting game will feature improved HD visuals running at 60FPS as well as an “overhauled UI.” The PC port also supports both keyboard and controllers with fully remappable controls.</p><p>The devs say <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127280/Marvel_Contest_of_Champions/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127280/Marvel_Contest_of_Champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Contest of Champions</em> on PC</a></span> will receive monthly updates and events just like the mobile version, which makes sense as both versions support crossplay and cross-progression. So you should be able to kick some butt on your bus ride home and then get a few more fights in on your PC without missing a beat. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://playcontestofchampions.com/pc-pre-reg/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=pr-na&amp;utm_campaign=pc-prereg&amp;utm_content=pc-pre-reg-announce-release&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://playcontestofchampions.com/pc-pre-reg/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=pr-na&amp;utm_campaign=pc-prereg&amp;utm_content=pc-pre-reg-announce-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kablam is letting players pre-register</a></span> now ahead of the game’s release on PC. Doing so via the official website will unlock new gear and items when <em>Contest of Champion</em>s launches on PC. The company has yet to provide a specific date for when that will happen, but it sounds like fans won’t have to wait long to start punching Spider-Man, Mr. Fantastic, the Hulk and other heroes on Steam. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As exciting as it is for Sony fans to finally get a chance to dive into this exciting open-world racing series, it’s fair to wonder if these new players will be able to play with folks who have the game on other platforms.

So, regardless of which platform you opt to play the game on, you’ll be able to join convoys and hang out with your friends so you can blaze through Mexico together.</p><p>Additionally, <strong><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s leaderboards are universal</strong>, meaning you’ll be able to compete with others to see who comes out on top.

But it sure is fun as hell anyway.</p><h2 id="h1806"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> have cross-progression?</h2><p>Unfortunately, things fare worse for those hoping for cross-progression in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>. <strong>The game does not support cross-save features</strong>.Any progress you’ve made on other platforms can not be transferred to another. In other words, if you’ve already made a lot of headway on Xbox or PC, picking the game up on PS5 means you’ll have to begin your Horizon journey anew. </p><p>It’s a bummer that existing players can’t make the jump over to PS5 without having to start over, but at least this exciting racing experience is finally available to a whole new community. For those checking out the game on PS5, you’re in for a treat! </p><hr><p><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is available now on Xbox Series X/S and Windows PC, with the PS5 version launching on April 29. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
