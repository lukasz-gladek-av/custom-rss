But he has life goals that supersede fighting CGI aliens. “When I have kids, you will not see me in movies anymore,” he says. “Golf and dad. And I will just disappear off the face of the earth.”</p><p>He doesn’t give any timeline for when he’ll become a father (who really does?), and he’s already locked in to appear in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-best-movies-oppenheimer-inception-1851708632&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-best-movies-oppenheimer-inception-1851708632">Christopher Nolan</a></span>’s upcoming film <em>The Odyssey, </em>the next <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spider-man-4-avengers-doomsday-tom-holland-release-date-1851681957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-4-avengers-doomsday-tom-holland-release-date-1851681957"><em>Spider-Man </em>flick</a></span>, and the fact-based racing drama <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/11/amazon-mgm-studios-american-speed-tom-holland-austin-butler-1236164155/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/amazon-mgm-studios-american-speed-tom-holland-austin-butler-1236164155/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>American Speed</em></a></span><em>, </em>all set to be released in 2026. That could make 2026 as good a time as any for a swan song. </p><p>Time has also begun showing its effects on the actor, who <em>Spider-Man </em>director Jon Watts says once did a full standing backflip in his audition for the superhero role that changed his life. Holland says he successfully did the same backflip recently, but this time he pulled every muscle in his stomach and “could not laugh because my stomach was so sore” for weeks. That sort of pain is enough to make anyone rethink their career. </p><p>As one of the most important superhero actors of a generation nears the age of 30, it might be a good time to binge your favorite Holland films before there’s no more to go around. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike previous events, however, this one will lock some of its best rewards behind a paid event pass. Think of it as a battle pass within a battle pass, on top of an already $70 game.

Outside of shop bundles, previous crossovers for <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Dune</em> let players earn rewards simply by playing.
