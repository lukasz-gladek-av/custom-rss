              <p>Electronic Arts revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">it‚Äôs planning to add a college basketball game</a> to its ever-expanding roster of sports franchises. Then 2K Games came out hours later and indicated <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967">it was doing the same</a>. Now new reporting suggests both publishers have been at war behind the scenes trying to lock up the deals needed to make an NCAA basketball game a reality.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag/"><em>Sports Business Journal </em>reports</a> that while EA won a bidding round earlier this year with the Collegiate Licensing Company for the rights to the NCAA brand, 2K Games has moved forward with its own college basketball game by trying to negotiate brand partnerships with individual colleges like UCLA.</p> <p><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúUCLA Athletics and UCLA Trademarks &amp; Licensing, an enterprise of the </span><span data-testid="content-text">Associated Students UCLA</span><span data-testid="content-text">, have announced a long-term collaboration with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text">2K</span><span data-testid="content-text"> which will see the UCLA Men‚Äôs and Women‚Äôs Basketball programs bring the rich legacy of Bruins basketball to a future project,‚Äù the school <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/basketball/ucla-men-s-and-women-s-basketball-confirmed-for-2k-college-basketball-project">announced on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

According to <em>Sports Business Journal</em>, it wanted the rights to everything in NCAA divisional basketball on both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs leagues, which would give it the sort of exclusivity stranglehold it long had with the NFL in its <em>Madden</em> series. And if EA doesn‚Äôt get its way, sources told <em>Sports Business Journal</em> the publisher might abandon the upcoming game altogether.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe opportunity that‚Äôs excited us in college basketball is to deliver a full, standalone experience that captures everything that makes the sport so special,‚Äù EA Sports VP Sean O‚ÄôBrien told <em>SBJ</em> in a statement. ‚ÄúThe approach we‚Äôve proposed is to create a game that includes all 350-plus NCAA Division I schools‚Äîboth men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams included‚Äîwith name, image and likeness compensation for all athletes, 32 conferences, the NCAA and all things that make ‚ÄòMarch Madness‚Äô the most exciting month of sports and all the traditions and pageantry fans love.‚Äù</p>

 <p>Basically, 2K Games, which was reportedly part of the NCAA bidding war but lost to EA, has decided to move ahead with a college basketball game regardless. While it abandoned its<em> Hoops</em> franchise over a decade ago, it‚Äôs been releasing<em> NBA2K</em> every year and could quickly spin off a new version of it for college teams or, as <em>SBJ</em> reports, possibly position it as an add-on or expansion for the existing franchise.</p> <p>EA, which also abandoned its basketball franchise over a decade ago, will have to start from scratch. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2025/08/26/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game/85645694007/">Recent reporting</a> suggests a new game would be years away at best and possibly <a href="https://x.com/ChrisVannini/status/1939704916269818312">not arrive until 2028 or later</a>. Unless it can get the NCAA and its member schools to pull the plug on 2K‚Äôs game, it‚Äôll be coming in late. A big part of what helped <em>EA Sports College Football</em> explode in popularity last year was years of pent-up demand. Now both publishers are in a race to see who can cash in on the latest untapped market for annual sports games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love it when a game comes out of nowhere and surprises me. Earlier this month, that is exactly what happened when I saw the trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460"><em>VoidBreaker</em> during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. I downloaded the fast-paced sci-fi roguelike FPS shortly after seeing it, and not only is it good, but it might be one of the best shooters I‚Äôve played all year. And it was made almost entirely by one guy, Daniel Stubbington.</p> <p><em>VoidBreaker</em> is an incredibly fast and sleek first-person shooter available now in early access on Steam and Game Pass PC. The game is set inside a large, highly advanced AI program that is using human test subjects to gather data on combat and warfare. This involves you endlessly fighting and dying over and over again through ‚Äúruns‚Äù of the program‚Äôs randomly generated gauntlets filled with various robotic enemies and other odd cyber-opponents. Luckily, very early on, a previous human who was trying to escape the program contacts you to help take the AI down and get out alive. Sadly, your ally is just the digital remains of a very dead person who has a skeleton hiding in your cyberjail‚Äôs basement. But while he‚Äôs dead, his mind is still in the program and helps you hack the system, slowly unlocking permanent bonuses and new weapons to help you get further during each action-filled run.</p> <p>If some of that sounds silly, it is! And that‚Äôs the point. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-pacman-silent-hill-hollow-void-2000619570"><em>VoidBreaker</em></a> leans into the absurd and strange situation you find yourself in, with plentiful jokes delivered by a dry robot announcer during runs. Messages include the program explaining how living forever in pain is better than dying, and how you aren‚Äôt alone because the AI is always watching you. It strikes that perfect balance between silly and dark that <em>Portal</em> nailed so many years ago.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="VOID/BREAKER | Launch Trailer | PC Game Pass" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44fxNXBOvIQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>Another run, another run, another run‚Ä¶.</h2> <p>The gameplay loop of <em>VoidBreaker</em> will feel pretty familiar if you‚Äôve played <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadzone-rogue-roguelike-steam-pc-shooter-destiny-2000617173">any roguelike game</a> in the last few years. Each run feels different, as enemy encounters and other sections of the digital gauntlets are randomly generated. As you progress through these runs, you find mods of various rarity levels that give you new abilities, make you stronger or faster, or even change how your gun works. And of course, as in most roguelikes, there‚Äôs a currency you earn that can only be used at shops that randomly appear on your path during that run. There‚Äôs also a currency that lets you unlock permanent upgrades in the aforementioned secret dead guy basement.</p> <p>So yeah, nothing groundbreaking in <em>Voidbreaker</em>. Instead, the reason to play this new FPS is for the gameplay and combat. Movement in <em>VoidBreaker</em> is incredibly smooth, snappy, and satisfying. This is the kind of game where it‚Äôs just fun to run around and jump, even outside of a fight. And gunplay is equally fantastic, with the assault rifle you unlock fairly early into the game being a loud and hectic death machine that sprays enemies with bullets in a way that always makes me happy. Buildings and other structures you spot in the levels can also be <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">destroyed √† la <em>Battlefield</em> and crumble upon enemies</a>, stunning or even killing them. Oh, and you can pick up most items using a <em>Half-Life</em>-like Gravity Gun mechanic and fling them back at baddies, too.</p>

 <p>As you upgrade your character during runs, adding ice bullets, improving your Gravity-Gun-thingy, unlocking fire attacks, and collecting super-powerful grenade mods, the action in <em>VoidBreaker</em> can become extremely chaotic. At times, it became nearly too much for my eyes to keep track of as my rifle spat out electrically charged bullets covered in energy fields, buildings collapsed around me, and enemies filled the arena with various red projectiles that can do a lot of damage if you aren‚Äôt careful. It can be a lot, and I think for some it might be too much. But I enjoyed every moment of it, even if there were definitely times when I was just spamming my abilities and grenades toward a massive cloud of destruction and death and hoping for the best.</p> <p>But the chaos is part of the fun, and death isn‚Äôt that big of a deal in <em>VoidBreaker</em>. After all, it just gave me another excuse to load back up in my weird, sparse cyber apartment/prison and quickly say hi to the skeleton in the basement before hopping back out for one more run. I‚Äôm excited to see how the game expands in early access. Now, I need to go and play more <em>VoidBreaker</em>. Just one more run. I‚Äôll go to bed eventually. It‚Äôs only 2 a.m‚Ä¶.</p>
