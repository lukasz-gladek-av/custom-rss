            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Roblox Corporation just revealed its new “real-time, action conditioned world model,” a generative AI tool for producing interactable videos that seems to work </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227"><span>exactly like Google’s Project Genie</span></a><span>, which launched last week. While that one was able to rip off <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, the Roblox version is plagiarizing 2025’s Game of the Year.</span></p> <p><span>“We see several immediate uses for our Roblox world model,” the company announced on February 5. “We will use it side-by-side text, image and video prompts as a way to launch auto-generation of immersive worlds. In Roblox Studio, a creator could walk around and use prompts to ‘paint’ a world and then convert it into a 3D representation or direct to Roblox native as a way for many people to play simultaneously.”&nbsp;</span><span>It then proceeded to show a really ugly-looking version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> as proof.</p>

 <p><span>The strangest part of the entire reveal is that the world model tech that the Roblox Corporation decided to show off was actually an addendum to a completely separate reveal. The real announcement here is the impending release of their “</span><a href="https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/02/accelerating-creation-powered-roblox-cube-foundation-model"><span>4D generation</span></a><span>” tech, a feature for the Cube Foundation Model that allows “creators and players to generate fully functional objects” that can be ported into </span><span>Roblox</span><span>, the platform its billions of users actually play on and spend money in.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we supposed to pretend that isnt expedition 33 or are we selling that ai generation is theft on purpose?</p> <p>— Mjl8 (@xMJL8x) <a href="https://twitter.com/xMJL8x/status/2019496403471311281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The genAI world model addendum was featured </span><a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/2019221626387312810?s=20"><span>in a reply</span></a><span> made by the official Roblox X account to its 4D generation announcement, which explained that the “real-time, action conditioned world model” has been “trained on a combination of data, including proprietary Roblox 3D avatar/world interaction data.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The “including” part of the message here is clearly attempting to do a lot of heavy lifting, because everyone immediately noticed that the “woman in a glowing cave” prompt had unmistakably used footage of Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>to generate its “real-time dreaming” world.</span></p>

 <p><span>As one user very handily </span><a href="https://x.com/josephioanna/status/2019449659337458057?s=20"><span>pointed out</span></a><span> in their reply, it seems to have specifically used the Flying Waters location as inspiration, as well as Maelle’s model (including her outfit). “What do @SandfallGames think about this? I wonder what you trained your model on?”</span></p> <p><span>Sandfall Interactive has yet to make an official statement regarding Roblox Corporation’s world generation showcase. However, Nintendo hasn’t weighed in on Project Genie’s use of its assets and IPs either. That’s despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>a drop in Nintendo’s share value</span></a><span> on January 30 that some analysts have directly attributed to Project Genie’s release.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched over a decade ago on Xbox 360 and PS3 in September 2013.</a> And its sequel, the highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, is seemingly, finally, actually, for real, launching this November. Take-Two’s CEO is even promising that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">game’s marketing will kick off this summer</a>.</p> <p>So, as we wait for that and hope the game doesn’t get delayed again, let’s look back at the complete timeline for<em> GTA V</em>‘s marketing and promotion, from announcement to release.</p> <h2>2011</h2> <p><em>GTA V</em> was officially announced on October 25, 2011, <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/128788090969001984">via a simple little tweet</a> that just said “#GTAV.” People went wild at the time as the last main installment in the series, <em>GTA IV</em>, had been released in 2008. Can you imagine waiting possibly four years for a <em>GTA</em> sequel?!?!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666176">©Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One week later, on November 2, Rockstar released the <a href="https://youtu.be/QkkoHAzjnUs">first trailer for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>.</a> It featured narration by one of the game’s main characters, Michael, and showed beauty shots of Los Santos and the surrounding area. Young Zack watched this trailer way too many times. It ended without a release date. Then…nothing. Radio silence from Rockstar. The more things change…</p> <h2>2012</h2> <p>In July 2012, as part of a Rockstar Newswire post answering fan questions, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">Rockstar released two new screenshots of </a><em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">GTA V</a>.</em> They didn’t feature any main characters, but offered two new looks at the then-upcoming open-world game. Once again, a lot of <em>GTA</em> fans went wild over these crumbs.</p>

 <p>In August 2012, <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/Screenshots#:~:text=In%20August%202012,%5B5%5D">Rockstar teased fans with 10 more screenshots</a> released across three different posts throughout the month. The company also promised that more was coming in the near future. But fans would have to wait a little bit longer than planned.</p>

 <p>Rockstar planned to release a second trailer for <em>GTA V</em> on November 2. However, these plans were derailed when <a href="https://kotaku.com/hurricane-sandy-delays-second-gta-v-trailer-5957385">Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York City</a>, where Rockstar’s main HQ is located, and knocked out the power. The trailer would eventually be released 12 days later on November 14. It featured the excellent song “Skeletons” by Stevie Wonder, a song I can’t hear without thinking about this trailer.</p>  <p>In October, a year after the game was announced, Rockstar confirmed a leaked release date of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/27/gta-v-coming-spring-2013">“Spring 2013” for the game</a>. In November, it started taking pre-orders for <em>GTA V</em>. Before 2012 ended, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav"><em>Game Informer</em> ran a large cover story about </a><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a>,</em> detailing a hands-off demo they were shown and revealing some other details about the game.</p>

 <h2>Early 2013</h2> <p>Rockstar kicked off the new year with bad news. On January 31, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/31/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-a-september-release-date">Rockstar Games announced that <em>GTA V</em> had been delayed</a> from Spring 2013 to September 17, 2013.</p> <p>“To all <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> fans, please accept our apologies for the delay, and our promise that the entire team here is working very hard to make the game all it can be. We are doing all we can to help ensure it will meet, if not exceed, your expectations come September – we thank you for your support and patience,” posted Rockstar at the time.</p> <p>A few months later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406024311/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/04/new-mural-could-reveal-grand-theft-auto-v-box-art/">in April, Rockstar revealed the game’s official cover</a> via a mural painted on the side of a building in New York City. Later that same month, Rockstar Games released not one, not two, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/27/ign-live-presents-gta-5-character-trailers">three different trailers</a>. Each trailer focused on one of the three playable protagonists in the game. Younger Zack lost his shit that day, let me tell you. Rockstar would once more enter radio silence mode, but this would be the last time before an onslaught of marketing and promotion kicked off.</p>

 <h2>Summer 2013</h2> <p>On July 9, Rockstar finally shared actual gameplay of <em>GTA V</em> as part of a gameplay overview trailer. This was the first time most people had ever seen the game running on actual hardware, and it was wild to witness. I remember being shocked at how good it looked. Even today, all these years later, I still think the original version of<em> GTA</em> <em>V </em>and <em>GTA Online</em> look pretty dang good.</p>  <p><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/519075-new-epsilon-program-twitter-found/">Also in July, a viral marketing campaign began using an old <em>GTA San Andreas-</em>era website</a> mocking Scientology and cults. This would end up leading players to a fake Twitter account for the Epsilon Cult and would end with a way to audition to be in the game. <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-5-6-casting-fans-epsilon-program/#:~:text=In%20the%20lead,the%20Epsilon%20Program.">Five people were picked and digitally added to <em>GTA V.</em></a></p>

 <p>Between August 13 and September 13, Rockstar began posting blogs on its website sharing even more details about <em>GTA V’</em>s world and characters, as well as new screenshots. The floodgates were truly open at this point.</p> <p>On August 15, <a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A">Rockstar released a gameplay overview showing off our first look at</a><em><a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A"> GTA Online</a>.</em> Looking back at it now, it is clear that Rockstar had no idea what this game would evolve into over the next decade. It looks so quaint now.</p>  <p>And finally, on August 29, 2013, just over two weeks before the launch of <em>GTA V</em> on Xbox and PlayStation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep5QfWMba-s">Rockstar released the final pre-release trailer for the game</a>. This was a shorter trailer and would end up being played on TV as <em>GTA V’</em>s launch commercial. If you were watching cable back around 2013, you likely saw this ad a few dozen times or more.</p>

 <p>That ends the marketing timeline for<em> GTA V.</em> Of course, the game would go on to be ported to many more platforms, get many more trailers, and spawn <em>GTA Online,</em> one of the most successful live-service games ever made. And it all started with a tweet in 2011.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Charger Falls to Deep Clearance on Amazon, Works With Original Switch and Steam Deck]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-falls-to-deep-clearance-on-amazon-works-with-original-switch-and-steam-deck-2000666168</link>
            <guid>1427932</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is, by design, made to be taken on the go. But there’s a risk to bringing it along on road trips, flights, hotel stays, or any other form of travel — and not the one you think. That 60W Nintendo charger that comes with the Switch 2 and powers both the console and its TV dock can be&nbsp;<em>really</em> hard to replace if you break or lose it. Amazon’s offering a great deal on a rare find — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7072/">a third-party 60W fast charger that works with the Switch 2 and its dock, along with other handheld gaming consoles, for just $20</a>.</p>
<p>KOVA’s fast charger comes with a detachable 5-foot cable, with options also available for 3.3-foot, 6.6-foot, and 10-foot versions. The wall box is identical in size to the original Nintendo version, and it matches the original in speedy charging time. Many of the other third-party chargers on the market are either not compatible with the Switch 2, or are copies of the original 39W charger for the Switch 1, which charges at a far slower rate and is incompatible with the Switch 2 Dock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7072/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Stable, and Safe</h2>
<p>The KOVA Switch 2 charger has a built-in AI chip that protects your handheld console from overheating, over-currents and short-circuits, and other potential electrical mayhem that could otherwise fry your device. With the 60W fast charger in place, the Switch 2 can go from a completely dead battery to full charge in just 2.5 hours, and you can play while it’s plugged in.</p>
<p>One of the truly hard-to-find features of a third-party Switch 2 charger is full compatibility with the Dock. Some of those chargers don’t provide enough juice for the Dock to connect with your TV, and some work only with lower-res screens. When the KOVA Switch 2 charger is connected to the Switch 2 Dock, it creates a strong and stable power source that allows for a seamless connection between the console and your TV — 4K screens included.</p>



<h2>Power Sharing</h2>
<p>This charger’s bona fides for charging the Switch 2 and Switch 2 Dock are well established, but the KOVA Switch 2 charger is also retro-compatible with the original Nintendo Switch and its Dock. It’s also compatible with the Steam Deck, and with the reinforced cable rated for over 350,000 bends in its lifetime, it might outlast your console itself.</p>
<p>Finding yourself with a dead Switch 2 because you’ve lost or broken its charger stinks. Avoiding that fate for <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7072/">just $20 at Amazon when you buy the KOVA Switch 2 charger</a> is a small and exceptionally worthy investment.</p>
