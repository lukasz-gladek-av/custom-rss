              <p>OLED gaming monitors used to mean choosing between your rent money and screen quality, but that gap keeps shrinking: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/">LG’s 32-inch Ultragear just hit $876 on Amazon, dropping $523 from its $1,399 list price</a> to reach an all-time low right before the holidays. This isn’t some Black Friday leftover either, as <strong>Amazon guarantees delivery before Christmas if you order soon</strong>.</p>
<p>The combination of <strong>4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, 0.03ms response time and true OLED blacks</strong> makes this monitor work equally well for competitive gaming sessions and those movie nights when you want visuals that actually impress.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6485/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Flexibility Really Means Something Useful</h2>
<p>The Dual Mode feature is more important than most marketing fluff because it really changes how you use the monitor every day: When you’re playing open-world games or story-driven games where graphics quality is more important than quick reactions, <strong>switch to 4K at 240Hz</strong>. When you’re playing competitive shooters, MOBAs, or racing games where every millisecond counts and clarity isn’t as important as responsiveness,<strong> use a hotkey to switch to Full HD at 480Hz</strong>. That 480Hz mode isn’t just a number on a spec sheet: it really does make motion blur almost invisible when you pan the camera quickly or flick it quickly.</p>



<p>The<strong> 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time</strong> gets rid of ghosting and trailing that slower panels have, which is especially noticeable during dark scenes or when characters move quickly. This speed is possible because OLED technology lets each pixel turn on and off right away, instead of waiting for liquid crystals to twist like LCD panels do. You’ll be able to see enemies coming out of the shadows faster, follow moving targets more accurately, and play the game in a way that feels like it’s connected to your inputs instead of lagging behind them.</p>



<p>LG added Micro Lens Array+ technology to this Ultragear which boosts<strong> normal brightness to 275 nits and peak brightness to 1300 nits</strong> which makes it the brightest OLED gaming display in their lineup. That brightness is more important than you might think, because OLED monitors can have trouble in bright rooms but this panel does well against window glare and overhead lights. The VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification means that the monitor meets strict industry standards for both brightness peaks and the very deep blacks that OLED displays are known for. The 1.5 million to 1 contrast ratio gives images depth that LCD monitors can’t match. It shows details in dark game scenes that would be lost in murky gray on lower-quality displays.</p>
<p>The a<strong>nti-glare coating</strong> cuts down on reflections without adding that annoying grainy texture that some matte screens have which means you can focus on the game instead of having to change the lighting in your room all the time. The built-in speakers make surprisingly punchy bass-driven sound that works for casual gaming and streaming without needing external speakers.</p>
<p>The LG Switch app turns the monitor into a productivity powerhouse between gaming sessions by letting you split the screen into up to six customizable sections for doing more than one thing at a time. You can manage video calls, look through documents, and keep an eye on chat windows all at the same time. You can also switch between your PC input and the built-in webOS streaming platform for Netflix and YouTube without having to touch your computer.<strong> DisplayPort 2.1 and USB Type-C connections</strong> make sure your setup will work with next-generation graphics cards and give you enough bandwidth to push 4K at 240Hz without compression.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: In a market where similar specs usually cost $1,200 to $1,500, $876 for a 32-inch OLED gaming monitor with dual refresh modes, HDR 400 certification, and sub-millisecond response times is a great deal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After comments this week from Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealing that the </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> developer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>using generative AI in its workflow</span></a><span> prompted a massive backlash on social media, several developers have been weighing in. While Vincke said most of Larian’s workers were “okay” with how the team had integrated the technology, the public outcry </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934"><span>from fans and developers</span></a><span> told a different story. The latest games industry veterans to weigh in include </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> lead Daniel Vávra and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-co-directors-new-game-couldnt-be-more-different-2000653042"><span>ex-Naughty Dog director Bruce Straley</span></a><span>, and both of them seem to think generative AI is here to stay in game development, though one of them is at least standing firm against the trend for now.</span></p> <p><span>Vávra posted a lengthy response to Vincke’s statements </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169"><span>on X</span></a><span>, saying that while he’s “no fan of of AI generated art,” detractors need to “face [the] reality” that it’s here to stay.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>You know what I hate most about making games? The fact that it takes 7 years and 300 people and tens of millions of dollars to make. And the fact that Tom had to spend 500 hours in the studio recording completely generic heckling and generic bars.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I’m all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won’t have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they’ll have to focus on the essentials.</span></p> <p><span>I have ideas for lots of games, but I’m fifty years old and so far it’s taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I’m all for it.</span></p></blockquote> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LarAtLarian</a>  said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy shitstorm. </p> <p>I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2. I don't… <a href="https://t.co/l7pNbTxeIT">https://t.co/l7pNbTxeIT</a></p> <p>— Daniel Vávra ⚔ (@DanielVavra) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Vávra goes on to raise a bunch of hypotheticals about being able to ask NPCs anything and the technology generating appropriate answers and so forth, as if human writers can’t generate something more interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Straley, meanwhile, also believes that generative AI is here to stay, but </span><a href="https://x.com/bruce_straley/status/2001390353262457071?s=20"><span>says that he’s taken a stance against it</span></a><span> at Wildflower Interactive, though he admits that he might not be able to do so forever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We don’t need AI,” Straley said in an interview with </span><i><span>Kinda Funny</span></i><span>. “I really do think it’s the demise of the human species. Our brain…we need a frontal lobe. Hundreds of thousands of years of this supercomputer that’s built, and they’re making football fields and draining water supplies, etc. to try to replicate something that a human can already do. It just doesn’t make sense to me.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is AI needed in gaming? Bruce Straley (Co-Director of TLOU) gives his thoughts. <a href="https://t.co/msJdOS9Rlm">pic.twitter.com/msJdOS9Rlm</a></p> <p>— Kinda Funny (@KindaFunnyVids) <a href="https://twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids/status/2001337156812296647?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>It’s nice to hear someone like Straley taking a stance against using generative AI, though it is disheartening to hear that he also thinks it’s an inevitability that it will stay in the industry. Vávra says that “absolutely everyone else is” using generative AI in some capacity in game development, and if that’s true now, it doesn’t have to be. You can want better for your creative medium than plagiarizing slop machines that leave talented people out of work. If believing that bad things don’t have to happen is foolish, then I’d rather be a fool than an AI shill. </span></p>

<h2 data-start="384" data-end="408"><strong data-start="384" data-end="408">Everyday Performance</strong></h2>
<p data-start="410" data-end="999">The 15.3-inch 2025 MacBook Air continues to be a top pick for users who value portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 3.3 pounds and maintaining a sleek, slim design, this model upholds the Air’s tradition of ultra-light form while delivering performance on par with larger devices.

On the sides, there are two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and peripheral connectivity. The MagSafe charging port ensures your power cable remains securely attached but detaches safely if pulled. Apple has also kept the headphone jack—great for anyone who still prefers wired audio devices.</p>
<p data-start="2224" data-end="2430">For those fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air offers seamless features like AirDrop, iMessage syncing, and Handoff, allowing for smooth transitions between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p data-start="2432" data-end="2790"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/">The MacBook Air is available in several configurations, all of which are currently discounted. The 256GB model, priced at $949, offers a $250 savings</a>. The 512GB model is priced at $1,149, also reflecting a $250 reduction. For those needing more memory, the 24GB RAM and 512GB storage configuration has dropped by $250, bringing it down to $1,349 from $1,599.</p>
