              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is adding several new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> when it comes to the Switch systems on October 16. We already knew Dragonite was getting one of these powerful alternate forms, and now another monster from the series’ first generation is getting an upgrade almost 30 years later. However, while Dragonite is a long-time favorite from the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>games, Victreebel, the pitcher plant Pokémon, is a much more surprising pick.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Victreebel was first teased on Tuesday, August 19, through </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1957790171216158990"><span>a social media post</span></a><span> on the official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>social channels which showed a hand gripping onto a rusted gate, presumably somewhere in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s Lumiose City where the game takes place. The image looks pretty ominous, and if it weren’t posted by the official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>account, you probably wouldn’t have known it was about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. The text even says “Viewer discretion advised,” probably so parents don’t show it to their young children. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is no stranger to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666"><span>dark stories</span></a><span> in its promo material, and even the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-arceus-ghostly-new-pokemon-belong-to-a-special-1847938579"><span>some pretty spooky shit in its trailers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The video is presented as found footage, showing two unsuspecting characters searching an abandoned building and finding a toxic purple substance and a bunch of scary Pokémon. At the end we see Mega Victreebel, whose destructive power scares the humans off. However, its trainer calms it down, and it turns out it’s not a terrifying monster; it’s just a goofy guy who doesn’t know its own strength. The official description on the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel">Pokémon website</a> says that it uses its own vines to keep all the acid it accumulates in its body by wrapping them around its throat. Mega Evolutions remain brutal.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Notably, Victreebel and Dragonite were both on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>list of leaked Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> from back in March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> takes the basic premise of the arcade classic <em>Breakout</em> and adapts it to a <em>Balatro</em>-style deckbuilder roguelike in which you shoot custom bullets to break bricks, win cash, collect upgrades, and extend your run. So far, so neat. But no small part of <em>Kill the Brickman</em>‘s staying power is in its surreal presentation that puts Blendo Games-looking faces on all the violence. The bricks you kill? Human. The bullets you shoot? Human. It all adds up to a punchy bite-sized arcade experience published by <em>Vampire Survivors</em> dev Poncle that’s just weird enough to keep me coming back.</p> <p>Revealed during the Microsoft Gamescom showcase on Thursday, <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is out August 21 on Xbox and PC. In keeping with its publishing partner’s tradition, the game is only $5. It’s made by Doonutsaur, a small U.S.-based team whose only other project on Steam is a similarly offbeat roguelike called <em>Meow Legion</em>. Poncle director&nbsp;Luca Galante apparently got an email about the game, immediately fell in love, and signed it just a few days later. “Imagine <em>Tetris</em>, but if the bricks had anger issues and a taste for human flesh,” reads the tagline in the press release.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> has you control a revolver at the bottom of the screen that you load custom bullets into. Some do more damage. Some have more bounces. Others can deal corrosive damage, and so on. Think the original <em>Breakout</em>, or one of its many clones, but instead of bouncing a ball to break bricks like a spin-off of <em>Pong</em>, you’re playing a turn-based puzzle shooter infused with light <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> RPG elements.</p>

 <p>Why are you killing the Brickman? Well, if they get to close they will hurt you and deplete your health. Once all your hearts are gone the run is over. But like in any good roguelike, skill and intuition will only get you so far. You try to complete mini-objectives in each level to score extra cash, which compounds interest just like in <em>Balatro</em>, to purchase the sorts of upgrades that will make or break your run later on. There are relics to collect that provide special bonuses, and different gun chambers that will augment bullet effects based on the pattern you reload them in.</p> <p>I’ve only played a couple hours (Poncle provided <em>Kotaku</em> with access to an advance copy), but it’s one of those games I’ve been trying to make 10-15 minutes for at the end of each day and end up playing way longer than I expected. <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is a tight set of gameplay concepts wrapped up in a cool CRT pixel art aesthetic and a bizarre sense of humor, or is it horror? I’m excited to keep playing and see where it goes.</p>
