              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-netflix-animated-stream-1851785935"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> is </span><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/top-10-reports/can-kpop-demon-hunters-topple-red-notice-plus-debuts-of-leanne-and-my-oxford-year-netflix-top-10-report/"><span>projected to possibly become Netflix’s most-streamed movie ever</span></a><span> in the coming weeks, and for good reason. The animated action musical is a visual feast that’s already made its way to </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>the #4 spot on Netflix’s all-time list</span></a><span>, buoyed by an incredible KPop soundtrack by fictional groups Huntr/x and Saja Boys that is topping the charts in the music world. That collection of original songs has been one of the major draws for the film, but how do those songs compare to one another? Some songs are elevated (or, in other cases, hindered) by their placement in the movie, but in a musical, no song is ever </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> a song. It’s a moment in a story crystallized and encapsulated in its most uninhibited form. So even if a song doesn’t quite hit the same way others do, that very feeling of something being off or the characters not quite giving it their all is very likely a storytelling tool in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>. We’re going to examine each of these numbers within that context and rank all seven of its original songs.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“Takedown”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Huntrix - Takedown (Lyrics) KPop Demon Hunters" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7P-ODFkHd5Y?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Hey, hey, hey. We just started. Put the tomatoes away until the end, please. “Takedown” is a fan favorite (let’s be honest, most of the songs are fan favorites because they’re all bangers), but when the song’s entire narrative meaning in the film is that the girls are decidedly unenthusiastic about the diss track, it’s not too surprising that it’s one of Huntr/x’s weaker works. It oozes attitude and grit, but even when it comes to those vibes, the song is pretty markedly outclassed by another song that blew the roof off at the beginning of the movie. Even when I was rewatching the film and hearing the girls brainstorm its lyrics without any of the backing music, I just didn’t feel that the group’s heart was in it like it is in all the other numbers. It’s an effective storytelling tool, but it doesn’t translate to one of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ better</span> <span>songs.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“Soda Pop”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Soda Pop&quot; Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/983bBbJx0Mk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Saja Boys’ debut single is, as Mira says while the demon boy band is performing it for the first time, “infectious.” It’s the most straightforward bubblegum pop song in the movie, and the group’s flirtatious sex appeal cranks its cutesy wordplay up to something that would have all the girls and gays losing their goddamn minds in an arena show. The Saja Boys mostly end up being extensions of Jinu’s plans throughout the movie, but “Soda Pop” is the one time it feels like all five members really get to express their individual personalities, from Baby Saja getting to rap to Romance having a…well, romantic, lilting singing tone that gets put on display in the pre-chorus. The whole thing is, on its face, the kind of chart-topping hit that brings a new boy band outfit into the spotlight, but it all hides an insidious undertone, as it talks about the audience as something to be consumed. That’s foreshadowing, baby.</span></p>

 <h2><b>“Golden”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="“Golden” Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yebNIHKAC4A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Ah, I see the tomatoes are out once again. Look, all these songs are great. “Golden,” easily the breakout song for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>based on chart and streaming numbers, is a gorgeous vocal showcase for lead singer Rumi, who absolutely soars as she sings of self-acceptance and her and her girls overcoming adversity to be their truest selves…only to take on a much more introspective, reserved tone in the bridge. As she privately whispers to herself about her own demonic patterns that she’s hidden from her friends and the world, “Golden” becomes a surprisingly subversive anthem that sets the tone for the entire film. It’s great! But it had some tough competition in this ranking.</span></p> <p><b>“Your Idol”</b></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Your Idol&quot; | Official Song Clip | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWppAbqm9I8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>The Saja Boys’ second song, “Your Idol,” is a masterful mask-off moment. The demonic group has shed their boy-band disguise and is presenting to an audience of brainwashed fans as their true, hellish selves. Gone are the neon color palettes of the Saja Boys’ original costumes; they’re now dressed in traditional Korean garb with their demonic patterns exposed for all the world to see. If that weren’t enough of an indicator that everything has gone awry, the song’s haunting Latin chant in the opening portends a world completely overtaken by the demon king and his musical lackeys. Even as the song shifts into an absolutely filthy industrial pop beat, the choir still chants underneath the Saja Boys’ singing as they beckon the helpless crowd into the mouth of the demon king. Jinu and his demon crew still put on a seductive show, but their violent intention is no longer masked behind boyish good looks. It’s a harrowing song that’s also an absolute banger.</span></p> <h2><b>“How It’s Done”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;How It's Done&quot; Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGsevnbItdU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>“Takedown” is billed as </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ diss track, but “How It’s Done,” the opening number that introduces Huntr/x’s demon-hunting musical talents, is so superior as a showcase of the girls’ attitude, lyricism, and their status as pro-level haters, that it takes the wind out of the other song’s sails. “How It’s Done” and the opening sequence set to it make for such an incredible tone-setter for the whole film that it’s a feat in and of itself that the movie manages to live up to it across the rest of its runtime. It’s a barrage of nasty reads, fierce wordplay, and infectious swagger set to incredible demon-slaying choreography. Every beat, bar, and change in flow has a corresponding strike, stab, or bludgeon as the girls rock a bunch of demons’ shit while rapping and singing about how these foes are just cannon fodder, roaches to be crushed under their heels while they get ready to perform for thousands of adoring fans. Then these absolute queens </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>dive onto the stage while skysurfing on their enemies’ ragdolling bodies and making sure their makeup and hair are just right. If you came into </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>even vaguely unconvinced it would have the sauce, Huntr/x silences any doubts with “How It’s Done.” God, that shit rules.</span></p>

 <h2><b>“Free”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Free&quot; | Official Lyric Video | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjOeJssZX_Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>I think “Free” is the best animated musical love song since “A Whole New World” from </span><i><span>Aladdin</span></i><span>. I know that’s a bold statement, but Rumi and Jinu’s lone duet in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is such a lovely vocal showcase for both singers, and by god, I feel my soul lift from my body every time the chorus hits. “Free” is </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>at its most restrained, and even then, it is head and shoulders above the best most movie musicals have to offer as a vocal showcase for its leads. The ballad is a beautiful admission from two warring parties that they can dream of a life beyond the ones they’ve been told they have to have, and maybe, if they can find a way, they can reach that life together. Rumi’s singing is as gorgeous as ever, but one of the most surprising aspects is Jinu’s rap-like verse that manages to fit surprisingly well into a song that, up until that point, had been a pretty straightforward ballad. The song builds so well, utilizing both singers’ strengths in a way that makes it feel like the two are crafting it together, making space for one another’s talents as well as all their faults. Goddamn, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>knows how to tell a story in songwriting just as well as it does in lyricism.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“What It Sounds Like”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="“What It Sounds Like” Song Clip | KPop Demon Hunters | Netflix Family" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ug_pv5-r1js?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>A good musical can live or die by its closing number. By the time </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> reaches “What It Sounds Like,” it’s already had six good to incredible songs, and it somehow has to leave on a note that wraps up its story, sums up everything its characters have learned, and is also an incredible group performance that manages to be at least on par with everything it’s already done. “What It Sounds Like” does all of that so effortlessly that I’m still kind of in awe of it. You know what I do when I’m not listening to “What It Sounds Like”? I’m watching people react to it and making sure I’m not the only person who cries his eyes out as Huntr/x, having been torn apart and nearly lost to demonic influence, sing their apologies to one another as they fight their way through an army of demon spawn. The audience watches on, singing with them, and empowering the group to keep fighting, and eventually, they win the day.</span></p> <p><span>Much of Rumi’s inner struggle in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is in the self-imposed restraints she’s put on herself after being told for her whole life that she was a mistake to be corrected. It’s why her heart isn’t in the anti-demon sentiment of “Takedown.” It’s why “Golden” has to have an aside in which she gets to talk about what she’s actually feeling before she goes back out on stage to sing about the joys of being herself. “What It Sounds Like” is an anthemic summation of everything she and the rest of Huntr/x should have been doing this entire time. Rather than hiding everything from each other and the public and pretending to be perfect to write a song they couldn’t believe in, they’re putting it all on the line for one final, world-saving song that reflects who they truly are, rather than who they’ve been told they should be.</span></p> <p><span>“The song we couldn’t write, this is what it sounds like.”</span></p>

              <p>Did Tencent just stealthily try to walk itself back from the brink after getting sued by Sony for trying to rush a <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">brazen ripoff of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> to market? Will the PlayStation 6 be Sony’s least important console yet? And do we finally have our first real clue as to when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will come out? Welcome to the latest Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news, trailers, and other fascinating curios, like how the proprietor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw">Mom’s Spaghetti</a> is totally chill with being known as “<a href="https://twitter.com/Shadyind/status/1953257598129717757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953257598129717757%7Ctwgr%5E7f954647bca4ad74de71348ad09444d1288fa6ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwatch-eminem-react-to-being-called-that-guy-from-fortnite%2F1100-6533781%2F">The guy from <em>Fortnite</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Tencent tries to pretend the <em>Light of Motiram</em> never happened</h2> <p>The Chinese conglomerate was recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163">sued by Sony,</a> who alleged that Tencent kept trying to license <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> for a survival crafting game and, when Sony kept saying no, turned around and made it anyway. A week later, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/"><em>The Game Post</em> noticed</a> that developer Polaris Quest has quietly been changing out the worst offending images, language, and key art from the game’s Steam page.&nbsp;References to “colossal machines” and “Mechanimals” were stripped from the description and the screenshots and art now focus on generic scenes instead of <em>Light of Motiram</em>‘s Temu version of Aloy. Now that Sony has called Tencent’s bluff, it’ll probably continue to strip out the most egregious <em>Horizon</em> copycat elements from the game. We’ll see if that’s enough to get the PS5 maker to settle.</p> <h2>Sony is moving away from a “hardware centric business model” ahead of the PS6</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony Senior Vice President Sadahiko Hayakawa says they are gradually shifting their gaming business from a hardware centric business model to a community and engagement based platform business model <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a></p> <p>“In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric… <a href="https://t.co/8xnKyihMHE">pic.twitter.com/8xnKyihMHE</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The console war is grinding to an end. With <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on PlayStation and<em> Helldivers 2</em> coming to Xbox, the old rivalries are slowly, if not completely, fading into the background. “In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement,” senior Sony VP Sadahiko Hayakawa said this week. While in line with the company’s previous comments about focusing more on total players and engagement time over unit sales, the remark still raised eyebrows as the PS5 continues to dominate. Former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment of America Shawn Layden responded with a GIF of <em>God of War</em>‘s Kratos <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1953706271594397696">putting his head in his hands</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Xbox Rog Ally release date may have just leaked</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs poster billbil-kun</a>, the new PC gaming handhelds aiming to deliver Xbox-like console experiences will come out in Europe on October 16. Neither the date nor the price of the upcoming hardware has been officially revealed yet, though billbil-kun previously claimed it would cost €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the more powerful Xbox Ally X in Europe. We’ll have to wait and see how those prices translate to the U.S. amid Trump’s current tariff war.</p> <h2>A very convincing theory for<em> Silksong</em>‘s possible release date</h2> <p>Xbox fans will remember that Microsoft used <em>Silksong</em> to hype the Xbox Rog Ally reveal back during its Xbox summer showcase. The most wishlisted game on Steam would be “available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year,” Xbox president Sarah Bond said at the time. Based on this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/we-might-actually-have-a-tenuous-silksong-release-date-absolutely-nobody-on-my-team-believes-me-and-i-think-i-can-hear-hornet-in-my-walls/"><em>PC Gamer</em>‘s Harvey Randall</a> speculates that, if the October 16 leak is accurate, that could also be <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch date. That day is also a Thursday, which is when most new Switch 1 and Switch 2 games come out. Hmmm. Or maybe Bond simply meant that <em>Silksong</em> would already be out by the time the Xbox ROG Ally arrives, which, if that’s the case, is even better!</p> <h2><em>Ashes of the Singularity 2</em> is happening</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ashes of the Singularity II  |  Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The real-time strategy game known for its massive armies will return with a sequel nearly a decade later, this time with a human faction. There’s no release date yet and my current PC will just barely be able to run it but as a huge fan of<em> Total Annihilation</em>, one of the series’ influences, I can’t wait.</p>

              <p>Late on August 7, <em>GTA</em> publisher Take Two put out its quarterly earnings report, accompanied by a shareholder Q&amp;A and interviews with CEO Strauss Zelnick appearing on various outlets. Obviously, the big question everyone had is: How much are you going to charge for <em>GTA 6</em>? Zelnick chose to deliver some extra-special corporate gloop instead of actually answering.</p> <p>Rumors have been flying back and forth over the price of next year’s&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>, with a recent round of “industry analyst” nonsense <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-i-expect-a-usd100-price-point-for-gta-6-estimates-rockstars-development-cost-is-over-usd1-5-billion-and-predicts-it-will-earn-usd10-billion-lifetime-and-another-usd500-million-annually-from-gta-online/">declaring that the game will cost $100</a>. However, while something around $70 to $80 seems far more likely, Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick avoided giving a price when speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p> <p>Game prices are in something of a hinterland, with many publishers wanting to follow Nintendo’s lead up to a standard price of $80 but seemingly being afraid to push the button. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">Microsoft recently backtracked on the plan</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">EA has made clear it intends to stick with $70 for the foreseeable future</a>, and perhaps most relevantly here, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">Take Two recently said&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> would be $70</a>, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445">Randy Pitchford made a twerp of himself on the subject</a>. Many, however, are predicting that if any game could push prices up, it’s&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>

 <p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, Zelnick put modesty aside and said of <em>GTA 6</em>, “I do think it’s fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment.” Given this confidence, you might think the CEO would be willing to just state the intended price for the game. However, when&nbsp;<em>Variety&nbsp;</em>spoke to him, he instead prevaricated.</p> <p>“Our goal is always to deliver more value than we charge,” Zelnick told the outlet, which are words that <em>look</em> like they should mean something. He continued, “so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever.” Mentioning special editions and so on, the response finished, “I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it.” Yes, but how much will it cost?</p> <p>Zelnick was equally bemusing about <em>Borderlands 4</em> during August 8’s earnings call, responding to a shareholder question about why <em>that</em> game will be $70, “We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth.” Yes, but why is it $70?</p>

 <p>When 2020 prices were stepping up from $60 to $70 as a console standard, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-interactive-next-gen-software-price-increases-reflect-the-quality-of-the-experience">Zelnick wasn’t nearly so shy</a> about justifying the increased costs. “We think with the value we offer consumers…and the kind of experience you can really only have on these next-generation consoles, that the price is justified,” the CEO told <em>GI.biz</em> at the time. “But it’s easy to say that when you’re delivering extraordinary quality, and that’s what our company prides itself on doing.”</p> <p>So, we still have no idea what Take Two will be charging for May 26’s&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Presumably there’s a desire to hold off and see which way the wind blows over the next nine months. Given Nintendo is sticking to its guns at $80 for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but then confusing everything by charging $70 for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, there’s no clear indication yet. Certainly Microsoft and Sony appear to be sticking to $70 for the upcoming holiday season, but it seems entirely possible that $80 will creep in during 2026.</p> <p>And yes, sure, Take Two&nbsp;<em>could</em> charge $100 for&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, but it’d be a bad move that would do reputational damage to both the publisher and the game. Presumably there will be a “premium” version priced at around $100, and possibly another at $130 or more, but it seems vanishingly unlikely the vanilla game will cost more than eighty bucks.</p>
