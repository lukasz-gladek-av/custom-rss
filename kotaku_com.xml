Since then, Rockstar has shared no new official screenshots, videos, or trailers for the upcoming open-world sequel.

Well, in a recent interview Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick implied that a new trailer might not arrive until closer to launch, and that’s to pump up excitement. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span>, Zelnick was asked bluntly why <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s release date was such a big secret. The CEO laughed and gave a big grin before answering that the date is a secret because they want to keep fans excited. </p><p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” said the former 20th Century FOX President. “And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p><p>Of course, he fails to mention that at this stage Rockstar Games likely hasn’t committed to a release date yet. And any internal dates or milestones are still very fluid. Game development is messy and trying to predict when things will be finished is hard, especially with a game the size of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/take-two-t2-ceo-zelnick-gta-6-rockstar-pc-port-xbox-ps5-1851512434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-t2-ceo-zelnick-gta-6-rockstar-pc-port-xbox-ps5-1851512434"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>Zelnick also explained that they will provide “marketing” assets closer to the launch of <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p> “And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. I don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">We at <em>Kotaku </em>predict, based on various factors</a></span>, that<em> GTA 6</em> will arrive in late October.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264?_gl=1*g6doqr*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0NzM3OS40Ni4wLjE3NDM0NDczODIuNTcuMC4w"> And with theSwitch 2 reportedly launching in June</a></span> and Take-Two’s <em>other</em> big game, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, arriving in late September, I’d hazard a guess that <em>GTA 6</em>'s second trailer might drop in early August or perhaps the last week of July.

While each of their abilities are somewhat limited, you’ll maintain control of two characters with completely different roles, so balancing them will be key to excelling.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Dagger is a straightforward healer, with abilities to heal up single targets and groups alike. Her defensive Ultimate helps your team and hurts your enemies at the same time with only one real weakness, and her healing primary attack has limited aim assist. She’s a great healer to get started with. Cloak, on the other hand, is somewhat similar to Scarlet Witch, who is a Duelist. He has a mid-range attack that deals steady damage, but he can also debuff enemies, reducing their visibility, dealing damage, and causing them to take more damage for a time. He also has an ability that grants invincibility for a few seconds. </p><p>Since you can instantly switch between them, fans of both healing and damaging will find a lot to love about this pair.</p><h2 id="h178463"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Cloak &amp; Dagger?</h2><p>Dagger is a very approachable healer since you don’t need to have great aim to heal well with her Lightforce Daggers bounce and bend towards allies and enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-recommend-id="image://d1e120d8278e468628dde992eef37beb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagger attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In spite of this, there is still skill required to play her and her comrade to their maximum potential—and much of that involves how much time you spend playing as Cloak. A great Cloak &amp; Dagger player will use Light Explosion and Dagger Storm to keep allies topped off, using downtime to switch to Cloak and deal damage, hitting enemies with Terror Cape to amplify team damage against vulnerable targets, and using Dark Teleportation to negate enemy Ultimate abilities before switching back to Dagger to heal allies again.</p><figure id="" data-id="deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-recommend-id="image://deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloak attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloak attacks enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-recommend-id="image://deec124247b8f736ca676f68bf263b30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloak attacks enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Eternal Bond is one of the fastest charging Ultimate abilities in the game, be aware that enemies like Magneto can easily kill you in-between dashes (if they know what they are doing), so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord use their Ultimates to bait it out before you use yours, or use it when Magneto has been knocked out or does not have an ultimate charge ready yet.</p><h2 id="h178464"><a id="dagger"></a>What are Dagger’s Abilities?</h2><figure id="" data-id="089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-recommend-id="image://089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Dagger's various abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Dagger's various abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-recommend-id="image://089e38adf58a0ac7e31a026b77f6e42c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Dagger's various abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Lightforce Dagger:</strong> Your primary attack. Bounces towards enemies and allies, damaging enemies and healing allies. A very easy attack to use, and one you should be constantly holding down. It needs a reload, but you can quickly switch to Cloak and back again to reload faster.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate): </strong>Same as Dagger’s.</li><li><strong>Shadow’s Embrace: </strong>Switches to Cloak. Switching to Cloak and back again will reload Lightforce Dagger slightly faster than the standard reload animation.</li><li><strong>Light Explosion:</strong> Throw a large rectangle of light towards your target, healing them a slight amount and boosting subsequent healing they receive. Use this on enemies who are getting hurt a lot before using Lightforce Dagger or Dagger Storm on them.</li><li><strong>Dagger Storm:</strong> Throw a ball of light that expands into a dome, healing all allies within it over time. The primary way Dagger can heal herself, so throw it at your feet if you are getting hurt and the other Strategist is far away. You can also switch to Cloak after creating Dagger Storm to fight back against approaching Dualists like Spider-Man, and more.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive):</strong> Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><h2 id="h178465"><a id="cloak"></a>What are Cloak’s Abilities?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Brian Barnett / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-recommend-id="image://5ede5e33df925e5af7c102b42f6a2923" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Cloak's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Darkforce Cloak: </strong>Your primary attack. Like Scarlet Witch, this ability deals constant damage to enemies who are in the close and mid-range. So long as you hold the button down, and aim near the enemy, they’ll keep taking damage. A great way to strike back at enemies trying to take Dagger out.</li><li><strong>Eternal Bond (Ultimate):</strong> Same as Dagger’s. Four dashes, each aimable, lay down a Light/Dark power on the ground, damaging all enemies and healing all allies standing on it. A very powerful Ultimate ability, and one which charges very quickly. Be aware that enemies like Magneto can kill you in-between dashes, so try to have a teammate like Punisher or Star Lord bait it out before you use this, or have a Loki on your team to have two Eternal Bonds.</li><li><strong>Light’s Embrace:</strong> Switches to Dagger.</li><li><strong>Terror Cape: </strong>Throws a rectangle of dark energy in the direction you are aiming, significantly reducing visibility for enemies struck with it. Also deals damage and makes them Vulnerable, making them take more damage from all sources for a time. Use this every 12 seconds, when it comes off cooldown, against the most vulnerable targets on the enemy team.</li><li><strong>Dark Teleportation: </strong>Causes yourself, and nearby allies, to become invisible, untargetable, and quicker movement speed. A well-timed Dark Teleportation can completely negate certain enemy Ultimate abilities. Iron Man shooting his ultimate at your team? Switch to Cloak and use this ability, and you’ll take no damage. It only lasts a moment, so your timing will need to be precise.</li><li><strong>From Shadow To Light (Team-Up: Passive): </strong>Teaming up with Moon Knight will give him the ability to create a sphere of invisibility for himself.</li></ul><hr><p>With all these tips in hand, you are prepared to become a true master of both light and dark. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nine of those homers happened in one game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/yankees-hit-historic-9-home-runs-including-3-from-aaron-judge-and-3-off-games-first-3-pitches-to-crush-brewers-174733967.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/yankees-hit-historic-9-home-runs-including-3-from-aaron-judge-and-3-off-games-first-3-pitches-to-crush-brewers-174733967.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three of them happened off the first three pitches of Saturday’s game</a></span> against the Milwaukee Brewers. But nobody seems to be talking about how great the Yankees performed over the weekend; instead the conversation is entirely focused on the weird “Torpedo” bats used by some Yankee players like shortstop Anthony Volpe, who hit two home runs over the weekend. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/did-yankees-physicist-designed-torpedo-bats-play-role-in-9-hr-power-surge-vs-brewers-224436396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Torpedo bats</a></span> look very strange when compared to the standard tube-like design of most professional baseball bats.

This tumor-like spot looks odd, but it has more mass and, the theory is, that leads to harder hits and more home runs. And so far, the bat seems to be legal based on the MLB’s rules. </p><p>“The concept makes so much sense,” said  Volpe before Sunday’s game. “I know I’m bought in. The bigger you can have the barrel where you hit the ball, it makes sense to me.”</p><p>Three other Yankee players as well as two other MLB pro players used the strange bat over the weekend, too. Yet not all of them hit multiple home runs. Meanwhile, Yankee player Aaron Judge was able to hit six homers over opening weekend without using the new bats. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/whats-the-deal-with-the-yankees-torpedo-bats-and-are-they-really-a-competitive-advantage-000747259.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Yahoo Sports</em></a></span>, when asked about the new bats, Judge said: “What I did the past couple of seasons speaks for itself. Why try to change something if you have something that’s working?”</p><h2 id="h54706"><a id=""></a>Reactions to the new Torpedo bats</h2><p>Still, the Yankees hitting so many home runs while using strange new bats has ruffled some feathers, in a sport that is filled with tradition and is slow to change. At least one player for the Brewers, Trevor Megill, wasn’t happy about the opposing team using Torpedo bats over the weekend. </p><p>“I think it’s terrible,’’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/30/sports/brewers-closer-fumes-over-yankees-new-bowling-pin-bats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Megill told the <em>New York Post</em></a></span>. “We’ll see what the data says. I’ve never seen anything like it before. I feel like it’s something used in slow-pitch softball. It’s genius: Put the mass all in one spot. It might be bush [league]. It might not be. But it’s the Yankees, so they’ll let it slide.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/mlb-reactions-to-yankees-torpedo-bats-range-from-its-terrible-to-they-should-send-a-few-over-here-044054221.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Other players were more open to the new bat design</a></span> or suggested it might not work for everyone. </p><p>It should be noted that other teams besides the Yankees used the new bats over the weekend, and there’s some evidence that they’ve been around since last season. What makes things confusing is that the Torpedo bat isn’t a singular design, but more a new way to build bats where you place more mass in a specific spot. There’s also some debate as to how helpful they are and if they really provide a massive advantage. It still takes a lot of skill to swing a bat fast and accurately enough to hit a home run against MLB’s skilled pitchers.</p><p> Still, in a sport where even a slim advantage can be very important, that hasn’t stopped teams from taking notice. <em>Yahoo Sports</em> reports that after opening weekend, 29 other teams are now looking to optimize their own equipment to create their own Torpedo bats. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
