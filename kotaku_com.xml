Too Kyo Games was founded in 2017 after Kodaka and co-founder Kotaro Uchikoshi left Spike Chunsoft following the success of the <em>Danganronpa </em>and <em>Zero Escape </em>franchises. In the years since, Too Kyo Games has released several projects that captured the individual leads’ creative styles, but <em>The Hundred Line </em>certainly feels like more of a melding of the minds than anything else the company has put out. It has <em>Danganronpa</em>’s signature school life social sim elements, and then its second half reveals an elaborate, multi-route branching storyline that can lead to one of 100 endings like a power-boosted <em>Zero Escape</em>. For such a small team, it was a wildly ambitious project, and that’s why it took five long years of development and some financial favors to finish. Now, Kodaka says that the game is selling “pretty well,” and he doesn’t see bankruptcy “as a serious future” for the company.</p><p>So now what? Too Kyo Games has put out its dream game and it’s doing well. Never one to shy away from his ambitions, Kodaka says he wants to extend <em>The Hundred Line</em>’s life for another decade by adding new storylines with patches and expansions, almost like a live-service game.</p><p>“I tried to aim this game to be like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>,” Kodaka told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “I want it to be the open world of ‘scenario’ games.”</p><p><em>The Hundred Line </em>starts out with a pretty standard visual novel structure. You play as a squad of high school students forced to defend an academy from alien invaders in an effort to protect a weapon hidden within its walls—the key to humanity’s survival—for 100 days. After those three months and change are up, some other stuff we won’t spoil goes down that puts the game on wildly divergent paths, with each route helmed by different writers. As a result, every path is markedly different than the others, though there is one route that unveils the game’s whole truth if you know how to find it. Each of these routes has multiple endings, some of which are obviously “conclusions” while others read like “bad ends.” Given the buck-wild directions some of these routes go, it doesn’t seem like much is off-limits in terms of genre and tone for <em>The Hundred Line</em>. So if the studio pulls from a rotating stable of writers, I can see the game staying fresh for several years. Now that Too Kyo Games is in a better position to support its latest release, it feels safe to hope for the game’s future, as well as the studio’s. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150]]></content:encoded>

Assembling an entirely Acceleration-focused kart and driver can be a detriment in races with longer stretches of road. Someone with a higher Speed stat will pass you eventually.</p><p>There is a lot of nuance as to what karts and characters are the model pairing for each track, if not the best overall combo. Acceleration is arguably the ideal kart stat for most players, but it all comes down to preference. Some might feel better with a Speed build or one that’s more balanced. Always go with what feels the best and most rewarding. If your dream is to conquer every 150cc set of races with Cataquack and the Lobster Roller, more power to you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-best-vehicles-online-150cc-1851786067]]></content:encoded>

But even the worst games don’t deserve to be obliterated.</p><p>In 2019, I tried to see the good in <em>Anthem</em>. I recognized it for what it was: a trend-chasing game likely demanded from on high by a publisher looking for its next live-service hit. It didn’t matter if it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">pulling resources</a></span> from the types of games BioWare was historically known for or if it was diametrically opposed to what made the studio such a powerhouse in the western RPG landscape. Loot shooters and forever games were the current hotness, and expertise and legacy weren’t as important as the trend of the moment. But in the margins, I saw flashes of BioWare’s best-in-class character writing, and by god, its flying mechanics still feel pretty incredible in 2025. But now that EA and BioWare are shutting the game down, what once felt like a studio trying to make the best of a bad situation just feels like a cynical attempt at fitting a square peg into a round hole.</p><p><em>Anthem </em>is the quintessential “made by committee” video game. It looks like the kind of thing you see a kid playing in the background of a TV show that is just descriptive enough to read as a video game but not distinct enough to have any discernible personality of its own. Everything about it feels like it’s meant to depersonalize you in favor of a spotlighting faceless, ugly suit of armor called a Javelin. You can’t customize your freelancer’s appearance, the character doesn’t even have a name, and the preset faces you choose will show up in-game fewer times than you can count on one hand. Its binary dialogue choices feel specifically written to have no impact, rather than even attempting to emulate the illusion of choice like the rest of BioWare’s catalog. </p><p>The only real expression you get is in the colors and designs you slap on your Javelin, and even the sleekest among them are some ugly clunkers that no amount of customization can beautify. You can change up your emotes, but they’re the same handful every other player has. In many of their other releases, against all odds, BioWare has excelled in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">handing players a higher level of authorship</a></span> than they usually receive in big-budget games. <em>Anthem</em>, meanwhile, doesn’t just feel like a pivot away from player expression; it feels like it was actively trying to stifle it at any chance it could. In 2019, I had some hope that BioWare would course-correct this in future updates, but now that those aren’t coming, what remains of <em>Anthem</em> feels creatively sterile, both for players and BioWare.</p><figure id="" data-id="0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-recommend-id="image://0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-recommend-id="image://0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re not flying around in your Javelin, most of <em>Anthem </em>takes place in a vaguely sci-fi fantasy fortress called Fort Tarsis. Here is where some of BioWare’s strengths show, with characters who provide tantalizing glimpses into a world that feels otherwise underdeveloped. Owen, the player’s sprightly assistant who eventually betrays you, could have been a classic BioWare character in a game that afforded its relationships the same depth as its other work. But because <em>Anthem </em>can only gesture at the acclaimed BioWare house style, characters mostly talk <em>at</em> the player, rather than to them. Meeting <em>Anthem</em>’s cast feels voyeuristic, with its first-person perspective and lackluster dialogue options emulating something like Disney’s theme parks that have a character set up in one designated area for you to interact with briefly as you pass through. Ironically enough, that feels appropriate given that a lot of Fort Tarsis feels like an abandoned theme park. Walking through rooms that were once meant to facilitate repeatable quests is haunting, given that there aren’t other players to help you play through them.</p><p>As much as playing <em>Anthem </em>feels like looking into a void, flying through its non-descript environments still fucking rules. The flight controls feel incredible. The Javelins you can pick from are each huge, clunky monstrosities, but <em>Anthem </em>manages to make them feel weighty and light on their feet at the same time. Flight in video games is easy to get wrong because it can often either feel too slow to be useful or it can be so floaty that it can be hard to maintain control and precision. <em>Anthem</em> hits the perfect sweet spot. It’s kind of wild that the internet spent so long clowning on BioWare for <em>Anthem</em>’s misguided live-service aspirations and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/people-are-ripping-apart-mass-effect-andromedas-animati-1793334047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/people-are-ripping-apart-mass-effect-andromedas-animati-1793334047"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s animations</a></span> that we glossed over how the studio had become a real force to be reckoned with on the action combat front. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">is rightfully divisive</a></span>, but it received a lot of praise for its tight, fluid combat. <em>Anthem </em>is a dry as hell game emulating trends it was years late to, but you won’t find a better Iron Man simulator on the market. That’s including the actual <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508"><em>Iron Man VR</em> game</a></span>. Well, that’s actually your only option now, because <em>Anthem </em>isn’t actually on the market anymore. The game<em> </em>has been delisted from every online store, and physical copies are going to stop working in January.</p><figure id="" data-id="c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-recommend-id="image://c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-recommend-id="image://c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I played through the early hours of <em>Anthem</em>, I had almost forgotten it was supposed to be a multiplayer game. There were hints, such as the way mission objectives were spread across large areas encouraging teams of players to split up to find them, but I was having a decent enough time handling the game myself that it wasn’t until the haunting “matchmaking” icon showed up when I tried to start a mission, only to get no answer from other players, that I forgot <em>this </em>is why <em>Anthem </em>is going away forever.</p><p>In EA’s announcement blog, there’s a Q&amp;A section that says the reason <em>Anthem </em>is shutting down and will be unplayable after January is that the game was “designed to be an online-only title, so once the servers go offline, the game will no longer be playable.” Meanwhile, here I am, holding my own in battles which, yes, were obviously meant to be experienced by multiple players at once, but are still perfectly serviceable to play alone. But putting in the effort under the hood to make <em>Anthem </em>a single-player game someone could still experience after next January would require work that EA and BioWare don’t seem willing to do. No one at the studio has been working on <em>Anthem</em>, and EA even confirms in the post that flipping the switch in January won’t result in any layoffs. So if no one’s working on it at all right now, why would they devote the resources to rebalancing the game for offline play so it isn’t dropped into a black hole?</p><p>One of the frequent refrains in <em>Anthem </em>is that freelancers are “strong alone, stronger together.” At the time, this tagline felt like a desperate plea to BioWare fans who had grown accustomed to the team’s solitary RPGs that they weren’t being left behind in this uncharacteristic pivot. <em>Anthem </em>is a game you can play with others, but if you persist, you can play it by yourself, too, right? Well, not anymore.</p><figure id="" data-id="4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-recommend-id="image://4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-recommend-id="image://4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shutting down <em>Anthem </em>is probably the right business decision. If I can’t even find players when the game is in its final months, that probably means that not enough people are roaming around Fort Tarsis to justify the cost of keeping the game online. That being said, it also feels like one last deluded assertion that the game couldn’t have been anything other than what it was. It’s an act that asserts <em>Anthem </em>was always intended to be exclusively a multiplayer experience, an assertion that the game itself insists wasn’t the case time and time again. Finishing the scant story content that exists in <em>Anthem</em>, the start of what was meant to be a years-long endeavor, feels like scrambling through a series of unfinished design documents, with vague ideas written in big red letters that it doesn’t feel like BioWare or EA really had thought about much. But even given the slapdash approach here, EA destroying <em>Anthem</em> while also scattering the studio’s foundational talent to the winds marks the latest instance of cultural vandalism this company has committed on BioWare’s history.</p><p>Whatever BioWare was planning was killed before it got out the door, and now all we have is a time capsule of corporate hubris, and we won’t even have that for much longer. <em>Anthem </em>had such a blind confidence in “the demands of the market” that it forgot to consider whether following them was worthwhile. Nobody knew where <em>Anthem </em>was going. After years of work, the upheaval of a studio’s storied legacy, and years of horror stories to go with it, it turns out the only place <em>Anthem </em>went was absolutely nowhere.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136]]></content:encoded>

There’s been a search for what the Square Enix franchise, which Sandfall Interactive’s <em>Clair Obscur </em>was inspired by, can learn from the new kid on the block. For some long-time fans, one of the takeaways has been that the Japanese series should return to its roots as a turn-based game. <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>producer Naoki Yoshida was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about that at Anime Expo 2025</a></span>.</p><p>“With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system,” he responded. “That doesn’t take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game’s systems around it.”</p><p>Yoshida  continued, “This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It’s not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it’s going to become more action-based. [I’m] not necessarily going to be on <em>Final Fantasy 17</em>, so we also don’t want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like<em> 17</em> or even <em>18</em>. We don’t want to put them on a rail.”</p><p>The answer helped elucidate all of the considerations that go into designing a sequel. You can’t just pick things from a list and start sticking them together. Each element, from the graphical style to the type of story being told to the gameplay mechanics, needs to compliment one another and act in harmony. Ideally, each thing might flow organically into the next, making each new decision feel like a natural consequence of the last rather than something being arbitrarily inserted to please fans or shareholders. </p><p>Something I think a lot of the conversations lording <em>Clair Obscur</em> over <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s head miss are that combat isn’t where the latter has faltered in recent years. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s arcade-like real-time action is flashy, precise, and incredibly satisfying. The only real shortcomings were that it didn’t dive deeper into some of the underlying systems—more Eikon ability synergies, elemental damage, more varied equipment options—and it wasn’t hard enough . Each of those is easily iterated on in a sequel, as the series has done throughout its history. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> offers an even bigger rebuttal to the turn-based question in my mind because that’s essentially still what it is. <em>Final Fantasy</em> combat has long operated on a continuum between static and real-time, going back to the series’ introduction of the ATB system to let enemies act independent of player decision-making. This is why Square Enix often refers to<em> Rebirth</em> as a command combat system. While you can move around in battles and positioning is important, the most important tasks are all automated by the characters themselves and carried out by selecting them from a menu. There are dodges, parries, synergies, summons, and all the rest, but at its core it’s already working off the same logic as <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s combat system, and in much more robust ways. </p><p>It’s perfectly fine if fans just want a new<em> Final Fantasy</em> that marries expensive graphics with a traditional turn-based system, though there are no shortage of other RPGs out there, including many from Square Enix itself, that already cater to those classic sensibilities. But the combat itself is far from the weakest part of the modern entries in the franchise. What’s actually holding it back, without a doubt, are the stories. I’m not going to relitigate every turn in each of the sprawling adventures release over the last decade. I’d argue <em>Final Fantasy</em> storytelling has been on the decline since the end of the PS2 generation with <em>FFXII</em>, a still-stellar game for plenty of other reasons. <em>Rebirth </em>and <em>FFXVI</em> both had glaring issues, though. </p><p><em>Rebirth</em> is a world-class game in so many ways, from the cinematic presentation to the maximalist open-world design, but it bungles many of the original source material’s most important moments without providing interesting new interpretations, tensions, or epiphanies in return. The Gold Saucer section is a perfect encapsulation. The theme park is beautifully and entertainingly recreated and chock full of fun distractions. But Barret’s backstory of having his YIMBY idealism exploited by Shinra to turn his hometown into a Mako-harvesting dump gets short shrift and feels hollowed out. His encounter with Dyne, the friend whose life he accidentally ruined, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1e295v7/what_the_fuck_did_they_do_to_dyne_in_rebirth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1e295v7/what_the_fuck_did_they_do_to_dyne_in_rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is overshadowed by a cartoony infusion of clear-cut moralism</a></span>. It was one of many narrative misfires up and through <em>Rebirth</em>’s bizarre ending. </p><p><em>FFXVI</em> faltered even more frequently. For every great character moment between Clive, Joshua, and Cid, there was something in the larger narrative about geopolitical rivalries and enslaved magic users that was either straight-up dumb or borderline offensive. It never quite grapples with the stakes of its grim worldbuilding before eventually ditching it all for some old-school <em>Final Fantasy</em> guy-in-the-sky deus ex machina shit that undermines everything players had previously become so emotionally invested in. I say this with complete love for the game as a whole, which I am currently playing a second time, but <em>FFXVI</em> lives up to its <em>Game of Thrones</em> influences with a third act that’s every bit as disappointing as the end of the HBO series. </p><p>My take away from<em> Clair Obscur, </em>then, is not that RPGs need to be turn-based to find love again, but that <em>even</em> a turn-based RPG can win over modern audiences if the story, acting, and presentation are all top notch. There is no reason the next <em>Final Fantasy</em> can’t do all of those things on top of harnessing the franchise’s current combat systems. For everyone else, well, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> shouldn’t be that far away. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-turn-based-combat-clair-obscur-ff16-1851786128]]></content:encoded>

One notable feature that isn’t explained at all are the handful of giant vehicles you can briefly take over. It doesn’t take long to figure out that driving into the large question mark opening on their backside is key to controlling them, but none of that matters if you can’t find any to begin with.

This is the biggest NPC vehicle by far. It stands out with its two containers that display <em>Mario Kart</em> in large red letters. <strong>Semi-Trucks are typically encountered on wide paved roads with multiple lanes.</strong> I’ve often seen them in connecting races with Toad’s Factory as well as the Golden Gate Bridge lookalike that connects Crown City and Faraway Oasis.</p><p>The standard circuit races don’t feature long stretches as much, so you won’t see any of these unless you’re driving between tracks. No need to worry about the sanctity of an old-fashioned race ruined by an obnoxiously fast automobile.</p><p>Another way to drive Semi-Trucks, as well as the other vehicles we’ll be covering, is to take on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">P-Switch Challenges</a></span>.

Pushing the stick up will plunge the nose of the boat into the water, while pushing the stick down will lift the nose up. Alternating between the two can help you soar above big waves.</p><h2 id="h127730"><a id=""></a>Where to find Helicopters</h2><figure id="" data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Special vehicles only get rarer from here. First up is the Helicopter, which is easy to spot in the air thanks to their chunky orange design. Bear in mind that these are separate from the tiny yellow MKTV helicopters that spectate races. <strong>Helicopters fly in a preset loop, so the best way to take one over in Free Roam is to follow it until it lands for a short period.</strong></p><p>Finding them during a race is also a mixed-bag. They’re not located in similar environments the way Semi-Trucks and Speedboats are. I’ve also seen more variance in how they’re presented, such as being an integral part of the race from DK Spaceport to Peace Stadium. Conversely, you can find one hidden behind a building when racing between Mario Bros. Circuit to Toad Factory. </p><p>Controls for the Helicopter also make full use of your Joy-con’s stick, and in proper inverted orientation for flight: Moving it up will make the Helicopter descend, while moving it down makes the Helicopter climb up.</p><h2 id="h127731"><a id=""></a>Where to find UFOs</h2><figure id="" data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the last and rarest of the bunch–the UFO. I’ve yet to see this one during an actual race, although it does appear randomly in the Free Roam mode. Keep an eye on the sky and you just might see this saucer with colorful lights hovering by. <strong>UFOs typically stay in motion, but following one for long enough will make it come down to the ground and allow you to drive into its tractor beam to take it over.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You don’t have to rely on luck to find one out in the wild. There is at least one UFO that remains idle in the Free Roam mode and resets after you’ve interacted with it. <strong>This stationary UFO can be found on a cliff overlooking the river between Dry Bones Burnout and Mario Bros. Circuit.</strong> More specifically, it’s on the cliff to the left of the great staircase that leads towards the Dry Bones Burnout area. Follow the mountainside left until you can drive up the slope and see a set of torches and a metal fence. Drive along the path to find the UFO, a couple of cows, and a Nabbit to catch.</p><p>Controls for the UFO are similar to the Helicopter, with the stick controlling both descension and ascension. One standout difference is that pressing the R button will enable the tractor beam. You can use this to pick up everything from other cars, coins, and even enemy NPCs.</p><p>Even if the open world can feel bare at times, <em>Mario Kart World</em> has a lot of fun interactables and secrets to discover. Keep exploring the environment and the tracks themselves! You never know where any large vehicles might be available.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-semi-truck-ufo-helicopter-1851786066]]></content:encoded>

And then I’ll ask them where the room is that contains all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766">(good) <em>Tony Hawk</em> games</a></span>. If heaven is truly paradise, a place where I’ll be happy forever, I expect <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. They are some of the best video games ever made, blending snappy controls, fun level design, and awesome music into an incredible skateboarding experience that I’ve always enjoyed since I was a young boy.</p><p>And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em></a></span>, the latest entry in the franchise, continues the franchise’s history of delivering pure, concentrated joy, one kickflip and combo at a time. Sure, some changes might ruffle feathers, and I ran into one too many bugs, but<em> THPS 3+4</em> overcomes its mistakes and has become one of my favorite games of 2025.</p><h2 id="h127843"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4?</em></strong></h2><p>If you’ve never played a <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>game before, let me explain how these things work. You have a collection of levels and each has goals, like score a high number of points or collect a certain number of items. You have two minutes to complete these goals, but you can try as many times as you like. Completing enough goals unlocks new levels to skate. Do everything you can, and you unlock more goals that are harder. </p><p>And that’s basically it. It’s a shockingly simple formula, but it works because it adds<em> just enough </em>tension. Each two-minute run is a mad dash to complete a specific goal, reach a certain area, or find that last item you desperately need. Every crash or mistake in a two-minute run in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> feels painful as you lose some time.</p><p>However, the two-minute timer, which was a key part of the first three games, wasn’t a feature in <em>THPS 4.</em> Instead, that game used a semi-open world structure, letting players complete various goals as they saw fit in bigger levels than those in past games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836">All of that is gone in the new remake</a></span>. As someone who didn’t play much <em>Pro Skater 4</em>, I don’t mind the remake taking levels from that game and remixing them into the classic two-minute format. But I also get that for some people, this is a huge change that ruins half of <em>THPS 3+4’</em>s package.</p><p><em>THPS 3+4</em> does offer the option to increase the run timer to as high as 60 minutes, which sort of recreates the laidback, open-world vibes of the original<em> THPS 4</em>, though it likely won’t be enough for people who consider the fourth entry in the skateboarding series their favorite.</p><p>It’s not just how you play the levels that has changed in the remake, as the very levels themselves have received big graphical updates, and here, the changes are almost all positive. All of the levels in<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>are filled with new details, high-res textures, and improved models, making them feel more alive than in the old games. But developer Iron Galaxy (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925">who worked on the PC port of <em>THPS 1+2</em></a></span>) was careful to make sure the classic levels still feel great to skate and aren’t too visually busy or messy. You can still clearly see ramps, rails, collectibles, and more. </p><p>This is key in a game where you are often moving very fast in the middle of some huge combo and have to make decisions with little time to think. I never experienced a moment in the remake where I was confused about a piece of the level or what was skateable.</p><h2 id="h127844"><a id=""></a><strong>Something new, please</strong></h2><p>Interestingly, Iron Galaxy has created three new levels in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> One is a large dilapidated waterpark, another a movie studio, and the other places you inside of a pinball machine played by Tony Hawk. </p><p>I was concerned that these levels might not be able to hold their own next to the classic parks. Thankfully, Iron Galaxy nailed it. The waterpark-themed area feels like something original <em>THPS </em>devs Neversoft (a studio killed by Activision) would have created back in the PS2 days. Likewise, the pinball level injects some more absurdity into the collection in a way I really appreciated and which is true to the series. I mean, the first game included an Area 51-like level with a UFO and an alien. Oh, and the pinball level includes a very nice nod to original devs Neversoft. Finally, the movie studio level feels so much like an original park that I forgot to include it in the first draft of this review. </p><p>Speaking of changes, <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’</em>s soundtrack isn’t just the same songs from the old games. Again, like the changes made to<em> THPS 4</em>’s levels, some fans won’t like that most of the old songs are gone. But they’ve been replaced by a soundtrack filled with bangers, including new songs from artists featured in the original <em>THPS 3</em> and <em>THPS 4. </em>It makes the package feel less like a nostalgic retread and more like a new game. It’s not. It’s still very much a remake, cashing in on nostalgia. But when I was playing one of the new parks, listening to new music, and playing as one of the many new skaters included in the game alongside old <em>THPS</em> vets, I found myself enjoying something I didn’t expect to have in 2025: A new <em>Tony Hawk</em> game. A good one, too. What a wonderful treat buried in this fantastic remake.</p><p>For fans who like to get creative, <em>THPS 3+4 </em>features a very powerful skatepark creator that lets you build basically any kind of level you want. And you can share them across all platforms, too. People are already recreating levels from other <em>Tony Hawk</em> games, and I’ve spotted at least one Mario-inspired track, too. If enough talented creators pick up <em>THPS 3+4</em>, I might have an endless number of new levels to skate, complete with custom goals and collectibles. The remake also supports online play. So you and a few friends can free skate together on a user-created remake of<em> Doom</em>’s E1M1. What a world we live in! There’s also a create-a-skater option, but these can’t be shared online.</p><h2 id="h127845"><a id=""></a><strong>Happiness is a skateboard</strong></h2><p>I’m realizing that I’m nearly done with this review, and I’ve not mentioned yet how skating feels in <em>THPS 3+4</em>. That’s because it’s just so perfect that I don’t have much to add beyond that. It takes what was created for <em>THPS 1+2 </em>and builds on it ever so slightly, but without breaking anything. Skating around a level, even in free skate mode with no goals or timers, is a joyful experience. It just feels so damn good. I always felt in control as I skated, and tricks felt snappy and responsive. Popping a random kickflip on my way to a goal never failed to make me feel a jolt of endorphins firing off in my brain. I have no notes to share about skating in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> It’s very good. It makes me happy. I love it.</p><p>What I don’t love are some of the bugs I encountered while playing <em>THPS 3+4</em>. None of them were game-breaking, but sometimes I’d have my screen go black or the camera get stuck in a weird spot. A quick level reset usually fixed these problems, but some screen tearing on Xbox continued to happen when booting up a level. Performance remained solid, but it was a small annoyance I spotted over and over. Hopefully, a future patch can fix some of these bugs and the tearing issue.</p><p>Even if the issues are never patched,<em> THPS 3+4 </em>is still a fantastic game. If you’ve enjoyed playing <em>Tony Hawk</em> games in the past, then you should check this thing out ASAP. While the changes to <em>THPS 4</em>’s levels might disappoint some, the new music and levels are rad, and the skating feels as perfect as ever. If that gaming room in heaven exists, it better have a copy of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4.</em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124]]></content:encoded>
