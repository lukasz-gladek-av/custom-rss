              <p><span>A year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the first one</span></a><span>, a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>new leak of documents and production concepts</span></a><span> has hit Game Freak and the contents are spreading across social media. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer has several upcoming games in the works, including a Generation X game, a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game set in Galar, and an MMO-style game that lets players explore multiple regions. But the leak isn’t just about the games that are on the way. We also learned a few interesting tidbits about older games and the inner workings of the company. While they may not be as exciting as “Generation X games will feature procedurally generated worlds,” here are a few takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Scarlet</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b><b>‘s DLC cost as much to make as a full game</b></h2> <p><span>I was pretty lukewarm on both of </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s DLC expansions, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Indigo Disk</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564"><i><span>Teal Mask</span></i></a><span> were such big projects that they ended up </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139"><span>costing as much as </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>‘ entire budget</span></a><span>. According </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977994754085253581"><span>to the leaks</span></a><span>, the add-ons sold around 6.15 million copies in the first 10 months, compared to the base </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s 27 million in sales. </span><i><span>Arceus, </span></i><span>meanwhile, moved roughly twice what the DLC did (14 million copies) at a higher price point, so Game Freak is looking to scale back budgets for its DLC packs to make the business model more sustainable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Development Budgets:</p> <p>– SV DLC: 500 million yen<br>– Legends 2/ZA: 2 billion yen<br>– Winds/Waves: 3 billion yen</p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779651352133635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another interesting fact about </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s DLC is that while the final product ended up taking place in Kitkami and the Blueberry Academy in Unova (</span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>), the original plan was to set them in Kalos (</span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>) and Alola (</span><i><span>Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pokémon Scarlet/Violet DLC was originally planed to be set in Kalos and Alola.</p> <p>We ended up getting Kitakami and Unova. <a href="https://t.co/V0gWImY9kB">pic.twitter.com/V0gWImY9kB</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779013339730404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><b>One of the original 151 nearly got a Gigantamax form</b></h2> <p><span>A big part of this leak was a swath of concept art for </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The 2019 Switch games introduced a new battle gimmick called Dynamaxing that allows players to temporarily transform their monsters into powerful kaijus under certain conditions. Every Pokémon could use this technique, but a select few were able to take on new forms entirely, called Gigantamax forms, once they grew to the size of a skyscraper. One of the original 151 Pokémon, the poison-type monster Nidoking, was at some point in development going to have one of these forms. He would have sported a red crown and beard, as well as a cape on his back. It would have really leaned into the “king” part of the Pokémon’s name, but it was scrapped. It’s unknown if its female counterpart, Nidoqueen, would have also received a similar form.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ygaYebF8Qw">pic.twitter.com/ygaYebF8Qw</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977816325335720063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <h2><b>Team Star had a much different look</b></h2> <p><span>Team Star, the antagonistic team in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, is a group of student outcasts who decided to turn all their anger on their fellow classmates. But it looks like the group was pretty different in the early concept stages. Leaked concept art shows several adult leaders in Team Star, rather than the school-aged crew we ended up facing in 2022. Some design motifs survived the iteration process, such as each member having a float/vehicle they pilot that caters to their different aesthetics, but overall, it seems like Team Star would have had a much different role if this version of the group had survived. One member has a biker/monster truck theme, another has a Wailmer-run boat, and there’s also a cunty-ass car being held up by several Togekiss. It looks like this would have been piloted by a dapper male character, and I wish I could have met this queen.</span></p>

Well, that doesn’t seem to be the case. At least, not yet. The documents in the leak make note of what the team wants for a future remake, but it’s not currently listed on any of Game Freak’s pipelines. Another developer could take on the project like ILCA did for </span><i><span>BDSP</span></i><span>, but for right now, I think we can safely assume that an eventual </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is a ways down the line.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Game Freak nearly made a Pokéwalker mobile app</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak had plans to create a PokéWalker app that would be compatible with </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This would have allowed you to take your Pokémon with you on your phone, play minigames, and even catch new monsters to send to your copy of </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The name “Pokéwalker” initially referred to a peripheral that was first introduced back in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span> as a pedometer you could clip onto your clothes or bag, and was essentially a virtual pet compatible with the DS games. It sounds like this would have served a lot of the same function, but without the manufacturing costs.</span></p>

The idea was to have two games, </span><i><span>Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Legends: Lugia</span></i><span>, rather than just the lone game like </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>have been. Like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>, these games would have been a period piece with a protagonist shot through time into historical Johto and seeing the beginnings of Pokémon trainers.

According to translations of Game Freak personnel documents, employees considered the period up to </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>to be largely dominated by Masuda and felt no one in the company could oppose him, leading to a “concentration of power” and disorganization within the studio. This eventually led to an argument between Masuda and character artist Ken Sugimori during the</span><i><span> X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> era, ultimately resulting in the company’s decision to remove Masuda from the director’s chair. Masuda has since stayed on as a producer and supervisor of mainline games, and was able to direct the remakes </span><i><span>Let’s Go, Pikachu</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Eevee</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> BDSP</span></i><span>. In 2022, Masuda left Game Freak for a role at the wider Pokémon Company, where he acts as Chief Creative Fellow.</span></p> <p><span>—</span></p> <p><span>More news is coming from this leak as we speak, so there might still be some major bombshells to come.

              <p>Of the many updates <i>No Man’s Sky</i> has received over the years, few have <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428">transformed the game</a> in the same way as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">recently released Voyagers update</a>. Arriving toward the end of last summer, the update allows players to construct ships on a scale never seen before in the game, complete with fully traversable interiors. It led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">wild original builds and recreations</a> of ships from legendary sci-fi franchises. Now, as spotted on Reddit recently, one player is looking to top them all with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1o683xa/someone_built_a_deathstar/">intimidating Death Star</a>.</p>   <p>Reddit user Even-Ad648 caught sight of the ominous orb of planet-destroying death in a <i>NMS</i> multiplayer game. And though it technically looks a bit smaller than the “real” thing would be, it’s nonetheless an impressive and grim-looking spectacle.</p>

 <p>Though you can create some impressive flying machines with <i>NMS</i>’ corvettes, this Death Star clearly uses some glitching to scale to the size of an in-world space station. And, according to Even-Ad648, the game crashed once they got too close. So I guess that rules out any death-defying close runs to exploit a structural vulnerability.</p> <p>Folks have made attempts to build Death Stars before. Some have struggled a bit to perfectly match the <a href="https://x.com/tuyosi723_pilot/status/1977671635256971341">spherical dimensions of the original</a>, but <a href="https://x.com/NoMansZine/status/1976211868017676486">others have made some decent efforts</a>. Still, there’s something eerie about that one in the Reddit vid. Fly safe out there, ya’ll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been three years since the last Pokémon games, <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. For the average player that might be a refreshing break, but for the hardcore fans that’s practically a lifetime. Does <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> deliver after all that waiting, or is it more of a stop-gap entry that feels overshadowed by how long overdue it is? According to early reviews it’s just good enough to reward fans’ patience, even if it’s not the mold-shattering standout in the<em> Pokémon</em> series some have been hoping for.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is currently hovering around 81 on <em><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Metacritic</a></em> with 40 reviews currently published. That’s a few points below 2022’s<em> Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> but a healthy bump up from the performance-issue-riddled <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. Most reviewers of the newest entry said it runs well on Switch 2 with no real graphical hitches and a solid 60fps performance throughout the game, though <em>VGC</em> reported that it still feels like the sequel is being held back by being developed on last-gen hardware as well.</p>

 <p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Z-A</em> trades <em>Arceus</em>‘ watercolor-esque wilderness for an urban labyrinth of streets, skyscrapers, and small public parks. Some reviewers found it visually boring, even if there are plenty of activities to keep the city of Lumiose feeling lively and entertaining. <em>Nintendo Life</em> was not impressed with the setting, calling the new urban playground “lifeless” and restrictive-feeling. What most early reviews seem to agree on is that<em> Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions, overhauled raids, and real-time hybrid combat subverts the standard flow of a <em>Pokémon</em> game in fun and interesting ways, making the battles a standout for the series.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that this is still just a small sample of the initial critical feedback for <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. Reviewers apparently only received code five days before today’s review embargo, and restrictions prohibit them from talking about certain parts of the game. It also doesn’t seem like anyone’s had an opportunity to test it on Switch 1 yet either, the platform that most fans will be playing it on. <em>Kotaku</em> will have its own coverage starting on the October 16 release date, but in the meantime here’s what else early reviews are saying about the newest Pokémon game.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><em>IGN</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>Man, I was going to try and hold back a bit on this review-in-progress since I still have plenty to see before my final review, but I’m just so genuinely excited about what Game Freak has done here. I liked <em>Arceus</em> a fair amount and thought it showed promise, but have been broadly disappointed with the slow backslide I saw from the studio in its move to console game development, and worried the quality dip was a new trend for 3D Pokémon games that we’d never escape. <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, at least across the first two-dozen hours, is putting a lot of my fears to rest. It’s not revolutionary by any stretch, but it’s really good! I’m having fun, I’m excited to keep playing, I feel rewarded for exploring every corner, the story’s got my attention, and I’m not distracted by my Pokémon falling through the floor while they battle or everything crashing when I try to climb a ladder. If the rest of my adventure holds up (and the Switch 1 performance isn’t a disaster), we could finally have a 3D game worthy of the Pokémon franchise on our hands. It’d be about dang time. — Rebekah Valentine (review-in-progress)</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Like the last three main series games before it,<em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> comes with hefty caveats. It gets repetitive after a while. It’s still visually limited, despite the huge improvements on the last pair. It’s still missing dungeons, deep mysteries, a sense of big challenge to build up to, prepare for and overcome. But then it has charm in spades, from [its] humour right through to its soundtrack (a smooth, jazzy, wistful, accordion-based treat). There’s even an <em>homage</em> to a dungeon, that feels if nothing else like a fantastic proof of concept for one day bringing them back in 3D. — Chris Tapsell</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>Crucially, living and breathing city life for an entire RPG means the return to Kalos feels like a true slice of life in the Pokemon world that you’re a part of. That dream sold to us by the Pokemon anime? It’s right here, clearer than it ever has been in the actual games, and it’s impossible not to get caught up in the joy of that as you wake up and leave your new residence of Hotel Z in a morning, wild Fletchling and Pidgey flying past and perching gently on streetlights as you run down the streets with your Pokemon by your side. The lack of regional adventure may not be to everyone’s taste, but if you’ve ever fantasized about living in the Pokemon world like I have, there’s a lot to love here. — Catherine Lewis</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18695-pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><em>RPG Site</em></a></h2> <blockquote> <p data-handler="v1">Where <em>Arceus</em> de-emphasized trainer battles and towns in lieu of exploring a Sinnoh region before wider settlements had been established,<em> Z-A</em> consolidates the entirety of its experience within the urban setting of Kalos’ Lumiose City. While an increasing number of Wild Zones dot Lumiose’s landmarks, by far the star of the show is trainer battles, primarily within the <em>Z-A</em> Royale; a tournament held every night in a rotating district, as trainers compete to raise their rank in pursuit of the promise of their wish being granted. — James Galizio</p> </blockquote> <figure></figure> <h2><em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Life</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>While I was wandering around the cobbles of Lumiose, I realized it all felt very compact. The city is essentially one big open zone, with a fair amount of verticality. But that means I’d run through and explored the entire place within about five hours. Sure, more Wild Zones unlock as you progress, bringing more Pokémon to catch. But it left very few surprises for the entire game.</p> <p>I also wish it looked better, too. Lumiose has a few lovely sights here and there, but on the whole, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> appears lifeless. <em>Arceus</em> wasn’t a graphical showcase, but that watercolor-style aesthetic gave it a really unique feel. <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> looks so much better and more vibrant than this. If clothes can swish around and hair flow through the wind, why can’t we have windows that aren’t just flat textures or shadows that don’t look like bleeding ink blotches on the floor? It’s a little better docked, but not much. — Alana Hagues</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"><em>VGC</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>The<em> Pokémon Legends</em> series feels like it’s settling old scores.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>&nbsp;allowed Game Freak to tell the epic story of <em>Arceus</em> (and finally have him easily catchable worldwide in a game), while also serving as a pseudo-remake/tribute to Generation 4 for those who didn’t love BDSP.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em> is a game that understands its audience and feels like a love letter to both players who grew up with X &amp; Y and those who’ve been here the whole time. Lumoise City is finally as grand as Game Freak tried to make it with the limited power of the 3DS, and Zygarde not only earns plenty of focus, but<em> Z-A</em> will likely propel it from total obscurity to a fan favorite. — Jordan Middler</p></blockquote>
