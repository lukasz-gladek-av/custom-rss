              <p>Despite a trade war and rising inflation, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">three-year-old Steam Deck</a> hasn‚Äôt gone up in price yet. In fact, it just got a pretty major discount. The $400 LCD model will be 20 percent off for the 2025 fall Steam sale. That makes it significantly cheaper than just about every other current-gen gaming device on the market right now, including the 8-year-old Nintendo Switch. It also puts some needed pressure on new PC gaming handhelds launching this holiday.</p> <p>The Steam Deck 256GB LCD model will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">$320 starting September 22</a>. That‚Äôs essentially what the refurbished model, currently out of stock, usually costs. The 512GB OLED model is still $550 and the 1TB OLED is still $650 (they come with slightly bigger screens, a higher refresh rate, and better battery life). This week-long discount leads into the Steam Autumn Sale which will kick off next week on September 29 and run until October 6.</p> <p>It‚Äôs not a bad deal at all for one of the most versatile gaming handhelds around. It might just be Valve clearing out old inventory as it phases out the older LCD models entirely, but it comes as every other platform squeezes players more and more at the checkout line. The Xbox Series X/S just got its second price hike this year, the PS5 all-digital is now $100 more than it was at launch, and even the original Switch recently went from $300 to $330. At this rate, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like the $450 Switch 2 might not be far behind.</p> <p>Then there‚Äôs the Steam Deck‚Äôs competition in the PC gaming handheld race. We still don‚Äôt know how much the new <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">Xbox Ally Rog</a> will be, even though it‚Äôs less than a month away from launch. And the Legion Go 2, which costs <a href="https://kotaku.com/legion-go-2-price-specs-madden-curse-eagles-2000623447">up to $1350 at the high end</a> ($1,479 for the 2TB model), is both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard-to-get. Lenovo took so many pre-orders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nl3vxj/now_there_cancelling_preorders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it‚Äôs already canceling some</a>. That all might be great for ‚Äú<a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html">enthusiast gamers</a>‚Äù but it‚Äôs not likely to actually help grow the overall market for PC gaming or handhelds. There‚Äôs only an estimated <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d49e77d2-93bb-48ce-b01b-168e092a9257?j=eyJ1IjoiN293Z2UifQ.yUVZMKoNk2BqBF9tq3iEKEd7X3capQ_E9zpEziCzGhc">5 to 7 million Steam Decks</a> out there in the world right now, and it‚Äôs by far the best-selling portable not made by Nintendo.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-told-me-one-of-the-biggest-games-on-the-planet-is-super-horny.1304676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes, in this line of work, a game‚Äôs name will pass over your feeds multiple times before you ever actually see a frame of footage from it. That is what happened to me with </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>, Papergames‚Äô 2024 dating sim, which apparently has over </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/virtual-romance-real-money-why-some-sporeans-spend-up-to-4-figures-to-find-love-in-deepspace"><span>50 million players worldwide</span></a><span>. The otome game has always been a massive success, but with each update, another wave of buckwild clips starts spreading around the internet. Finally, this morning, I had my first run-in with </span><a href="https://x.com/micheogyal21/status/1969965447274717448"><span>a </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>scene</span></a><span> so confounding and horny that I had to look into it further.</span></p> <p><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> has a surprisingly complex science fiction story in which the main character, a woman named and customized by the player, is a ‚Äúdeepspace hunter‚Äù who fights creatures called Wanderers, but she also, unbeknownst to her, has been reincarnated multiple times. In all these previous lives, she has met the game‚Äôs five love interests, and unlocking memories from those past iterations is one of the biggest draws of the game because they not only delve into the game‚Äôs broader mysteries, but they‚Äôre also, well, interactive.</span></p>  <p><span>Just taking a cursory look at some of the romance scenes, it‚Äôs easy to see why </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has taken off the way it has. It‚Äôs angsty, sexy (if a bit awkward), and it has the same tendency toward melodrama that you might find in a soap opera or a romance novel. People love to date digital men who fulfill an otherworldly fantasy that real men can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs why </span><i><span>Twilight </span></i><span>still has the cultural cache it does, despite having been out of the limelight for over a decade. That being said, even as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>well-documented lover of digital men</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-sex-romance-scene-neve-taash-1851696476"><span>romance</span></a><span>, I don‚Äôt think I have the patience for some of </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>‚Äôs gacha nonsense, which seems even more convoluted than that in your average gacha game. But even if I‚Äôm not playing it, I can still go snooping around YouTube and TikTok to see what all 50 million people who are playing this game are fawning over. Specifically, I needed to find out what the hell was up with this sex scene in which one of the lover boys, Zayne, says, ‚ÄúFeel this and remember what I‚Äôm giving you‚Äù as he‚Äôs on top of the player character.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FEEL THIS POWER OF ANNIHILATION HE SAID, ANNIHILATE MA KITTY [zayne new myth god of annihilation] <a href="https://t.co/ATSKlGpwaY">pic.twitter.com/ATSKlGpwaY</a></p> <p>‚Äî ùíîùíñùíõùíñ (@pinkcrispss) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkcrispss/status/1969964067986268598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The scene is from a new trailer for the ‚ÄúEdge of Continuum‚Äù event that will begin on September 25. Edge of Continuum features new scenes with a ‚ÄúGod of Annihilation‚Äù version of Zayne, depicting one of the protagonist‚Äôs many lives alongside him. And damn, the trailer is enough to get someone hot and bothered.</span></p>  <p><span>I‚Äôm surprised at how much story the trailer gives away, but nobody in the comments seems to be that mad about it, considering what they also get to see, which is basically the beginnings of a fantasy-themed softcore porn starring Zayne. Happy for y‚Äôall, and I have nothing but respect for those of you who can fight your way through the gacha nonsense to reach these scenes. Hopefully, I‚Äôve done enough research for writing this that the algorithm starts showing me more of this shit so I can enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span></p>

              <p>Having a work-from-home job doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you need to always be working&nbsp;<em>from home</em>. You feasibly have the power to work from anywhere in the world so long has you have stable Wi-Fi. The thing that used to get in the way of me getting out more often with my laptop is that I don‚Äôt like working off just my laptop screen. At my desk, I have spoiled myself with three large monitors and can see everything I‚Äôm working on at once. On my laptop, I‚Äôm caught flipping through endless tabs and apps, losing track of what I‚Äôm looking at constantly. But now, I have gotten myself a portable monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">You can too as this one from ASUS just dropped on Amazon from $209 to just $169. That 19% discount will save you a solid $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Out More</h2>
<p>For the worker that wants to get out and about more, ASUS‚Äô portable monitor is perfect at it‚Äôs 15.6-inch display size. If you decide to head over to your local coffee shop or maybe get some work done in your hotel room while traveling, you can simulate your desktop experience, being able to view more of what you want to have access to at once. You can have the spreadsheet your building out on one display while you have your email or Slack opened up on the second as not to miss any pings coming your way. Or instead you can mute any incoming notifications and use your second monitor to watch the latest episode of&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em> while putting slides together for your next presentation on the first one.</p>
<p>The ASUS monitor has a built-in kickstand, making it easy to prop up. It can be setup in either landscape or portrait mode. I‚Äôm a big champion of the vertical display. Having your email or slack set up vertically just makes more sense than landscape. You can see more of your messages at once and be able to read more of those longwinded emails before you need to scroll down again.</p>



<p>The monitor supports a hybrid-signal, meaning the USB-C allows for the transmission of both video and power. This is wonderful because it means you‚Äôll have less cables running across your workspace. It just needs the one USB-C cable connected from your laptop and that‚Äôs enough to turn on the portable ASUS monitor and send the video feed to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">If you want to use the ASUS monitor as a more permanent secondary monitor,</a> you‚Äôll be happy to learn it is tripod hold compatible, letting you mount the display.</p>

              <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was one of 2022‚Äôs break-out indie successes, a crudely animated 2D auto-shooter in which you moved your&nbsp;<em>Castlevania-</em>inspired character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you played, the more characters you unlocked and the more skills would became available as you leveled up. Now meet <em>Megabonk</em>, a 2025 indie success, a crudely animated 3D auto-shooter in which you move your character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you play, the more characters you unlock and the more skills become available as you level up.</p> <p>The absolutely blatant way in which <em>Megabonk</em> takes inspiration from <em>Vampire Survivors </em>doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing it any harm. Then again, the most played games in the world <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">are <em>Roblox-</em>made knock-offs</a>, so no big surprises there. Oh, and quite importantly,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is a ton of fun to play. I mean, a 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> sounds like it would be, right? Also, to be scrupulously fair, this game from first-time developer vedinad does have some of its own original ideas‚Ä¶if you look hard enough.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627600" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627600"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627600">¬© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Megabonk</em>, you move your chosen character (at the start you can choose between a nimble fox with a starting fireball and a clunky armored knight with a swingy sword) around the PS2-like 3D space, with enemies pinging into existence all around you. Much like in <em>VS</em>, you then learn how to move around in a way that‚Äôs appropriate for your attacks while trying to shepherd the crowd of enemies chasing you such that you can loop around and pick up the gems dropped by those you‚Äôve killed. Gather enough of these and you‚Äôll level up, and be able to pick from three randomly selected upgrades; a mix of new attacks, improvements for current ones, and various ‚Äútomes‚Äù that improve your defensive skills.</p>

 <p>Scattered around the land are vases to break for extra coins and gems, treasure chests that can be opened by spending coins and which then grant you a randomly selected bonus item), and stone pillars that, when stood near for long enough, will improve something like health regen, knockback efficacy, spawning times for elite enemies, that sort of thing. It‚Äôs about trying to maintain your health bar for as long as you can, before losing everything and returning to the main screen. Here, if you‚Äôve managed to gather enough silver coins or reached certain milestones (killed 1,000 skeletons, say), you can unlock new characters, weapons and tomes.</p>

 <p>Which, yes, pretty much entirely describes&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>. But here you can jump! And glide!</p> <p>For all I mock, I‚Äôm having a good time with it. It‚Äôs difficult enough from the start that it makes you want to keep finding those incremental improvements‚Äîthat‚Äôs a mistake a lot of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones make (and let‚Äôs not forget, there have been&nbsp;<em>so many</em> of them over the last three years), where things are too easy near the start, so you get too far into your early runs before difficulty ramps up, making it feel laborious to go through it over and over. But here, as in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, I‚Äôm finding there‚Äôs a sense of strategy in seeking the things that let me improve each run.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627602">¬© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In fact, if anything it‚Äôs just how, er, ‚Äúfaithfully‚Äù&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> sticks to the&nbsp;<em>VS</em> formula that is the secret of its success. So many knock-offs sensibly attempt to add their own twists, but too many of those break the formula. It‚Äôs perhaps not exactly high praise to point out how <em>Megabonk</em>‚Äòs lack of originality helps it succeed, but it remains true.</p>

 <p>Despite costing twice as much as&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> (which is still an extraordinary $5),&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is proving that success in player numbers. While it‚Äôs not exactly troubling the tops of the charts, 20,000 concurrent players for a first-time dev‚Äôs crude-looking indie game is no small feat, and it only released at the end of last week. The game‚Äôs already hitting that number today, and the U.S. has barely woken up, so it seems this game is still growing. It‚Äôs also boosted by glowing Steam reviews, with the game bathing in 91 percent positive ratings, affording it the highly coveted ‚ÄúOverwhelmingly Positive‚Äù label. It‚Äôs that combination of a winning formula (albeit somebody else‚Äôs) and a massive amount of luck that lets Steam games occasionally see this sort of buzz. And what a treat for the developer, whomever they may be‚Äîaccording to their BlueSky, the game had sold over 100,000 copies by the end of the weekend.</p>   <p>That‚Äôs life-changing money, and you love to see it.</p> <p>And yes, of course there have been other 3D <em>VS</em> reimaginings, not least last year‚Äôs FPS incarnation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206270/Vampire_Hunters/"><em>Vampire Hunters</em></a>, but it‚Äôs so interesting when something catches the zeitgeist in this way. It‚Äôs even more satisfying when the resulting game is a bunch of fun to play, too. Even if poncle might feel like he‚Äôs owed a couple of bucks as a result.</p>
