              <p>2025 is very much shaping up to be the year for the return of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401">Mega-Evolved Pokémon</a>. While GameFreak is being frustratingly tight-lipped about which mega pocket monsters will be appearing in this October’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682/15#content">we do already know that Mega Dragonite</a> will be making its weird-ass mutant debut in the game. At the same time, September will see the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> start a new era of cards, returning to the enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-mega-evolution-leak-lucario-latias-1851786474">Mega Pokémon designs</a> and presumably some new beasts there too. But can you cuddle any of those? No ma’am, you cannot. So thank goodness for <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/new-releases">the Pokémon Center’s new range of plushies</a>.</p> <p>Eight new plushies have been added to the store, featuring both fan-favorites and a couple of more obscure choices. The most important thing is, yes, there’s Mega Gengar and Mega Gardevoir. But personally, I’m most excited to see Mega Mawile, because it’s so spectacularly bonkers.</p> <p>Each new plush costs a pretty steep $40, and are roughly about 11 to 13 inches tall or wide (obviously they vary, given the shape of the Pokémon, so Mega Lucario stands almost 16″ tall, but is narrow). And based on what amounts to an embarrassing degree of personal experience (I’ve lost count of how many Pokémon plushies I’ve bought, but it certainly falls under “too many”), Pokémon Center cuddly toys tend to be made to extraordinarily high standards. They really seem to be exquisitely well made, although you’d hope so given the premium prices. And yeah, stop judging me, but I’m absolutely buying the Mega Mawile.</p> <p>I’ve put images of each of the eight Megas in the following gallery, to see if you can be tempted too. And think fast—I don’t imagine Mega Gengar will stay in stock for long.</p>
