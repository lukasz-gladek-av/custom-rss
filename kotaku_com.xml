        <p><span>Developing games is hard and unpredictable, and marketing them is no different. Sometimes companies make decisions they later regret. Maybe you had a bunch of splashy reveals made announcing one release date, only for a last-minute change to throw things into disarray. Maybe an opportunity presents itself, one that feels too good to pass up, and you shift your entire approach to accommodate it. Sometimes that doesn’t work out either.</span></p> <p><span>The plan had always been to shadowdrop </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, a multiplayer hero shooter developed by&nbsp;</span><span>Wildlight Entertainment, a studio made up of ex-Respawn Entertainment heavyweights. It’s a strategy that benefitted </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> rival that came out of nowhere and quickly muscled its way into the competitive live-service gaming landscape. So why did Wildlight Entertainment decide to drop a trailer revealing the game for the first time at the Game Awards, knowing the team would go radio silent again immediately afterwards?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Look, we always planned for a, you know, a surprise release,” studio cofounder Chad Grenier told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> at a preview event earlier this month. “Geoff came in and wanted to do something special and put us in the TGAs. We were gonna do a shadowdrop, you know, since day one, almost since forming this company; we did it with </span><i><span>Apex </span></i><span>and it worked well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Wildlight decided to close gaming’s biggest event of the year with a trailer that left some intrigued but others unimpressed. It was a gamble that ricocheted out across social media in unpredictable ways, with mini-drama cycles sprouting up around the lack of any new information surrounding the game ahead of its January 26 launch. Some even theorized it might secretly get delayed after the poor reaction to the first trailer.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663151" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663151"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663151">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“We’ve known Geoff for a long time, and he said, ‘let me do something,’ that’s maybe a little risky in hindsight<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->but different, [to] take a free to play PvP Raid Shooter and do something with it,” Grenier said. “So we rushed a trailer together. I wish the reception had been better, but in hindsight we made a trailer to entertain really quickly, and didn’t show the gameplay loop, and what’s different and unique.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite the online noise, the team stayed quiet. The next time players saw<em> Highguard</em> it would be live and be able to speak for itself. It’s a tough call. With multiplayer releases, a game lives or dies based on whether it can find a big enough audience; while </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is free to play, meaning that there’s very little barrier to entry, the odds are still stacked against it. At the preview event where I spoke to members of the team, it was impossible to miss the mix of pride and trepidation about the game’s first proper appearance to the press and influencers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“So here we are. We’re launching the game now, and the team is resilient and enthusiastic,” Grenier said. “They’ve made a ton of games in their careers; we’ve seen the highs and the lows. I think, ultimately, we believe wholeheartedly in what we’ve created.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> was one of a number of media outlets and content creators invited to a launch event for </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> in Los Angeles, California on January 21. It’s part hero shooter, part MOBA, part MMORPG raid. Players descend upon the map, race around to collect gear and resources, and ultimately battle over a special artifact that must be deployed inside the enemy team’s base in order to win. It can’t be a lot to wrap your head around.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Heading into the event, I had very little idea of what to expect. While Wildlight includes developers who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, this is the studio’s debut project</span><i><span>. </span></i><span>Co-founder Grenier and Dusty Welch described the shift to independence as ultimately freeing but noted that about 60 percent of the team’s roughly 100 staff previously worked together at Respawn, eliminating some of the challenges of building up an entirely new team.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663155">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“When Chad and I left and started this company, it was to reunite a group of people,” Welch said. “Like, Chad and [Creative Director Jason McCord] have worked together for 17 years. Chad was my game director on </span><i><span>Apex</span></i><span>; we’ve worked together for quite a long time, and we have 60, 61 people from </span><i><span>Apex</span></i><span> that are working here on a 100-person team. So we wanted to create an environment and a place that was a home to experience the best of game making to our ability.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>He continued, “That home, that freedom to find new, fun things was great<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->with none of the burns, and none of the blockers, and none of the oversight and the baggage that comes with some of the places that we’ve worked, or the experiences we’ve had.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Wildlight is a “remote first” studio. While Dusty and Chad left Respawn during COVID, </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> was developed by a team that already had experience working remotely. The co-founders also made one other thing clear about how they see the team; while they’re aiming for that “AAA” game polish, they stress that they consider themselves an independent developer with all of the pain points that can entail. Wildlight is self-publishing the game. There’s no massive company to offer QA support or provide a marketing machine. </span><i><span>Apex </span></i><span>had EA. This time they’re on their own.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a fresh start, which is a good opportunity in a lot of ways, but it can take a while to get things up and going at the speed you were accustomed to,” Grenier said. “Luckily, it’s offset by what needs to happen anyways, which is just a lot of long discussions about what we’re making here. So, you’ll have some people working on tech while these long design discussions are happening, and they kind of go hand in hand<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->but, you know, it’s hard. We don’t have a big publisher to give us anything or help us in any way. We’re very much on our own and learning new things that we’ve never had to do ourselves before.”</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s nothing simple about designing a multiplayer shooter in 2026 either. Creative Director Jason McCord, as well as </span><i><span>Higuard</span></i><span>‘s Lead Game Designer Carlos Pineda, spoke to some of the challenges and inspirations that guided the studio in its early days<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->including some of the core inspirations behind what would ultimately become </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>‘s unique gameplay loop. The team wanted it to be something that stood out, so the game wasn’t just discarded as yet another free-to-play PvP shooter.</span></p> <p><span>“At the beginning, making the new game…we don’t know what the game is yet. We’re asking ourselves, what is it?” Pineda said. “What’s a game that we could make that people are gonna care about? Something that they’re not just gonna brush off like ‘it’s just another game.’ So we knew we had to not be one of those popular genres, not a battle royale or an extraction shooter.”</span></p> <p><span>The answer ended up lying in an unlikely place. “One day, I walked into the office and was like, hey, have you played </span><i><span>Rust</span></i><span>?” Pineda said.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663153">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>’s ambitious goal became distilling the feeling of raiding bases in the popular survival crafting sim, but without the time-intensive preamble of gathering resources and building up small fortresses. Eventually the core concept of the Shieldbreaker, the object that players would fight over to decide who would be raiding who, was born. The entire design process was centered around finding the right balance of maintaining the energy of those shootouts while keeping match time manageable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At one point in development, victory was determined by fully destroying an enemy Keep. Eventually, the team settled on detonating bombs at objectives like in </span><i><span>Counter-Strike</span></i><span> to streamline things instead. The decision to increase the rarity of gear salvaged with each successive round until a winner had been crowned came as a result of matches during playtesting devolving into menial back-and-forth tug-of-wars that would lose their spark. For a similar reason, the team eventually opted to give the Shieldbreaker a time limit before it automatically activates on the closest Keep.</span></p> <p><span>The team’s passion for the project is infectious, even as the anxiety about the looming launch is plain to see on their faces. McCord tells me about the story behind the axe, and how it ended up serving as both a means of gathering resources and a combat tool. Carlos explains how the “momentum problem” was only really solved in 2025, over three years into development. It stands out to me how open the team has been about the struggles they went through developing </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, a game they’ve worked on for years but whose fate is at the mercy of a fickle and chaotic online audience.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We put our heads down and listened and paid attention to what was going on and took it to heart,” Grenier said. “But we stayed silent because we knew that the first time, the next time that we say anything to the audience, it better be the game and let the game speak for itself.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Despite its big reveal at the Game Awards last month where it had the coveted “one last thing” slot, nobody outside of the development team had any idea what to expect from </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> as we sat down to play several hours of the game at a launch event in Los Angeles. All we knew was that the team, Wildlight Entertainment, had christened it a “PvP Raid Shooter,” a term that meant close to nothing without knowledge of what the gameplay itself is like. Half a week later, I’m here to tell you that I understand what sort of game it is, and how it won me over.</span></p> <p><span>Getting the inevitable out of the way, </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is a PvP hero shooter in which each match can be roughly divided into three disparate segments. At the start, players choose their characters, called “Wardens,” each with their own secondary ability and ultimate, and vote to select one of four “Keeps” which will act as the home base they must defend. Each base features three points of interest which the enemy team will want to destroy by planting bombs—think </span><i><span>Counter-Strike—</span></i><span>and at the start of each round teams are given a minute to choose which sections to prioritize for reinforcement with their limited resources. It’s a deceptively short amount of time; a trend that the rest of the gameplay loop follows through with.</span></p>

 <p><span>Keeps can have radically different layouts, each one representing a set of trade-offs that make the choice meaningful. “Hellmouth” comes suspended over lava, making movement for both defenders and raiders considerably more restrictive; “Bellringer” instead goes for a more open floor plan, buoyed by multiple towers and a central zipline. It’s easier to traverse, but leaves defenders and raiders alike out in the open as they make their way to their objective. Just a handful of hours is far from enough to come to grips with the quirks of every Keep in the game, but it’s fair to say that each of the ones I competed on felt unique both visually and in terms of game feel.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663141" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663141"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663141">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Once the initial timer lifts, players ride out of their keep into the wider map in search of resources; armor, weapons, additional material to reinforce sections of your Keep, and accessories for your Warden as well as saddles to buff your mount. Players have several minutes to prepare before the “Shieldbreaker”—the flag—spawns, and everyone collapses on the same central location marked on the map via a storm cloud. Once it spawns, the game becomes Capture the Flag, with the twist that you’re meant to bring the Shieldbreaker to the opposing team’s base to damage its health and knock down its shields to start a raid. Once the Shieldbreaker has been planted, the defending team has some time for last-minute preparations, as a Siege Tower appears that will act as the opposing team’s spawn point for the duration of the raid.</span></p>

 <p><span>On paper it’s a lot to explain, yet in practice it’s all surprisingly intuitive. Developer Wildlight was formed by folks who had worked on </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>, and that lineage is apparent in the feel of </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>; while it’s a weightier, more deliberate experience than those games, it still fits like a glove with some excellent-feeling gunplay and responsive controls. The user interface is polished and immediately readable and the game’s art direction is rather strong, with a ton of heart. Scattered across the game’s maps and at each team’s spawn point is Flynn, the shopkeep who can exchange resources mined from the environment for gear, and always has a delightful cross-eyed Owlbear Koala called Gregory by his side.</span></p>

 <p><span>Wardens, too, showcase a lot of personality in action. Kai’s ability to conjure ice walls and send them slamming forward into enemies is delightful enough on its own, but what was even more memorable was some of his banter with other Wardens about his ultimate ability that lets him shapeshift into a frost giant. I wasn’t able to see too many of these conversations between characters, but the ones that I managed to witness ultimately helped endear them to me.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Wardens come with their own set of kits. Some are more suited for defense, like Una who can summon spirits which lob grenades at enemies in their line of sight. Others excel at subterfuge; Scarlet, for instance, has the ability to shift destructible walls into sand, allowing her to pass through the environment while minimizing the sound left in her wake. Every Warden I tested felt laser-focused on what role they’re meant to fill during a match; watching players learn exactly what those archetypes are over the course of the day was one of the most enjoyable moments of the whole experience.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663142"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663142">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Throughout the launch event, the devs stressed that they wanted to avoid matches that stall out for hours on end; at most, </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>‘s games are designed to last 30 minutes. Even then, chances are the average will clock in at closer to 15 to 20 minutes. Each time a team successfully defends against a raid, the whole loop starts over again with a twist; the rarity level of gear increases, and weapons and tools alike gain additional perks. A sniper might become full-auto, a shotgun’s reload speed might be reduced, or a zipline gun might cloak anyone riding the ziplines it sets. When the Shieldbreaker is active, if it hasn’t been set after a few minutes the match will shift to Sudden Death in order to force the issue. If that’s not enough, it will automatically activate on the closest base if enough time has elapsed.</span></p> <p><span>It’s an interesting philosophy, and in practice it means that even in matches where both teams trade blows it never feels like you’re at a standstill. Whether those feelings will last after dozens or even hundreds of games remains to be seen, but for now it lends </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> a brisk energy that I didn’t really expect from such an involved gameplay loop. Certainly it accomplishes Wildlight’s stated goal of making something truly unique for the genre; it does feel like a breath of fresh air, even if individual elements are stuff we’ve seen time and again.</span></p> <p><span>My first look at the game, made the poor reception to its reveal sting all the more. </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>has spent the last several weeks being the butt of the internet’s jokes, and it leaves me wondering if players will give it the chance it probably deserves. It’s easy for a developer to claim that they’ve developed something truly new for a genre, and at the same time it’s equally rare for a studio to deliver on that promise. </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> well and truly feels like something special, and like </span><i><span>Titanfall </span></i><span>before it I could see it garnering a rabid fanbase. I just hope it’s afforded that chance.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136]]></content:encoded>
