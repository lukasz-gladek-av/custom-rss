            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re cruising right toward the the end of 2025 which means we’re in the thick of the holiday season and we’ve got lots of gift shopping to take care of. You can hold out until Black Friday or Cyber Monday in order to saver some cash, but right now, if you know where to look, you can find some pretty lucrative deals ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>For instance, Amazon has the popular portable power station — the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 — currently on sale for 55% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/">1500W AC battery normally goes for $839 and this discount brings it down to just $386</a>. This bundle also includes an AC cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is a great product to keep on hand in the back or your car or in your garage in the event of an emergency. You find yourself without power, perhaps during a thunderstorm causing a blackout, you can rely on this backup battery to keep your phones charged or to power important appliances.</p>
<p>On the subject of charging phones, the Jackery Explorer 1000 vs power station is capable of refueling your mobile devices up to 7.5 times faster the first generation model. With its six ports, you can even keep six different devices charged at once. This way, everyone in the family is covered in an emergency.</p>
<p>The six ports include<strong> three standard outlets which provide AC 1500W pure sine wave power</strong>. Then we have two USB-C ports, one able to produce 100W while the other does 30W. Then there’s the USB-A port capable of 18W.</p>



<h2>Fast-Charging</h2>
<p>When it comes time to actually recharging the Jackery power station itself, charging with standard settings will have it back up to capacity from zero in just 1,7 hours. If you need something a little faster than the default mode, you can actually set it to emergency super charging mode using the companion app on your phone. On this setting, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is able to get back up to 100% in just one hour.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t need it charged super fast and you’re more concerned about the noise it’s making. Set it to quiet charging mode which will bring it down to barely 22dB, letting it slowly recharge over five hours. You can also choose to purchase the optional solar panels which open you up to even more charging options. The panels can be used to recharge it in just three hours.</p>
<p>The battery is built to last. The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 will be able to provide you with roughly 4,000 cycles of recharging in its life. This is estimated to work out to about 10 years of use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies-2000641696</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies.1346440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limiting, especially when you need to work on multiple applications at once or share the display with others. Adding a full-size second monitor isn’t an option for everyone, but you can consider investing in a portable display that offers that extra space without the bulk.</p>
<p>Most portable monitors out there are quite affordable, with prices starting at $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less. Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/">15.6-inch <em>Yxk</em> portable screen for just $39, thanks to a 33% discount off its regular $59 price</a>. If you’ve been looking for a budget-friendly way to upgrade your work or play setup, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Consistent Visuals From All Angles</h2>
<p>The display itself measures 15.6 inches, which is the same size as most standard laptops. You’re getting a 1080p Full HD IPS screen with HDR support for clear, vibrant visuals with exceptional color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle ensures consistency from all angles, so you will be able to view the content clearly even when you’re not sitting directly in front of the screen. This also makes it easier to share the screen with others, as everyone won’t have to huddle around a single spot uncomfortably.</p>



<p>Long work sessions will no longer be tough on the eyes, thanks to Low Blue Light technology that actively reduces the amount of blue light emitted from the screen. Even better, you can choose between several display modes (mirror, extend, or second screen only) based on what you’re working on. Maybe go for the second screen mode when you need to work on different apps simultaneously, and the mirror mode while presenting! There are also two built-in speakers that make sure audio comes through clearly.</p>
<p>In terms of connectivity, it has two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini HDMI, meaning you can connect it to a range of devices, including laptops, phone, Xbox, PC, etc. The built-in stand makes it easy to set it up literally anywhere, from desk to bed.</p>
<p>Despite the generous size and power, the monitor weighs just 1.43 lbs and is only 0.31 inches thick. It slips into your laptop bag without bulking things up – ready to go where you do! Note that the discount ends soon, so it’s best to snag one for yourself before that happens.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aiming-for-perfection-as-ceo-references-past-metacritic-scores-over-95-2000641842</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-aiming-for-%E2%80%98perfection%E2%80%99-as-ceo-references-past-metacritic-scores-over-95.1346407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you heard the news? <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> has been delayed again</a>. The open-world crime simulator is no longer releasing in May 2026 and will now instead launch in November 2026. So why the delay? According to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, it’s because Rockstar Games is seeking “perfection” and the studio’s Metacritic track record is proof that this strategy works.</p> <p>During a November 6 earnings call, Zelnick, who leads Rockstar parent Company Take-Two, was asked about how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>GTA 6</em> delay</a> was affecting the studio and what Rockstar Games was doing at this stage in development. While Zelnick declined to get into the “inner workings” of the developer, he did talk about the company’s culture and focus on making critically acclaimed games.</p>

 <p>“I think the culture of Rockstar [Games] is extraordinary, and we’re all pushing hard to to seek perfection,” said Zelnick during the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251106169372/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Second-Quarter-2026">earnings call.</a> Take-Two’s stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/take-two-gta-vi-delay.html">sank around 7 percent</a> after news of the delay was made public. The CEO then praised how highly rated Rockstar-developed games are on review aggregator Metacritic.</p>

 <p>“I mean, the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally, speaking, not generally I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95,” explained Zelnick.&nbsp; “<em>GTA V</em>, as you know, has been the standard bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through three console generations, and to this day, is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite [being more than a] decade old, and that doesn’t happen by accident.”</p>

 <p>I’d quibble a bit here and point out that only seven of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/company/rockstar-games/?sort-options=score">Rockstar’s video game releases have hit 95 and only 4 got a higher score on Metacritic</a>, with most landing in the high 80s and low 90s. But there’s no denying that over the last 15 years Rockstar Games has mostly produced critically acclaimed blockbusters like <em>Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption II.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Zelnick added that Rockstar and all of Take-Two’s studios are focused on “seeking excellence, teamwork and kindness.” Not sure how reported efforts at union busting factor into that, but it’s a nice sentiment.</p> <p>Of course, the problem is that with each passing year and each delay, the expectations for <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> grow and grow. The video game industry isn’t standing still and waiting for Rockstar to make the next big open-world masterpiece. The genre has continued to evolve thanks to games like <em>Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry, Tears of the Kingdom, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5,</em> and others. What people expect from a big, AAA open-world video game has changed a lot since 2013’s <em>GTA V</em> and 2019’s<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Will Rockstar’s pursuit of “perfection” make it harder for the studio to keep up with the rest of the industry, leading to a game that feels dated? Or will the studio innovate and help reshape the genre it practically created? We’ll find out in November 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-ceo-strauss-zelnick-2000641798">Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Corded, heavy, and noisy vacuum cleaners should really be a thing of the past by now. If you’re still dragging one of these around every morning, wondering who ever said cleaning was therapeutic, it’s probably time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Dyson has some of the best options out there, and right now, one of its latest models just hit its lowest price ever. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/">Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum cleaner is now going for just $269 on Amazon, after a massive 55% discount</a>. It comes with multiple attachments to tackle different spaces, and does its job without waking the whole house up. This early Black Friday deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it ends soon. Get your orders in before the price goes back up to $599, or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5380/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cleans Multiple Surfaces Like a Pro</h2>
<p>This vacuum is Dyson’s most lightweight model yet, meaning you won’t be left with sore arms after a session. It comes with a whole set of attachments that include a crevice tool, a hair screw tool, a Motorbar cleaner head, and a combination tool; one for every type of surface and mess. The Motorbar cleaner head automatically adjusts to different floor types and is built to de-tangle hair as it cleans. <strong>V9’s high-velocity motor spins at up to 120,000rpm to generate up to 100 Air Watts</strong> of powerful suction, so expect it to handle even the most stubborn dirt and debris like a pro.</p>



<p>You can choose between three cleaning modes based on what you’re tackling; Eco, Med, and Boost. A <strong>single charge gets you up to 40 minutes of runtime</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to sweep through a couple of rooms, plus the living area. There’s a bright LCD screen on top that keeps you in the loop about remaining run time, current power mode, filter maintenance reminders, etc.</p>
<p>Best of all, the <strong>vacuum easily converts into a handheld</strong> for when you need to clean stairs, car seats, upholstery, etc. Once you’re done cleaning, simply press the eject button to empty the dirt into the bin. Then, you can drop it into the wall-mounted charging dock, and it will be ready for the next cleaning session in no time!</p>
<p>This is the lowest price we have seen this new model drop to. On a regular day, it would run you around $599, but you can grab it for $269 if you’re quick.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> stars Captain America and Black Panther during World War II and is written by Amy Hennig, one of the masterminds behind the <em>Uncharted g</em>ames. It’s also not coming out anytime soon. It’s been delayed again and doesn’t have a new release window this time.</p> <p>“<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em> is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect,” Skydance Games announced <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986539089164972440%7Ctwgr%5E56ccbf8232d563aa478d6ce3a863eaaa720620aa%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">on X</a> on Thursday while everyone was preoccupied <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787">with other game delay news</a>. “To fully realize our vision for <em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>, we’ve made the decision to shift our release window beyond early 2026.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important update regarding MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. <a href="https://t.co/y3WRSjVmds">pic.twitter.com/y3WRSjVmds</a></p> <p>— Skydance Games (@SkydanceGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Rise of Hydra</em> was originally supposed to ship in holiday 2025. Then in May of this year, Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">announced it would be pushed back</a> to early 2026 so the team could add more “polish.” At this point it seems like there’s more than just additional polish that’s needed.</p>

 <p>For anyone who hasn’t been following the project, <em>Rise of Hydra</em> takes place in Occupied Paris and is based on the limited comic book series <em>Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers</em>. The action-adventure sports a team-up between Steve Rogers, Azzuri, Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones, and Wakandan spy chief Nanali.</p>

  <p>The game was first confirmed back in 2021, teased at the D23 Expo in 2022, and finally received a full Unreal Engine 5 trailer in 2024. Skydance has been hyping the cast and the cinematics looked great but we’ve yet to see any real gameplay or get a real sense of the caliber of the game. But it would be cool if a new game Hennig worked on <a href="https://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660">finally got to actually come out</a>.</p> <p>It’s also the only <em>Black Panther</em> game we’re likely to get for some time. EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">canceled its own</a> and shut down the studio making it. Things were very different when <em>Rise of Hydra</em> was first greenlit as well. Hopefully it arrives before too much longer. Just maybe not during fall 2026.</p>

<p>Your gear determines much of your success while playing a game of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, but so do your skills. The game chops up 45 different skills across three trees, with most skills improving your general mobility and speed, as well as your ability to loot.</p> <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>But with so many choices, it’s easy to get lost. So let me share with you my thoughts on which skills are most beneficial, based on my 60 hours with the game.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, however, that I’m primarily a solo player, and my choices have often been made with that in mind. And while I don’t shy away from gunfights, I’m a fan of stealth games, so I’m often sneaking around on maps like Sam Fisher. I’ve also not yet weighed in on which of the skills at the very ends of the skill trees are best. The game is still young, so metas have yet to be solidified. Still, you can’t go wrong with the options I’ve laid out here.</p>

 <h2><span id="skill-tree-basics"></span>Skill tree basics<span></span></h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has a level cap of 75. You get 1 XP per level, which you can invest in a skill tree that covers 45 different skills distributed across three main branches. You can sink multiple points into many of these skills. So, no, you can’t unlock everything in the tree. You also can’t respec easily (you’ll have to wipe your character to do so by completing a project, which requires a ton of loot and has a specific timed window in which to send your character off).</p>

 <h2><span id="10-universally-great-skills-for-(almost)-every-playstyle%e2%80%93solo-or-grouped-up"></span>10 universally great skills for (almost) every playstyle–solo or grouped up<span></span></h2> <p>There are a ton of different ways to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>, with various guns and gadgets to help you live out the fantasy of a sniper, grenadier, shotgunner, or even freerunner.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">So Much Happens In A Single Hour Of&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>Still, there are some skills that will benefit just about anyone. At a minimum, everyone should invest at least one skill point into each of the starting points of each three. For Mobility that’s “Nimble Climber,” which lets you climb and vault faster. For Conditioning that’s “Used to the Weight,” which lets you move faster while wearing heavier shields. And for Survival, “Agile Croucher” lets you move faster while crouching.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734#comments"><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>Has A Big Roadmap And A New Update But Fans Want Some Things Kept Secret</a></p> <p>You need to buy these skills to progress in their respective trees, but they also should give you a good idea of the general direction each tree will take you. From there, I highly recommend observing what you think your weak points are while playing and what you’d like to improve.</p>

 <p><strong>But from the Mobility tree, everyone should at least snag “Marathon Runner” and “Youthful Lungs”</strong> so you can move and run farther and for longer.</p> <p><strong>From the Survival tree, I recommend everyone at least grab “Looter’s Instincts” and “Silent Scavenger.”</strong> These will help you loot faster and more quietly.</p>

 <p><strong>From the Conditioning tree, I recommend “Gentle Pressure” and “Proficient Pryer.”</strong> These two will combine to make your breaching faster and quieter.</p> <p>Lastly, <strong>everyone should aim to get “Security Breach”</strong> from Survival at some point, as it’s required for looting specific locations.</p> <p>These 10 skills will help you with some of the most consistent activities in <i>Arc Raiders</i>: traveling and looting.</p> <p>In my estimation, the usefulness of every other skill is highly dependent on your play style. For example, something like “Downed but Determined,” found in the Conditioning tree, will let you stay in a down-but-not-out state longer before you get fully knocked out. Personally, I’d rather focus on avoiding being downed and investing skill points into something like “Revitalizing Squat” in Survival, which boosts your stamina regeneration while crouched.</p>

 <p>Again, my playstyle, which is often solo, sees me routinely covering lots of distance, so taking a breather while crouched helps me stay moving–plus, if I’m hunkered down in cover and crouched, I’ll also regenerate stamina faster to get away from whatever bad situation ‘m in.</p> <p>That said, I can still offer some general guidelines for things to consider when selecting your skills based on whether you primarily play solo or in a group.</p> <h2><span id="15-of-the-best-skills-for-solo-players"></span>15 of the best skills for solo players<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641791"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641791">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>All of these skills should be considered in addition to the universal skills mentioned above. In my opinion, Mobility is perhaps the most important skill category for solo players who often need to get the hell out of a bad situation as fast as possible. <b>Consider investing in these Mobility skills if you’re running on your own</b>:</p>

 <ul> <li><b>Slip and Slide</b> (sliding is already pretty generous, so at least one point should work for a while)</li> <li><b>Sturdy Ankles</b></li> <li><b>Calming Stroll</b> (this ability lets you recover stamina while walking at the same rate as if you were still, making it a great way to recover stamina while still heading toward your destination)</li> <li><b>Effortless Roll</b></li> <li><b>Heroic Leap</b></li> </ul> <p>As you can probably guess, this is leaning toward a more parkour-based build, but I’ve found high Mobility is essential to staying alive when you don’t have backup regardless of how much you intend to move around like a typical <i>Assassin’s Creed </i>protagonist.</p> <p><b>From the Survival tree, I recommend the following skills for solo play:&nbsp;</b></p> <ul> <li><b>Revitalizing Squat</b> (lets you regenerate stamina more quickly while crouched, which can help you make your getaway if you’re hiding from an assailant)</li> <li><b>In-Round Crafting</b></li> <li><b>Good As New</b></li> <li><b>Stubborn Mule </b>(good only if you’re okay pushing your luck and exfiltrating with an encumbered status from carrying so much)</li> <li><b>Three Deep Breaths</b></li> <li><b>Traveling Tinkerer</b></li> </ul> <p>I haven’t unlocked some of these skills myself yet, but they’re likely to be the next ones I grab. Again, everything here maximizes stamina recovery and the ability to get what you need to do faster. And crafting in round is a great way to restock restorative items or make up for a poorly chosen loadout.</p> <p>Lastly, there’s Conditioning. As a CrossFit girl IRL, I’m all about conditioning, but I haven’t found it as useful in <i>Arc Raiders</i> for solo play. But your mileage may vary. <strong>I recommend investing in these Conditioning skills for solo runs:&nbsp;</strong></p>

 <ul> <li><b>Unburdened Roll</b> (if your shield pops, especially unexpectedly, this makes a reflexive roll less burdensome on your Stamina)</li> <li><b>A Little Extra</b></li> <li><b>Loaded Arms</b></li> <li><b>Fight or Flight </b>(you’ll need to grab Blast Born before you can buy this, which I don’t find as useful a skill, but them’s the rules of the tree)</li> </ul> <p>Depending on how you like to play the game, some of these skills might be more useful than others. And I’ve also left out some of the “end game” skills, as well as tips on which skills you should sink the most points into after the initial XP cost. The efficacy of any given skill is highly dependent on your own playstyle–and at that point, competency in this game means you should be making your own judgement calls for certain strategies you prefer. For example, I really like being able to breach something as fast as possible, so I’ve been investing more points into Proficient Pryer. But maybe that’s not as important to you, or, you have someone you play with who’s your group’s designated breacher, and so maybe it makes sense for another person to invest in these skills to round out your group’s abilities.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879">I Asked&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>Speaking of groups, let’s have a look at which skills are going to be the most beneficial for a crew.</p> <h2><span id="4-of-the-best-skills-for-groups"></span>4 of the best skills for groups<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Consider these group skills in addition to the universal skills I mentioned above, as well as some of the skills that are suitable for a solo player–being really fast and quiet makes you effective as a lone wolf, but it also makes you an asset on your team.</p>

 <p>When considering group play, we need to consider what actions are impossible when you’re on your own. Here’s one example: You can’t revive yourself in <i>Arc Raiders</i>! If you get downed near an extraction point, you can still potentially crawl your way to safety, but one of the first benefits of having comrades is that they can get you back on your feet. There are a few skills that help you with staying in the game while you’re in a downed-but-not-out state, so those are essential ones to snag. Let’s break it down for each of the trees.</p> <p><b>For Mobility, one skill makes the most sense for group play: Crawl Before You Walk.</b></p>

 <p>Everything else in this branch makes you faster and ups your stamina capabilities. So invest in those as you deem appropriate. If you think your character is too slow and quick to exhaust, then invest in the general skills I outlined, as well as the ones suitable for solo play. But also consider what role you’re going to play in your group. Maybe you’re the designated medic, carrying more restoratives than other people. If that’s the case, then you probably want to be speedy so you can get to a dying teammate as quickly as possible.</p> <p><b>From the Survival skill tree, grab Traveling Tinkerer if you’re typically in a group.</b> In addition to In-Round crafting, this will help you be the go-to person for crafting supplies Topside.</p>

 <p><b>For Conditioning, I recommend grabbing Downed But Determined and Turtle Crawl</b>. These will increase the amount of time you’re down-but-not-out, thus increasing your chances of getting revived by a teammate.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-in-my-skill-tree"></span>What’s in my skill tree?<span></span></h2> <p>I mostly play solo, and while I’ve purchased a few skills with a “see what happens” philosophy in mind, most of my choices were about making myself faster so that I can more quickly and efficiently get out of bad situations and cross great distances.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><em>Arc Raiders</em>: The Sickest, Silliest, And Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>At level 40, I’ve invested 25 points into Mobility, 9 points into Survival, and 7 into Conditioning. Here’s what my tree looks like:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641795" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641795"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641795">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For now, I’m quite happy with my build. In fact, if I froze my build options here, I wager I’d still have a perfectly fun time in the game; I’m fast and I’m hard to kill. (Someone tried again this morning. Didn’t work out for them.)</p> <p>I’d like to be able to craft more items during a game, so Traveling Tinkerer is on my list, as is A Little Extra, which will net me more resources while looting. I’m finding I’ve left behind my reliance on Free Loadouts and instead need to double down on crafting new gear and repairing what I have, so that seems to make the most sense.</p>
