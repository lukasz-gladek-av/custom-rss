With few games at release and no backwards compatibility, each new critically acclaimed gem that got ported felt like a special event. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">That’s not the case with Switch 2</a></span>. Instead, new owners have access to a wealth of back catalog riches from the jump, including years of the best indie games just waiting to become their next handheld obsession. Here are the ones I think everyone should have.</p><p>Odds are, if you’re a veteran Switch owner who recently upgraded to Switch 2, you already have a few of these in your library. If you’re a hardcore indie fan, you might even have all of them. This isn’t a list of the <em>best</em> games available for Nintendo’s platform, or the best<em> indie</em> games, or even a list of my personal favorites. Think of it more as an indie starter pack: a set of timeless stalwarts with immense replayability that remain perfect for diving into on any occasion.</p><p>While many of these games have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447/slides/30?_gl=1*12r7g6s*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5ODk1NjckbzY1JGcxJHQxNzUxOTk0NjAwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447/slides/30?_gl=1*12r7g6s*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5ODk1NjckbzY1JGcxJHQxNzUxOTk0NjAwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">filtered through <em>Kotaku</em>’s best Switch games list</a></span> over the years, it’s more of my own personal take on the canonical best all-around indie games to play either on the go, sitting by the pool, or late at night in bed. I hope it’s especially useful for anyone who has exhausted the Switch 2's initial launch lineup but wants a solid reason to keep playing their fancy new premium-feeling console. Wait until they’re on sale and you can also get almost all of them for the price of a single copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>The last 10 years have been great for mashups of old and new. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a></span> was one of the first to take the classic 2D exploration of a Metroidvania and infuse it with the punishing combat and memorable boss fights of a Soulslike.

In my opinion, it’s the “one of those” that best nails the balance of exploration, combat, and loot that makes the genre so compelling, and the art and animation are equally top-notch. It feels great, too, with the dodge and reload mechanics giving it a rewarding tactile quality you don’t always get in this type of arcade mashup. A handful of free updates only added to the depth. </p></div><div><p>No roguelike randomness or permadeath. No Metroidvania backtracking.

It came out over a decade ago and was ported to Switch in 2017. It’s incredible to think the studio behind it, Yacht Club Games, hasn’t released anything but expansions and spin-offs since.

Think of it as summer reading. It combines interesting storytelling that subverts genre expectations with an incredible soundtrack and novel turn-based combat mechanics. It’s like playing a version of the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> that breaks all of the rules and delivers on a deeper, more engaging experience in the process. The Switch port also added a new boss fight. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cuphead-the-kotaku-review-1818998781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cuphead-the-kotaku-review-1818998781"><em>Cuphead </em>combines</a></span> old-timey animation with run-and-gun gameplay into a game that’s beautiful to watch and challenging to beat. It began life as an Xbox exclusive, which is why it didn’t get to Switch until 2019 where it runs surprisingly well. There’s a “simple mode” for anyone who gets stuck, and co-op using single Joy-Con. The<em> Delicious Last Course</em> DLC in 2022 added a new mini-adventure, boss fights, and a third playable character. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span> is one of the more recent Switch indie hits, coming in the second half of the console’s life. It’s an isometric third-person action roguelike that couples snappy combat and a great mix of randomized upgrades and weapons with permanent unlocks, a cool story, and complex character relationships that unravel as you grind. The sequel is a timed console exclusive on Switch 1<em> </em>and 2 later this year. </p></div><div><p>Finally, a strategy game! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331?_gl=1*q11rpe*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5OTU2OTckbzI4JGcwJHQxNzUxOTk2NjE0JGo1NSRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331?_gl=1*q11rpe*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5OTU2OTckbzI4JGcwJHQxNzUxOTk2NjE0JGo1NSRsMCRoMA.."><em>Into the Breach</em></a></span> is a grid-based roguelike that’s as much a puzzle game as a stripped-down <em>XCOM</em>-like. The rub is that every time you lose you can keep your surviving mech pilot and send them back in time to start a new run. It’s like <em>Front Mission</em> meets <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, where using the geography to your advantage is as important as the skills and weapons you outfit your squad with. A free <em>Advanced Edition</em> update in 2022 added even more content. </p></div><div><p>I’ve been informed that we’re now calling <em>Vampire Survivors</em> a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3ltfy3kfmks2z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3ltfy3kfmks2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mowing game</a></span>,” which sounds a lot more fun and elegant than something like “bullet heaven auto battler.” Like lots of other games on this list, the 2022 hit keeps getting new DLC and free updates that expand the upgrade management formula with new characters, enemies, and maps. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-10-guide-tips-roguelite-steam-pc-1849723815&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-10-guide-tips-roguelite-steam-pc-1849723815">The beauty of <em>Vampire Survivors</em></a></span><em> </em>is that no matter how many times you start a new round, it effortlessly locks you in all over again.

However, unless you were too busy watching Nintendo Directs or haven’t looked at the in-game manual on the main menu, you’ve probably been sleeping on a really neat tool that <em>Mario Kart World </em>added to your driving repertoire. In light of this, let’s take a look at what the new Rewind command does, as well as how to use it to significantly improve the single player experience.</p><figure id="" data-id="eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-recommend-id="image://eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Mario Kart World.

Straightforward, right?</p><p>Well, there are a <em>few </em>nuances to how exactly Rewind works—The Dry Bones is in the details, as they say. For instance, <strong>Rewind doesn’t rewind the entire game when it’s used, just your driver’s position</strong>. So if you’re first in a race and you get hit by a red shell that knocks you into 24th place, you’ll still be in 24th even after using Rewind. In fact, you’ll be even <em>worse </em>off, as Rewind will just make your opponents’ leads even greater. </p><p>Rewind will also generally maintain your driver’s momentum from the moment you pressed Rewind, as opposed to resetting it to whatever state your driver was in at the point you Rewind to. To put that in simple terms, if you were going top speed and got hit with a red shell, you’ll still have to accelerate to reach top speed again even if you go back to the moment before you were hit with the shell. Conversely, if you <em>were </em>at your driver’s top speed at the time you press Rewind, you’ll be going just as fast as you were before hitting the Rewind button.</p><p><strong>Just keep in mind that Rewind is <em>completely incompatible </em>with Drifting.</strong> You can’t initiate a Rewind during a Drift, and you can’t rewind into a Drift either. If you’re in the middle of a race, make sure to think twice about using Rewind if you just finished turning a sharp corner.</p><h2 id="h58171"><a id=""></a>How to best use Rewind in<em> Mario Kart World</em></h2><p>This is starting to sound like a list of inconveniences. You might be wondering exactly <em>how </em>Rewind can realistically help you out in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. While this isn’t all-inclusive, there are two use cases where using Rewind can save you a lot of time and frustration.</p><p><strong>The first and most obvious use of Rewind is in Free Roam mode</strong>. There are several “?” Panels and Peach Medallions that require tricky jumps to reach, and setting those maneuvers up can take time. Normally, failing a huge leap means repeating all that driving around to return to your original vantage point. <strong>By using Rewind, you can easily undo your mistake and give it another shot in seconds.</strong> Rewind is equally helpful when you accidentally fall from a high place in a map that’d normally take a handful of minutes to return to!</p><figure id="" data-id="c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-recommend-id="image://c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif of Mario Kart World gameplay.

Waluigi is shown getting rewound to avoid the impact of a Blue Shell." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second reason you might want to Rewind is that <strong>it can make you impervious to Blue Shells</strong>. That’s right, as long as you’re in the middle of the Rewind animation, items and other racers can’t hurt you until it’s over. So when a Blue Shell is hanging over your head, a well-timed Rewind will completely circumvent the blast and preserve whatever item you were holding onto at the time.</p><p>You of course will still lose ground because of the way Rewind inherently works, and a Rewind <em>after </em>you get hit won’t do anything for you. Still, if you’ve hit your top speed and you’re on a straightaway, a quick Rewind won’t set you back as much as letting a shell smack you.</p><p>This isn’t all-inclusive of how Rewind can help, but once you realize these tricks exist, you’ll learn to really love this button.
