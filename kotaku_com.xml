              <p>Raise your hand if you’re one of those people with a too-large box or bin full of wall chargers of all shapes and sizes, 90 percent of which you haven’t used in years. It’s OK, that’s pretty much everybody these days, since any new smart device or laptop comes with one, so they accumulate. For the most part, they’re underpowered, undercompatible, and overall underperforming, which is why they live in that box, collecting dust.</p>
<p>One Anker Laptop Charger — a 140W monster with one USB-A and three USB-C ports and an LED screen that shows power output, port-specific details, and temperature data — should allow you to discard that box once and for all. And if you need two or more of them, now’s the time, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">a limited-time Amazon deal has it marked down by 35% to just $65.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four at a Time Charging</h2>
<p>Finding a charger that can fast-charge your laptop and three other devices at the same time — Apple, Android, Samsung, Google, you name it — conjures images of something large and unwieldy. The Anker Laptop Charger is smaller in size than the charging block that comes with MacBooks, and way more versatile. It’s 2.7 inches square with the charging prongs folded down into the body and just 1.42 inches thick, weighing just 9.7 ounces. It’s a tad big to be called pocket-sized, but if you put one in your carry-on or suitcase for a trip, you’ll never want to be without it again.</p>
<p>At that compact size, the Anker Laptop Charger can come with you all day long — start as a bedside plug so you know you’ll wake up with a fully charged smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and laptop. Pop the Anker into your backpack or briefcase as you tackle your day. If one of your devices is running low, just find an AC outlet and the fast, efficient charging will get you back into the green in no time. Bring it back home and it’s ready again for four-device fast charging that’s fast, safe, and universally compatible — that includes handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.</p>



<h2>Safe and Stable</h2>
<p>A huge pet peeve for anyone using a wall charging block is how easily they’re dislodged from the AC outlet. That’s especially true with multi-port models, because the ports are almost always positioned at the back of the block, away from the wall, where gravity handles the rest and slowly but surely starts to pull the prongs out of the outlet. The Anker’s ports are located at the bottom of the block, thwarting that downward pull, and the block can support up to 10.6 ounces while plugged in — greater than the 9.7 ounce weight of the block itself.</p>
<p>The Anker Laptop Charger is all about consolidating — all of those weaker one-port wall chargers can officially be walked to the curb now, and your travel or work bag won’t miss that enormous laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">While Amazon’s limited-time 35% off deal on the 4-port Anker Laptop Charger is in effect, it’s the $65 charging solution that goes anywhere, anytime.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-balance-patch-notes-dlc-sakurai-smash-bros-2000653001</link>
            <guid>1381693</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> just got its first big update and it could be one of the game’s last. Director Masahiro Sakurai previously promised the Switch 2 exclusive wouldn’t be a DLC-fest like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and it sounds like he’s sticking to that. While the new balance patch adjusts a bunch of vehicles and fixed plenty of bugs, the veteran developer said the goal is to not have to keep fiddling with it forever.</p> <p>“As discussed in Air Riders Direct 2, “Kirby’s Air Riders” does not have a production setup for DLC or anything like that,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1999297129186230755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1999297129186230755%7Ctwgr%5Ed405190b081ecd69a1546516d022529f124ffdfe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">wrote on X</a> on December 11, according to the site’s translation. “The team will be disbanding in the near future as well. Therefore, while we still have a short period of time to make adjustments, we’re aiming for a balance that can be enjoyed without issues even years from now. We might be able to tweak it one more time or so, but after that, please enjoy it as the completed balance!”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">エアライダーダイレクト2でお話した通り、『カービィのエアライダー』はDLCなどの制作体制を持ちません。<br>近いうち、チームも解散になります。</p> <p>よって、短い期間で手を打てるうちに､何年後でも問題なく遊べるバランスを目指しています。… <a href="https://t.co/L2JzJHzFb2">https://t.co/L2JzJHzFb2</a></p> <p>— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1999297129186230755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The response from players has mostly been relief. Players responded to the director by noting that they played the original GameCube entry “tirelessly” for years with no updates. “This is how it should be,” wrote another, arguing that its natural to play games for a while and then move one rather than expect them to constantly evolve to hold your attention.</p>

 <p>Rick was the only character that got directly tweaked <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">in the new update</a>. His Rip-Roaring Rick Special was nerfed in the City Trial and Air Ride modes, as was his HP and defense. The game’s various machines, on the other hand, got lots of tweaks. In addition to changes for quick spin to all vehicles, while Star-types were nerfed across the board and Tank-types were buffed.</p>

 <p>My favorite patch note by far, though, is one that shows just how weird game bugs can get. “An error will occur when opening the Gummies screen in the Collection menu when the number of Gummies is between 8,285 and 8,626,” it reads. “This does not occur if there are 8,284 or fewer Gummies or 8,627 or more Gummies.” That issue will be fixed in the next patch. Must be as complicated as it sounds!</p> <p>Sakurai saying the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> team is already getting ready to disband will of course fuel more rumors about his involvement in the next Smash Bros. for Switch 2. But it’s also in keeping with the commitment he outlined back before<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> launched. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” he said back during <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-gunning-for-the-best-racer-of-2025-ive-thrown-everything-i-have-into-this-game-2000638593">one of the Air Rider Directs</a>. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, on the other hand, could really use <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066">a fresh infusion</a> of new content.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-this-15-6-portable-monitor-at-its-lowest-price-since-launch-for-a-year-end-sale-already-selling-out-fast-2000652662</link>
            <guid>1381666</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re a multitasker looking to expand your viewing area for better productivity, adding a portable monitor to your setup can be a smart move. These are easy to carry with you on the go and convenient to set up literally anywhere you want, plus most options fall into a fairly affordable range. Thankfully, there’s a way to bring one home for even less today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/">Right now, you can grab the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after Amazon generously dropped it by 44%</a>. The discount lets you save a whopping $45 on your purchase, and there is no shipping fee to worry about, either. However, while the retailer hasn’t specified an expiry date for the offer, we’re not expecting it to be around for long. It’s best to get yours in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Visuals on a Bright Screen</h2>
<p>For under $60, you’re getting a 15.6-inch display. The size matches most standard laptops, so it’ll instantly feel quite familiar. It pushes a resolution of 1920x1080P, which is paired with HDR technology to expand the overall brightness and color range in content. You’ll enjoy better color accuracy, with brighter whites and deeper blacks for a more lifelike visual experience, regardless of what you’re using the monitor for.</p>
<p>The screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle that delivers consistent visuals from every side, so you don’t exactly need to sit directly in the front to see what’s happening. It’s especially handy when you’re sharing the monitor with a bunch of people, as everyone will be able to see it clearly without awkwardly shifting around. The built-in speaker takes care of the sound, while the low blue light support lets you use the screen for an extended period without compromising your eye health. The latter is something those who often pull all-nighters will appreciate.</p>



<p>InnoView monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective cover made of durable PU leather, which not only keeps it safe from daily wear and tear but also doubles as a stand to prop the thing up. It features two grooves that are used to adjust the angle of the screen based on what you require. Maybe keep it upright when you’re using it at your desk, or tilt it back for a more relaxed angle while streaming your favorite show or catching up with friends on a video call!</p>
<p>As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices (HP laptop, Lenovo laptop, Dell laptop, Asus laptop, Macbook, iPhone, game console, tablet, PS, Xbox, etc), as long as they support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-MODE. The two fully-functional Type-C ports and one HDMI port offer a straightforward plug-and-play functionality, which makes it easy to get started with using the monitor right away.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to reduce frequent window/tab hopping and enjoy more screen space, we highly recommend adding a portable monitor to your setup. With this one, you can work with multiple programs at the same time, instead of juggling everything on your main display. You can also extend your phone’s visuals when taking a video call, plus play your favorite games remotely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6365/">This deal brings its price down to $57, but it’s likely going to expire soon. It’s best to snap yours before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</a> That said, now is also a good time to stock up on other tech essentials like earbuds and tablets, since there’s plenty going at a discount. We’ve been covering the best deals that are actually worth your money, so be sure to check back for the latest drops.</p>

              <p>The homestretch of the 2025 holiday shopping season is going to be full of surprises, flash deals, and more as manufacturers pull out all the stops to hit their year-end numbers. That’s good news for shoppers, as anyone on the hunt for a great new smartwatch will see when they notice this Amazon deal on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">One of the best new wearables of 2025, the big 46mm model of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is at its all-time low price right now, just $400.</a></p>
<p>Amazon’s red-flagged this 20%-off deal with a big “selling fast” sign, which could very well mean a rapidly shrinking inventory that could cause the deal to vanish as suddenly as it appeared. Not surprising, considering how the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is one of the best Android smartwatches at its original $500 price point, and now it’s $100 under that number.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Shape Shifter</h2>
<p>One of the cool features of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is that it’s designed to take on an elegant, traditional look, complete with a detailed rotating bezel that directs you to your apps, and a face that looks like a luxury chronograph even when you get up close to it. With that face, the beautiful stainless steel bezel and crown, and a black eco leather and band, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is perfectly at home on a date or at a formal occasion.</p>
<p>Its best work, of course, happens when you’re active, and in need of a reliable health and workout tracker with a robust suite of apps and features. It has a built-in Running Coach feature that takes into account your age, weight, heart rate, and even your oxygen level as you run, keeping you at a pace that works for both your fitness and training goals and your overall health. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic also has one of the better Sleep Coaching features of any midrange smartwatch, along with helpful metrics that aren’t commonly found in smartwatches like Vascular Load readings to track the amount of stress on your heart, and an Antioxidant Index that tracks the level of antioxidants in your body to help inform your food and lifestyle choices.</p>



<h2>Smart, Watch</h2>
<p>Any Samsung Galaxy smartwatch is going to come loaded with the best smart tech and interactivity with the rest of the Samsung universe. That means Galaxy AI and Google Gemini to serve as your hands-free assistants on the go whenever you need something, instant updates from your calendar and any other app you want to keep abreast of, and of course seamless connections to the Samsung family of smartphones, wireless earbuds, tablets, and laptops.</p>
<p>Call this Amazon deal one of the better somewhat-last-minute finds of the holiday shopping season. But whatever you call it, do it soon, because t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6362/">he 46mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is flying out of inventory faster than anticipated at its all-time low price of $400.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro 3 Drops Below Its Black Friday Price, Now as Cheap as the Pro 2 on Sale]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-airpods-pro-3-is-now-as-cheap-as-the-pro-2-sale-price-and-even-lower-than-its-black-friday-deal-2000652626</link>
            <guid>1381627</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple unveiled its latest pair of earbuds – the Apple AirPods Pro 3 – in September this year, and our audio experts loved the upgrades these brought. They launched at the standard $249 price, but we just spotted a deal that lets you pick them up for less today.</p>
<p>Amazon has now dropped the AirPods Pro 3 to $199, after taking 20% off, bringing the pair back to its lowest price ever. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, and placing your orders today can help you get them just in time for Christmas. If you’ve been meaning to upgrade your audio gear, or surprise a music lover in your life this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Sound, Better ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>These look quite similar to AirPods Pro 2, but feature a slightly redesigned shape with new foam-infused silicone ear tips for a better fit. The new acoustic architecture gives sound quality a boost, delivering rich, deep audio that lets you enjoy your favorite tracks and podcasts with detailed clarity. It lets you feel every instrument, with vivid vocals like never before.</p>
<p>Active noise cancellation capabilities have improved, too, as this pair is capable of removing up to 2x more unwanted noise than AirPods Pro 2; great for when you want to stay fully immersed in the moment with your favorite track playing. The ANC mode works well when you don’t want background sounds to distract you. You can enable it when you’re working in a busy cafe or trying to focus on an important task in the office. Of course, this level of noise blocking doesn’t work for every situation – sometimes it’s better to stay present and aware of what’s happening around. For that, there’s the transparency mode, which lets some ambient sound in.</p>



<p>Regardless of the mode, AirPods Pro 3 customize the sound signature for your unique ear geometry and fit with its next-generation Adaptive EQ. What’s more, these protect your hearing health, too. You can take an at-home hearing test that checks your hearing in a broader range of everyday conditions, or use the pair as a hearing aid when you need the voices around you amplified. Those often exposed to loud environmental noise can put them on to prevent hearing loss as well. Other health features include heart rate sensing, which monitors your heart rate, plus calories burned for up to 50 different workout types.</p>
<p>Another solid selling point is the Live Translation feature, which uses Apple Intelligence to offer real-time translation for face-to-face conversations around the world. Basically, the earbuds pick up on what someone is saying and translate it instantly, letting you reply in your preferred language using your iPhone or their AirPods. As for the battery life, you’ll enjoy up to 8 hours of listening on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation on, and up to 10 hours in Transparency using the Hearing Aid feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">This deal brings the price of this feature-packed pair to $199, from $249</a>. It’s a big discount, sure, considering how these just launched, it’s still a welcome drop. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly before it wraps up. Ordering now will also help you enjoy free shipping with your purchase!</p>
