But a new look at an improved gameplay feature in the upcoming remake, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, might just be enough to convert this jaded fan who’s convinced the series peaked at <em>Sons of Liberty</em>. In a 12-second clip, Naked Snake can be seen swapping his camo from a foresty look to something more suitable for an urban environment in record time. It’s way faster and less cumbersome-looking than the camo-swapping of the original. Check it out:</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196805,196055" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Hell yeah, that’s a whole three seconds to swap camo with an in-game menu that looks pretty snappy. The original required you to pause the game, then select “camouflage” from a menu, then select “face” or “uniform” before choosing your desired pattern.</p><p>As I said earlier, at best I feel sorta “meh” about <em>MGS3</em>; the menu-diving the original demands of you to swap camo, eat anything, and treat your wounds is one of its biggest offenders in my opinion (alongside the boring, self-indulgent story and that god awful song). I found it very hard to stay engaged in the action when the game made me sort through menu screens so often, despite the camo being a genuinely neat idea. </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em> notably eschewed the whole eating and wound-healing stuff (for the better). It would keep the camo, though. And since it took place many decades after <em>MGS3</em>, there was a sci-fi twist on it that made things much smoother. In <em>MGS4</em>, Old Snake could just lean against almost any wall and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/giKSkJtuaB0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/giKSkJtuaB0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">absorb the texture via his nifty OctoCamo</a></span> which, it turns out, was inspired by the natural camouflage abilities of real-life octopi. </p><p>The natural ability of octopi was also referenced in <em>MGS4</em> via the game’s opening faux TV ads.</p><p>While some of us might be a little skeptical of this post-Kojima <em>MGS</em> future we’re entering with <em>Delta</em>, it’s nice to see Konami looking for opportunities to improve existing aspects of the game. Here’s hoping eating and wound-healing will be just as speedy in the remake, which arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 28, 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The massive deal allows the founding Guillemot family to remain in control of the publisher despite its recent struggles and cratering share price. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196566" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The details of the agreement are complex and it’s not immediately clear how it will all hash out in practice. The new entity doesn’t have a name yet but will have its own board of supervisors and include Ubisoft studios Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Those teams will be in charge of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> franchises moving forward, as well as their back catalogs. But all of it will still report up to Ubisoft proper and its current CEO, Yves Guillemot.<br></p><p> “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success,” Guillemot said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> on Thursday. “With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.” </p><p>On a call with investors following the announcement, however, the company’s leadership clarified that Ubisoft 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will still report up to Guillemot. “There will be a dedicated management under the supervision of a board that will be controlled by Ubisoft,” CFO Frederick Duguet told investors. “So Ubisoft will continue controlling and consolidating this entity.”</p><p>The major deal comes after months of speculation about a possible sale of the French publisher following a year of poor sales for some of its biggest recent blockbusters, including <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as delays and cancellations of other big releases, including free-to-play shooter&nbsp;<em>The Division Heartland</em>. Those rumors included a shareholder report that Ubisoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was even exploring a sale</a></span> of some of its franchises to Microsoft and others. Under the new structure, series like <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Rayman</em> will remain under the broader Ubisoft umbrella. <br></p><p>Ubisoft is a sprawling organization with studios and employees spread out all over the world. The complex web facilitates a co-development process that the company uses to ship massive games in shorter time periods. But that also means that there’s no clean delineation between who works on what. While The Montreal and Quebec studios lead development on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, many employees within those offices still work on other franchises as needed. </p><p>Asked by investors how many of Ubisoft’s over 17,000 employees would be moving to the new group, the company said it was still too early to tell. That sentiment was echoed in an email sent to staff today from Ubisoft head of studios Marie-Sophie de Waubert. This brings some uncertainty and questions,” she wrote in an email obtained by<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>. “Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly.”</p><p>Two key provisions of the new agreement are that Tencent cannot sell its 25 percent equity stake for at least five years and Ubisoft “may not cease to hold a majority of New subsidiary voting rights and share capital for a 2-year period.” In the near term at least, the $1.25 billion deal sounds more like a financial instrument than anything else, and one that provides Ubisoft’s current ownership with more time to try to improve the company’s financial outlook. Prior to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadow</em>’s launch, many asked if it would be enough to save the company from being broken up and sold for parts. For now at least, it seems like it won’t need to. </p><p><em>Update 3/27/2025 2:35 p.m. ET: Added more context from the investor call and internal emails. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
