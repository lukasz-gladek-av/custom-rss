These phantoms last around one minute and there can be multiple phantoms on the field at once.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-revenant-fight-summon-1851782968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-unlock-revenant-fight-summon-1851782968">How To Unlock Revenant, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s Hidden Necromancer Class</em></a></span></p><p>This ability works on pretty much all of the smaller enemies and even some of the minor bosses. If you can raise multiple phantoms simultaneously, they can easily overwhelm enemies. The phantoms also serve as distractions for you and your teammates. Unfortunately, phantoms can’t follow you to other areas, so you’ll have to reanimate some new ones as you continue to defeat enemies in new areas.</p><h2 id="h773922"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Summon Spirit</h2><p>Summon Spirit is Revenant’s Character Skill, which lets her call forth one of three family ghosts to fight alongside her. Helen the Page is a small but nimble sword fighter, Frederick the Pumpkin Head is a large and slow, yet more powerful beast, and Sebastian the Giant Skeleton is a humongous stationary monster.</p><figure id="" data-id="08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-recommend-id="image://08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large spirit stands next to Revenant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large spirit stands next to Revenant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-recommend-id="image://08666234e00a0af652da4a2d51a2ef3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large spirit stands next to Revenant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Revenant can summon only one of these ghosts at a time </strong>(regardless of how many phantoms were reanimated through Necromancy) and they each have a separate HP bar. When called back, they gradually recover HP. Your ghostly buddies will work well against regular smaller encounters, but they struggle during boss fights with their limited damage output and relatively low health. At least they’re good as distractions.</p><h2 id="h773923"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Immortal March</h2><p>Revenant’s Ultimate Art is called Immortal March, and it makes herself, her ghosts, and allies immortal for about 15 seconds within her range. To clarify, <strong>being “immortal” doesn’t mean that incoming damage will be negated. It just means that they will still retain 1 HP while under the effects of Immortal March even if they get hit with a deathblow that would have otherwise downed them.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-recommend-id="image://165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Revenant uses her ultimate attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Revenant uses her ultimate attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-recommend-id="image://165ecd94943064e454bde3e8972d33eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Revenant uses her ultimate attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Immortal March also activates her ghost family’s ultimate attacks. Helen will attack with a sword combo, Frederick will spin around its hammer and hit enemies multiple times, and Sebastian will fire a giant beam at enemies.</p><p>Immortal March, however, is best used as a defensive maneuver. It will automatically revive any downed teammates nearby.</p><h2 id="h773924"><a id="4"></a>A look at the Revenant attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: D</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: B</li></ul><p>Revenant is unique in that she doesn’t have any preferred weapons or equipment, but there are a few to look out for that could help. Greatshields can be helpful to block incoming enemy attacks and buy time for her phantoms and ghost friends to take care of them for her. You might also want to give her a crossbow so she at least has a weapon to fight back with.</p><p>You’ll most likely want to gather as many incantations as possible to cast spells. If you happen to come across any rare weapons like Sword of Night and Flame and the Dark Moon Greatsword, be sure to pick those up as her S rank in Faith scales well with them.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>: A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Recluse</a></span></p><p>Unlike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-magic-fp-residue-cocktail-1851783591">Recluse</a></span>, Revenant doesn’t have a way to recover FP on her own, so she relies heavily on consumables like Starlight Shards. Players should also prioritize equipping relics and choosing passive drops that will either boost the amount of runes dropped by enemies or decrease shop prices. That way, she can purchase as many Starlight Shards as possible.</p><hr><p><br><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company has recently announced, ahead of the start of the third season of the best of all those shows, <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, that it’s to get a fourth <em>and</em> a fifth season too! Woo! Although that fifth run will be truncated, and be its last. Boo!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197585" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="120" data-playlist="197585,197583,197582" data-current="197585"><div><p>A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23106.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The experiments in the final frontier have had mixed results over the last decade. Beginning with the very promising <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> in 2017, the long-abandoned television franchise returned from a 12-year hiatus since the (merciful) demise of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise </em>in 2005—a period that had otherwise only been populated by J. J. Abrams aimless and soon-abandoned reboot movies. This was then followed in 2020 by <em>Picard</em>, quickly accompanied by animated comedy <em>Lower Decks</em>, kids animation <em>Prodigy</em> in 2021, and then in 2022 the beginning of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>.</p><p>Now, clearly making judgement on anything <em>Star Trek</em> is a surefire way to get a person in all manner of trouble, but who cares: <em>Discovery</em>’s five seasons offered diminishing returns, its fourth series reaching a nadir of utter dreadfulness that was only mildly improved upon in its fifth meandering final run. <em>Picard</em> was so excruciatingly bad as to have been ruled illegal under the Geneva Convention, although its third and final season—while still rubbish—delivered joyfully silly fan-service as it reunited as much of the <em>The Next Generation</em> crew as would agree to stagger onto set. <em>Lower Decks</em> was utterly brilliant for five glorious years and you should watch it immediately. No one, not even the people who wrote and drew it, watched <em>Prodigy</em>. And <em>Strange New Worlds</em> has made the entire roller coaster worthwhile.</p><p>The mistake both <em>Discovery</em> and <em>Picard</em> made was to believe <em>Star Trek</em> was ever supposed to be more than people in pastel colors exchanging sci-fi gobbledegook, blowing up a spaceship, and then learning a jolly nice lesson in time for the credits. Presumably attempts to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle moments from the earlier series, like “The Best of Both Worlds” or “In The Pale Moonlight,” they failed to understand these only worked <em>because</em> they stood out from the usual amiable chatter. Both series just felt morose, hopeless, and as such, distinctly un-Trek.</p><p><em>Strange New Worlds</em> (and <em>Lower Decks</em> for that matter) understands the brief. Set before the events of the original 1960s <em>Star Trek</em> TV show (well, in between the events of the pilot and the rest of the series, nerds), it span off from one of <em>Discovery</em>’s finer moments, as we see Captain Pike faced with a vision of a gruesome accident that would ruin his life. But, put that aside, because now we’re off to enjoy the voyages of the Starship Enterprise before Kirk gets into the captain’s chair, and it’s going to be so much fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-recommend-id="image://409ac2511202a404526b31fea67d2185" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr and Mrs Pike stare into a bright light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The previous two seasons of <em>Strange New Worlds </em>have brought us some of the best <em>Star Trek </em>ever. It’s bright, and positive, and features an incredibly capable crew driven to be a force of good in the galaxy. They are very much on a five-year mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no humans have gone before. And if that means getting trapped in a fairy tale, or a space creature causing the entire crew to communicate in musical numbers, then dammit they’ll do that so flipping well. And they’ll do it with impeccable haircuts.</p><p>As such, when things do get more serious, they’re mostly earned, and you know aren’t going to end in inescapable doom. (Although, let’s be fair, S02E10's “Hegemony” was an embarrassing miss in its attempt to suddenly turn into <em>Alien</em>.) So, it is with absolute delight that I greet the news that Paramount is letting it serve its full five-year mission.</p><p>It’s vanishingly rare for any TV series, let alone streaming ones, to get guaranteed episodes for a further two seasons in advance. It means that on top of season three’s 10 episodes, we’re promised another 10 for season four, followed by an abbreviated six-episode run for season five. And yes, admittedly, the 26 episodes this assures us of is the same number as a single-season order for <em>Trek</em> in the 90s, but times have changed, and honestly, I’m grateful we get <em>any</em>.</p><p>Also, while I’d love the idea of the show running for as long as the cast and writers are willing, it does make a lot of sense to give <em>SNW</em> a termination date. As much as the joy of things as daft as seeing cartoon characters from <em>Lower Decks</em> appear in this live-action show distracts us, the reality is we <em>are</em> heading toward Pike’s accident, determined not only by his earlier vision, but also by August 23, 1969's episode of <em>Star Trek</em>, when the disfigured post-accident Pike appeared, sealing his fate some 56 years ago. They can’t keep putting it off forever.</p><p>But, we’ve got a solid 20 episodes before we need to worry about any of that! And the trailer for the new season, which starts July 17, suggests it’s going to be fun times. Including Patton Oswalt as a Vulcan! And, thank goodness, it doesn’t look like Nurse Chapel is going anywhere.</p><p>It’s all on Paramount Plus, which can more conveniently be accessed through Amazon Prime, along with all the episodes of the other mentioned shows. But honestly, just watch this and <em>Lower Decks</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
