              <p>I’ve never played an isometric RPG that didn’t feel better with turn-based combat, so it’s really neat to hear <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-exploit-update-obsidian-pillars-eternity-2-removed-steam-2000631633">that <em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> will be testing the more tactical option in the weeks ahead. It’ll hopefully be more intuitive for some players than the game’s existing “real-time with pause” combat, and get more people to check out where Obsidian Entertainment’s big fantasy series got its start.</p> <p>Testing on the new mode will begin November 5 for the PC version of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with plans to add it in a future patch. Game director Josh Sawyer called it a big undertaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8">in a video blog</a> announcing the update, and said it was inspired by the positive reception to the addition of turn-based combat in <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-is-getting-a-turn-based-mode-1831961398">back in 2019</a>. That said, fans had criticism of the system which Sawyer said will be addressed for the version coming to the original <em>Pillars</em>.</p> <p>“One of the major changes is that action economy is a lot more accurate to the real-time with pause game,” he said. “It’s not a one-to-one translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real-time with pause mode.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action">To keep combat from feeling slow, lethality has been buffed so that fights aren’t super drawn out. Obsidian is also looking at a HUD toggle to let players swap combat modes on the fly, but there will be an option in the game settings menu that players can change at will either way. Fans are taking the news well and already demanding a sequel. “Please give this man the budget of <em>BG3</em> to make the next <em>Pillars</em>,” one wrote on YouTube.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> might be an older game at this point but its universe is one that keeps getting carried forward, most recently with 2025’s great <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a>. The turn-based mode will make it easier for players to revisit where the fantasy world of Eora got its start. It would be nice if it eventually comes to the console version of the game as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Following some disruptive server issues after <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend was slammed with an influx of players, Embark Studios is giving out 500 Raider Tokens to those who played on Sunday, which translates to about five bucks in real, U.S. dollars. It’s a nice gesture, but as many in the growing <i>Arc Raiders</i> community have pointed out, five bucks ain’t gonna get you a whole lot in the in-game shop.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday, Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step 🐓<br>As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday.</p> <p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381493829443634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers were <i>packed</i> this weekend. Hitting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone has helped land the extraction shooter in the top five most-played games on Valve’s storefront, putting it just under <i>Battlefield 6</i>. The game is winning over an eager fanbase with its engaging progression systems and hardcore gameplay loop. But <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ in-game cosmetic shop is a sore spot for many, especially given that the game requires a $40 purchase to play.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">How The Hell Did We Let $20 Skins Become A Thing?</a></p> <p>“I thought $10 worth of coins would be enough to buy [a particular] skin, not the bundle, just the skin,” a Redditor writes in a post titled “The prices are…a little spicy, right?” Whether you’re playing <i>Fortnite </i>or <i>Diablo IV </i>or any number of other games, it’s become all too common to see high price tags affixed to the privilege of sporting a new digital look.</p>

   <p>But to many <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ fans, it’s not just the price, but the lack of customization options with the pricey cosmetics that’s getting under their skin. For now, while you can mix up different backpacks with different outfits, items like goggles, helmets, and boots are all tied to the skin they come with. So no astronaut suit with a cowboy hat for you.</p>

 <p>“The fact that [the] entire costume comes in one piece with some minimal customization,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm95vw5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment reads</a>, “rather than pieces you can slap on later and recombine with other stuff kinda drags value down for me.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm8blmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">highly upvoted comment reads</a>, “Step 1: Don’t buy it. Step 2: Watch as prices become reasonable.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1om2l23/we_need_to_be_able_to_mix_match_helmets_round_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post with nearly 1,000 upvotes</a> encourages players to use Embark Studios’ support site to request the ability to swap helmets across different outfits.</p>

   <p>Other folks haven’t been as kind, with one popular post on Reddit describing a particular facial cosmetic as paying four bucks to “have poop smeared on your face,” while countless other players are upset over a lack of customization options for things such as beards.</p>   <p>Perhaps these pricing concerns wouldn’t be as salient if the game were free-to-play, like Embark’s other game <i>The Finals</i>. But given the $40 asking price, which feels plenty fair for a game of this scale, demanding half the cost of the game just to dress up a certain way feels odd to say the least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663#:~:text=The%20Simpsons%20are%20seemingly%20on%20their%20way%20to%20Fornite%C2%A0">After rumors and leaks</a>, <em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season went live over the weekend, and I had a giant smile on my face as I ran around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296">new Springfield map</a>, no matter how many times I got sniped by random Gokus and Peelys.</p> <p>Over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">I’ve made it very clear that I’m not a fan of the growing trend of crossovers in video games</a>. Sticking Master Chief in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> or jamming Godzilla into <em>Call of Duty</em> has always been weird and nasty to me. It feels like all of pop culture is merging into a giant grey blob. It makes me sad. Yet, I always give <em>Fortnite</em> a pass because, for many years now, it has been an IP playground. <em>Fortnite</em> is just a giant mess of stuff, a new internet for the next generation. So what if they add Luke Skywalker or Ariana Grande to it? But even if I wasn’t willing to give <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a> a pass, I’d still be playing this new <em>Simpsons</em> season because it’s so dang good.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-simpsons-drop-into-springfield-in-br-and-delulu?lang=en-US">Launched on November 1</a>, the<em> Fortnite x Simpsons</em> mini-season turns the entire battle royale into a <em>Simpsons</em> video game, something we haven’t gotten in over a decade. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796">it’s been nearly 20 years since the last console-based <em>Simpsons</em> game</a> and over two decades since 2005’s beloved <em>Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. That alone makes this new <em>Fortnite</em> season super special. The first time I landed at Evergreen Terrace in <em>Fortnite</em> and explored the Simpsons’ house, I had the biggest grin on my face and was excited to just poke at each room and detail. I was quickly killed by someone actually playing the game, but I didn’t care. I was finally playing a new, modern 3D <em>Simpsons</em> game in 2025, even if it was just a <em>Fortnite</em> event.</p>

  <p>Exploring beyond the Simpsons’ home, I found so many locations and details from the show. Want to visit Moe’s Bar? It’s here, and you can even hear a prank call from Bart. The first time I visited the Nuclear Power Plant, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Trivia">I heard a crow squawk, a detail that is always included when the location appears in an episode</a>. The Aztec Theatre is here. Mr. Burns’ massive mansion is fully explorable. Kamp Krusty is falling apart, but still explorable and properly dilapidated. Even the tire fire and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Tomacco">tomacco farm</a> can be found in <em>Fortnite’s</em> new Springfield map. I even found a store selling Poochie merch. If you’re a big fan of the show like me, you’ll likely die a lot this season because you’ll be too distracted by Easter eggs, references, and details to notice the enemy players hunting you down.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640879">©Epic / Disney</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, beyond the map are skins based on characters from the show. At the moment, the battle pass has added Marge and Homer, and Bart is for sale in the store. Bart is wearing a strange mech exo-suit thing, which I get is the only way to make that character work within <em>Fortnite’s</em> proportions, but it does look odd. Based on leaks and trailers, we know that Krusty, Moe, Ned, Scratchy, and a <em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;spin on Peely are coming, too. Personally, I hope a few more characters are coming as well, but my wallet is begging for the opposite.</p>

 <p>We are even getting a series of animated <em>Simpsons</em> shorts that connect to this new <em>Fortnite</em> season, with many of the original voice actors involved. And the main series on Fox included a grisly bit involving Peely in the show’s latest episode. It’s full-on media synergy, baby!</p>

  <p>But yeah, a few days into this new <em>Fortnite</em> x <em>Simpsons</em> season, I’m hugely impressed with what Epic has pulled off. The new island is not only fun to play on and filled with tons of details, but it also looks gorgeous. Everything has this show-accurate cel-shaded look, from random pieces of flooring to iconic buildings and more. I really hope Epic lets people tinker with this map within <em>Fortnite’s</em> content creation tools in the future because it feels like a waste to throw it all away at the end of this month when the mini-season wraps up.</p> <p>Until then, I’ll be dropping in on Springfield, saying thanks to Otto (the season’s bus driver) and finding more Easter eggs and silly details from my favorite comedy series of all time. And hey, maybe this season’s popularity will remind Disney that people want <em>Simpsons</em>-themed video games? One can hope.</p>
