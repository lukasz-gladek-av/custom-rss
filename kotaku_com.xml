It’s refreshing after seeing <em>Overwatch 2</em> sand off all its edges in pursuit of being the main esports hero shooter on the market. However, the hope that the wonkiness would last felt like a pipe dream for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, as NetEase was eventually going to have to put out some balance changes that would tone down some of the shenanigans. However, now we have the details on the first balance patch launching alongside the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-fantastic-four-patch-notes-map-1851733602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-fantastic-four-patch-notes-map-1851733602"><em>Fantastic Four</em>-focused season</a></span> and it contains just the right amount of tweaks, offering some encouragement for the game’s future.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>NetEase released the full patch notes after teasing them earlier this week as it rolled out information about Season 1. Some of the previously announced hero changes are here, such as the nerfs for Hela and Hawkeye and the buffs for Venom and Captain America, but there’s also a handful of smaller tweaks to a large swath of the roster. I’d still argue Cap needs a bit more damage to his kit if he’s going to be a brawler and that Hela’s minimal health reduction is not enough, but it’s probably the right approach to make some light changes here and there instead of turning the dial too far in either direction.</p><p>Individual heroes got rebalanced, but several Team-Up abilities also got some buffs. Almost all of the ones affected received perks of some kind, whether that be in shorter cooldowns or increased damage output. The full notes patch read as follows:</p><h2 id="h425394"><a id=""></a><strong>VANGUARD</strong></h2><p><strong>Captain America</strong><br><em>Steve will receive some enhanced survivability, allowing more frequent entering and exiting of the combat.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Reduce the delay time for shield restoration after releasing Living Legend from 3s to 2s.</em></li><li><em>Reduce Liberty Rush cooldown from 12s to 10s.</em></li><li><em>Increase base health from 650 to 675.</em></li><li><em> Reduce the energy cost for releasing Freedom Charge (ultimate ability) from 3400 to 3100; Reduce the additional health provided per second to self after releasing it from 110 to 100.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Doctor Strange</strong><br><em>We’ll be reducing the threat range and increasing the defense window of the Sorcerer Supreme.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Add damage falloff to Maelstrom of Madness and Gamma Maelstrom.

But the Steam Deck wasn’t powered by Windows as most gaming PCs are these days. Instead, it was powered by SteamOS, a Linux-based, gaming-focused operating system that made it easier than ever to buy, install, and play almost any PC game on the portable device. And it’s SteamOS—and Valve’s dedication to making a gaming-focused OS—that made the Steam Deck a big hit. </p><h2 id="h73341"><a id=""></a>SteamOS is the reason the Steam Deck is popular</h2><p>Companies had tried to do handheld gaming PCs (not laptops) before Valve. One example would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPD Win</a></span>, which featured a full keyboard and built-in Xbox controls. It could play games, but it ran on Windows, and felt clunky and slow. Other Windows- or Linux-based handheld PC were similarly clunky, hard to use, and often expensive. </p><p>The Steam Deck succeeded because it’s dead simple and easy to use, thanks to SteamOS and its compatibility features. Nearly any Steam game you already own, besides VR stuff, can work on the Steam Deck. And, in most cases, you won’t have to do much of anything to get it running. You use the easy-to-navigate menus of SteamOS to select a game, install it, and hit play. That’s it. </p><p>In the years since Valve released the Steam Deck and its slick operating system, other companies like Lenovo and ROG have released Steam-Deck-like competitors. And while many of these devices are more powerful than the Steam Deck, none of them include SteamOS, instead running on Windows 11. As a result, these devices are harder to use and clunkier. And sure, the companies behind them have tried to add their own software to make things easier, but it’s never quite as simple as the Steam Deck It’s that simplicity that allowed a lot of people who didn’t consider themselves PC gamers to buy a Steam Deck and enjoy it anyway as a straightforward, console-like experience.</p><h2 id="h73342"><a id=""></a>Microsoft let Valve create and then dominate the market</h2><p>During all of this, Microsoft had a chance to potentially step in and offer a lightweight, easy-to-use version of Windows 11 that portable PC makers could slap onto their devices. But the parent company of Xbox never did. </p><p>Now, in 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve is ready to make it easier</a></span> than ever to install SteamOS on more devices. Not only that, but now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo has announced the first third-party device</a></span> that will ship with SteamOS.  I expect by 2026 all handheld makers will offer SteamOS versions of their existing devices; likely at a cheaper price, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989">Sure, <em>now </em>Microsoft is talking more openly about a portable</a></span>, Xbox-like device and changes to Windows 11 that will make it a more handheld-friendly experience. But it really feels like Microsoft dragged its feet for too long and is now trying to play catch up. And I just don’t think it will be able to offer a version of Windows 11 that will be better than SteamOS anytime soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Valve is soon going to let any company use its gaming OS as the backbone of future devices, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let users install SteamOS</a></span> on any portable PC they own.</p><p>This is likely to lead to a situation in which SteamOS is just considered the default way to play games on a portable PC, similar to how Steam is vastly more popular than Microsoft’s built-in Microsoft/Xbox/whatever app store that comes pre-installed on all Windows devices. And if SteamOS makes its way onto TV-based console-like devices or desktops, I think it will find a lot of success there too. A lot of people want to just play games, surf the web, and maybe listen to some music on their PC, and SteamOS can accommodate all of that easily. </p><p>Microsoft had a chance to compete with Valve in the handheld gaming space. Instead, it just...didn’t. Microsoft will likely never be able to dethrone SteamOS as the most popular way to play PC games on the go, especially if Valve keeps updating it to be better, faster, and easier to use. </p><p>Sure, Microsoft won’t go bankrupt anytime soon, but Xbox had a chance to dominate a corner of the gaming market and possibly expand its reach on desktop PCs, too. But time has seemingly run out for that to happen, and Valve has won again.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
