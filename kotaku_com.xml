Many of the most popular school shooting simulators are created by a group known as Active Shooter Studios or A.S.S. </p><p>A.S.S has reportedly created <em>Roblox </em>maps and online games based on mass shootings like those that have happened at Uvalde, Parkland, and Columbine. One of the studio’s most popular maps is “Carbine,” a <em>Roblox </em>recreation of the 1999 Columbine high school massacre which took the lives of a dozen students and one teacher while injuring many more. In “Carbine” players can take on the role of the shooters themselves and recreate the deadly shooting. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by the ADL</a></span>, these maps aren’t just simple pieces of geometry that mimic a real world location. Instead they are highly detailed and contain disturbing features. The report says that one <em>Roblox </em>experience created by A.S.S. which recreates the 2022 Uvalde shooting features NPCs that resemble children who will hide under desks and play dead when they hear gunfire.</p><p>Most of the experiences created by the studio reportedly end when the police arrive. Players can then fight to the death or commit suicide. </p><h2 id="h414434"><a id=""></a><em>Roblox</em> removes content, but it keeps coming back</h2><p>A.S.S. has struggled to keep their maps available in <em>Roblox </em>as the company removes them quickly when they are reported or get flagged by internal moderation tools. The studio, which boasts a Discord server containing over 500 members, has resorted to using private <em>Roblox </em>servers to host their games behind a paywall. The idea is that this makes it harder for Roblox Studio to find and remove the games, all of which reportedly break many of <em>Roblox’s </em>community guidelines and rules.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/roblox-user-group-re-creates-real-life-mass-shooting-events?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTI2NTU2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1ODcwMzYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVZQOUdEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.P4kaO2hTr9-7PKAgfwWFdDRJ3hKkYOt2_k7LAjKIfa8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/roblox-user-group-re-creates-real-life-mass-shooting-events?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTI2NTU2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1ODcwMzYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVZQOUdEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.P4kaO2hTr9-7PKAgfwWFdDRJ3hKkYOt2_k7LAjKIfa8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a></span> that <em>Roblox </em>has removed one of A.S.S’s groups which contained over 800 players after it was contacted by the ADL.

In some cases, they may also encounter content produced by accelerationist white supremacists, which glorifies these killers and aims to radicalize others to follow in their footsteps.”</p><p><em>Roblox, Discord, </em>and <em>TikTok </em>each told <em>Bloomberg</em> that they actively remove content focused on or glorifying extremists  or violent crimes. Despite that, <em>Kotaku</em> was able to find numerous videos about “Carbine” and other digital recreations of school shootings on these platforms.

While everyone treated the Royal Rumble as a formality for Cena to get to WrestleMania, Chief Content Officer Triple H (we’ll get to him later) and the WWE writers were still able to generate shock within this predictable rollout by not only having Cena be eliminated at the end of the Royal Rumble, but also by putting fan favorite Jey Uso onto a well-deserved championship track.

Travis Scott was high and giving Rhodes a black eye. Cena being chosen to be the face of the company by the insidious Vince McMahon was brought up, as was Rhodes only being in the position he is because of Cena’s absence and Rhodes copying him. Everything was set. All that was left was for Cena and Rhodes to put on the historic WrestleMania matches they’ve been known to do individually. Boy, did they not.</p><p>After uninspired fisticuffs, the match devolved to simply an exchange of finishing moves before concluding in one of the weakest endings in WrestleMania history. After getting his lick back on Travis Scott by hitting the Cactus Jack rapper with a Cross Rhodes, the champion wouldn’t strike Cena with the championship belt. Why? By the look on his face, it appears he didn’t want to win the wrong way. Well, that Captain America nobility bullshit got him kicked in the groin and knocked out, making him the loser of the match. No surprise interference outside of Travis Scott, no ruthless aggression, no sustained back-and-forth fighting. It was the equivalent of the WWE shoving the full-course meal you ordered in your face and telling you to enjoy what you asked for. At a WrestleMania that featured Seth Rollins’ surprise alliance with Paul Heyman; Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair putting on an instant classic triple-threat match; and Jey Uso winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Cena’s title match would be an afterthought if not for the history made. </p><p>Even with all of that disappointment, I’m not ready to give up on the WWE’s grand plan. The most promising sign that the WWE has a worthwhile plan which that terrible WrestleMania 41 main event fits into is Cena’s expressed desire to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruin wrestling</a></span>.” Earlier today on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pat McAfee Show</em></a></span>, Cena broke down part of his post-WrestleMania plan, and it quite honestly sounds like the WWE’s version of DC Comics’ Crisis on Infinite Earths in which the DC timeline was reset, liberated of its burdensome multiverse.</p><p>“I’m going to make wrestling start over. That championship is coming home with me, and I will be the last undisputed WWE champion, period. They’re going to have to make a new title. They’re going to have to start the over again.”</p><p>Retiring a championship is truly next-level heel shit. Beating someone to a bloody pulp, knocking someone off of a bridge, and nailing the boss’s daughter to a cross to sacrifice her are bad. Having the balls to remove a championship is a seismic change that could be a smart move. Cena delivering a WrestleMania match that felt like a formality more than a fight and robbing fans of the type of five-star match that requires you to put your body on the line could totally be Cena’s way of ruining wrestling. Imagine if the rest of his wrestling career is centered on simply removing everything positive that fans expect every year, and then leaving with a title they have memories attached to. That would be a scorched Earth plan I can get behind.</p><p>Another saving grace for the WWE is time. Cena has already committed to wrestling until the end of December, with another 27-37 matches left to go after originally stipulating he’ll wrestle in 30-40 matches in his final year. So far, he’s only wrestled in Premium Live Events. If he’s going to hit that number of matches, it’s safe to assume we’ll be seeing him wrestle on RAW and Smackdown. With the championship already won, the next eight full months can be a collection of dream matches and title defenses. Maybe Cena can finally beat Roman Reigns in a Singles match after failing the previous two times. Maybe the sleeping giant Randy Orton goes back to his Legend Killer ways and begins his own potential retirement tour by ending Cena’s with a loss. </p><p>We’ll almost certainly get a Cena/Rhodes rematch, or we’ll riot. If Cena and WWE’s plans are for the newly 17-time World Champion to ruin wrestling, they’re off to a great start.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I wouldn’t blame you for thinking that sounds like a hassle, but the mantle’s second stage makes it worth it..</p><p><strong>Repeatedly landing attacks with the Corrupted Mantle equipped will further increase your affinity by another five-percent, increase your attack power by five-percent, and remove the health-reducing debuff.</strong> That means you can enjoy all the buffs without the penalty, but you’ll have to work for it. While it’s unfortunate that the in-game description doesn’t provide proper stats or an explanation of the weapon enhancements, not mentioning that the sole debuff can be removed by landing attacks is tantamount to misinformation. Being able to remove that single flaw is what makes this such a great item.</p><p>The Corrupted Mantle admittedly isn’t as strong as it was in previous <em>Monster Hunter </em>games. You used to receive a 30-percent Affinity increase and a 10-percent attack power increase before the update. It even lasted an extra 30 seconds on top of all that. Still, even with the nerfs and the new minute-and-a-half duration, you can shave off a lot of health from whatever beast you’re hunting.

Thankfully, it doesn’t take that many attacks to trigger the second stage. Keep in mind that activating it when face-to-face with a monster might not work out if they’re able to hit you or if they start leaving the area. I instead suggest using it during the following situations:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Before starting a hunt with a sneak attack</li><li>Right before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276">destroying a wound</a></span> with a focus strike</li><li>When a monster falls into a trap</li><li>When a monster is knocked down</li></ul><p>All of these situations will provide you with plenty of time to bring out the full power of the Corrupted Mantle. If you want to maximize your damage further, try to time your usage soon after the monster migrates to a new area. The last thing you want is to waste away the potential for big damage by chasing after a flying Rathalos.</p><hr><p>Mantles are meant to be powerful assets that come at the cost of long recharge times. Even with that and the initial health-reducing debuff, the Corrupted Mantle is a formidable option. I wholeheartedly recommend trying it out and having some fun while you challenge the toughest monsters you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What blurry, barely comprehensible mess was I getting myself into by loading this game on Valve’s handheld device? What horrors of technology was I about to behold by exploring how <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>performed as a portable experience?</p><p>With my expectations set so low you could trip over them, I was overjoyed to see that <strong>Ubisoft put in work to get <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>running pretty darn well on the Steam Deck.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, <strong>you’ll feel the device struggle to keep up with the game at times</strong>, which we’ll get to below. But as far as the moment to moment gameplay goes? Naoe and Yasuke actually resemble the way they look on their home console counterparts. <strong>You’ll hold fast at around 30 FPS even in intense combat sequences</strong>. You’ll still admire the vast open world from tall viewpoints and see trees blow in the wind. It is, against all odds, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on the Steam Deck, and it performs remarkably well for a AAA game in 2025..</p><p>For a more detailed breakdown, read on to see if you should play <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> primarily or secondarily on the Steam Deck. Note that these impressions are based on an 512 gb LCD Steam Deck, so performance on a newer OLED Steam Deck may be slightly better.</p><h2 id="h416835"><a id=""></a>You (mostly) don’t need to toggle any settings for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck</h2><figure id="" data-id="c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-recommend-id="image://c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe crouches in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Naoe crouches in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-recommend-id="image://c408d114251b8b5eb37160a9dbaab001" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe crouches in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>’ success on the Steam Deck can be attributed to how Ubisoft preloaded the graphical settings on the device. In many cases, games on the Steam Deck load up with most graphical toggles set to low, and the Deck will handle that as best as it can. This can result in unreadable text and indecipherable visuals, as most PC and console games aren’t designed with a smaller 1200 by 800 resolution in mind. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, on the other hand, has most of its settings fine-tuned for the device; you can’t even fiddle with most of them yourself. It’s similar to how you typically don’t have to worry about toggling ambient occlusion or shadow detail when you play a game on your PS5.. </p><p>Truthfully, you probably can’t change these settings because the game (and your Steam Deck) would explode if you tried cranking everything too high. But it’s clear that what’s behind the scenes is solid. </p><figure id="" data-id="2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-recommend-id="image://2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC speaks to a character off-screen during a cinematic sequence." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An NPC speaks to a character off-screen during a cinematic sequence." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-recommend-id="image://2884ec10a14bdfe80650c928a7f1fbd8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC speaks to a character off-screen during a cinematic sequence." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a handful of settings that you <em>can </em>edit, but given the game’s optimization I didn’t feel compelled to change them. I initially thought the reduced <strong>field of view</strong> would bother me, but in practice it fits the Steam Deck’s screen well. In fact, if you want a small bump in performance, you can tune this even lower without severely compromising your play experience. Similarly, <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </strong></em><strong>actually supports the Steam Deck’s 16:10 screen</strong>, but you can lower this to the standard 16:9 for a little frame-rate boost as well. I’d personally advise against this, though. Games don’t often fill the Steam Deck screen, so I say you should enjoy it whenever you can—especially if you have an OLED model.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-recommend-id="image://9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke runs forward through the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yasuke runs forward through the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-recommend-id="image://9c47b1a7dc0d67b73a545d840e2616b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke runs forward through the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Frame Generation is one setting you may want to consider changing. </strong>With this feature enabled, you can get upwards of 20 extra frames per second on the Steam Deck, even if they’re “fake frames.” This can make the game look a bit fuzzy, and you might notice weird artifacts during cutscenes, but the extra smoothness is undeniable and might be worth putting up with. That said, this does make the frame rate jump around, whereas you generally play at a consistent 30 FPS with Frame Generation off. There’s no right answer for how to set this, so test both yourself and see which option feels better.</p><h2 id="h416836"><a id=""></a>How does Assassin’s Creed Shadows run on Steam Deck?</h2><p>Despite my high praise so far, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>does make noticeable performance concessions on the Steam Deck. You’ll notice this the second you open the game, as the animation leading into the main Animus menu can chug to the point of making you wait longer to start the game. You may also find yourself needing to log back into Ubisoft Connect if you switch devices frequently, but that’s not exactly a Steam Deck issue.</p><figure id="" data-id="2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-recommend-id="image://2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke fights hostile forces in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yasuke fights hostile forces in the snow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-recommend-id="image://2f61a360799b44c04ff7e9680a526396" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yasuke fights hostile forces in the snow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For better or for worse, <strong>cutscenes seem to be where <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>struggles most on the Steam Deck</strong>. Scenes can dip down to 20 frames-per-second, which even the most frame-insensitive person should notice. The visuals themself are usually fine, fortunately, and the game doesn’t desync from the audio or anything like that. It’s just not quite “console-quality,” at times. </p><p>Fortunately, <strong>in instances where you’re actually <em>playing </em>the game, things move <em>way </em>smoother</strong>. As mentioned above, you’ll rarely if ever experience frame dips below 30 FPS. It doesn’t matter if you’re in climactic story battles as Yasuke or sneaking around busy castles as Naoe, it all holds up well. With Frame Generation on, I typically pushed up to around 40 FPS, with occasional dips back to 30 FPS and spikes up to 50 FPS. Getting headshots with my Kunai or reading enemy telegraphs in packed crowds could get dicey, but that’s to be expected when playing on a small screen. Otherwise, I rarely felt impeded in my ability to play the game.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> manages to retain its visual identity well on the Steam Deck. Even with the settings turned down, buildings and character models look crisp, and you can still appreciate how you’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-customization-unlock-1851772163&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-customization-unlock-1851772163">customized your hideout</a></span> and main characters. I did find the dynamic resolution made enemies in congested towers a bit too blurry, but those were the only moments where I thought the game looked bad. For the most part, I’d say <strong>the performance here feels similar to how <em>The Witcher 3</em> feels on Switch: compromised, but ultimately impressive given the hardware.</strong></p><h2 id="h416837"><a id=""></a>Should you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck?</h2><figure id="" data-id="17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-recommend-id="image://17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe looks out at a snowy landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Naoe looks out at a snowy landscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on an LCD Steam Deck.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-recommend-id="image://17a9a78823607635d3b1f2eff6427e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Naoe looks out at a snowy landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Obviously, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>was meant to be played on a modern console or a capable PC. Those platforms are where you’ll appreciate the visual flourishes Ubisoft Quebec put into the game. And while it looks good on the Steam Deck, you’ll be keenly aware that this world should look more alive than it does. Given how the game already pushes the Steam Deck to its limit, there isn’t any headroom to make the game pop if you dock your device and play on a TV either.</p><p>Still, despite all the compromises, if you’re wondering if you could play <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>primarily on your Steam Deck, I’d say “go for it.” I’ve found myself gladly reaching for my Steam Deck to do some sneaking around in the comfort of my bed, as <strong>the visual sacrifices feel like an even trade for the convenience of portability</strong>. The UI and text looks great on the device, story and side quests alike were enjoyable, and the open world structure is conducive to pick-up-and-play gameplay. Additionally, cloud saves via Ubisoft Connect should transfer between all devices, so the Steam Deck is a great companion device for your PC or even your PS5 if you feel like double dipping.</p><p><br>I thought <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Steam Deck couldn’t be done.
