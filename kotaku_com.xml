Users will be notified of their involvement via email and can opt in or out of the beta. One big feature being added in the update is the ability to have your PS5 controller sync up to multiple devices and switch between them quickly, no resyncing needed. It’s a nifty feature present on current-gen Xbox controllers and will make it easy to use your PS5 gamepad wirelessly on both your PC and console. But the more interesting news is an upcoming PS5 feature Sony is calling “Power Saver.” </p><p>Power Saver won’t be active in the beta, but will go live for everyone in the future. If users turn the optional feature on, the PS5 console will “scale back performance” while playing certain games in order to lower its power consumption. If games don’t support the feature, it won’t kick in. </p><p>Sony doesn’t go into great detail about what “scale back performance” means, but it does mention in some small print text at the bottom of the post that Power Saver won’t support VR games and that some “gameplay features may be limited.” To me, that seems to imply that you won’t be able to run some games at higher framerates when using Power Saver. And because VR demands high framerates to work, that would make Power Saver unusable. I also wonder if we might see some games turn off raytracing or other intense visual options when Power Saver is activated. </p><p>“At [Sony Interactive Entertainment], we are committed to Sony’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Road to Zero’ environmental plan</a></span>, launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040,” said Sony in the blog post. “We are always exploring how we can contribute to these goals through our products and services.”</p><p>Sony says it will share more details in the near future about Power Saver mode and how it will impact games as we get closer to the option going live. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-feature-power-saver-limit-performance-beta-update-1851786790]]></content:encoded>

The team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-atlus-black-wings-statement-rewards-1851786505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-atlus-black-wings-statement-rewards-1851786505">acknowledged the feedback</a></span> and said it would be responding to it, but stopped short of saying it would be making actual changes to address these problems. Now, the studio has held a livestream to talk about the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://persona5x.com/news/details/000170xtpbmman.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://persona5x.com/news/details/000170xtpbmman.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.2 update</a></span> that goes live tomorrow, and players are saying the team hasn’t actually fixed anything, and in some cases, is only making things worse.</p><p>Some changes the patch brings about do acknowledge issues players have complained about; it adds more login rewards and gifts in response to players getting fewer rewards during their play time, for instance. However, while some rewards were rebalanced to be more in-line with the Chinese version, the patch doesn’t do anything on top of that to compensate for the accelerated schedule, nor does it implement higher chances to pull rare characters in the game’s gacha systems. A major point of contention is that characters are not being added to standard banner (basically the baseline pool of characters you can get when rolling for new Phantom Thieves to add to your party) until they have been in the game for six months. According to the stream, this is because the team wants to “act out of consideration for players” who use premium currency to acquire highly sought after characters, which fans have interpreted as the team saying they want to continue to incentivize players to pay up if they want a better chance of getting those characters.</p><p>“Straight up ‘we only care about people who spend money,’” nightoftheghouls <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “You aren’t supposed to say the quiet part out loud guys.”</p><p>What remains to be seen is if this will be standard procedure for the game moving forward, or if it’s just being applied to some characters released in the game’s first month while the devs continue to adjust its monetization and release roadmap. Fans worry this might make the game a bigger money and time investment while the accelerated rollout is still in place, and create a grindier game with less payoff.</p><p>“So now not only do we have an insane release pace of new characters, we will not be able to get any of the ‘Standard’ characters going forward until at least 5 months from now?” N0tZekken <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in another Reddit thread</a></span>. “Keep in mind that they can actually pull it off for every new character, and they could actually make it worse. What’s preventing them from increasing this to a year if sales are not satisfactory? Wouldn’t be the first time we’ve been lied to in the face by Sega/Atlus.”</p><p>The comments on the live stream VOD are filled with similar disappointment, with several viewers expressing the idea that if the game were to just roll out exactly as it did in China, many of their issues would be fixed. But for now, non-Chinese players are dealing with an accelerated, FOMO-driven game that’s been changed in ways that offer no real benefit. Well, none for players, at least. Atlus stands to gain a lot by forcing players into situations where spending real-world money is the easiest fix. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-livestream-marian-review-bomb-gacha-1851786799]]></content:encoded>

We now know it’s the fastest-selling console launch in the U.S. ever. But the Switch 2 wasn’t the only thing interesting about June 2025's video game sales numbers. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196165" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Research group Circana released its monthly figures on Wednesday, with director Mat Piscatella sharing charts and data in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended thread on Bluesky</a></span>. The Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. alone in June and almost all of those buyers were also playing <em>Mario Kart World</em>. According to Circana, 82 percent of all Switch 2 owners in the country also purchased Nintendo’s new racer, either as a physical copy or through the digital pack-in bundle. The data doesn’t track digital sales of the game, which suggests the real number of<em> Mario Kart World</em> players on Switch 2 is even higher. </p><p>Here are the top-20 best-selling games overall in June 2025:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em></li><li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart World</em></li><li><em>Cal of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li><li><em>Stellar Blade</em></li><li><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></li><li><em>MLB: The Show 25</em></li><li><em>Minecraft </em></li><li><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em></li><li><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></li><li><em>Split Fiction</em></li><li><em>EA Sports FC 25</em></li><li><em>Elden Ring</em></li><li><em>NBA 2K25</em></li><li><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></li><li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></li><li><em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em></li><li><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></li><li><em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em></li><li><em>WWE 2K25</em></li></ol></blockquote><p>Circana also shares a list of the best-selling games on each individual platform but doesn’t break them out between Switch 2 and the older hardware. Instead, both consoles are rolled up into a single “Nintendo platforms” list, at least for now. That makes it hard to get a clear sense of what Switch 2 owners specifically are buying and playing, but not surprisingly the list is dominated by new Switch 2 games and older games that received upgrades like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. Notable Switch 2 releases that didn’t chart include <em>Hitman: World of Assassination </em>and <em>Yakuza 0</em> <em>Director’s Cut</em>. Here are some other interesting takeaways from the data.</p><h2 id="h555430"><a id=""></a><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is still topping the charts</h2><p>FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off is now the best-selling game for two months in a row. That’s especially notable given it’s only $40 and Circana tracks sales by revenue, meaning it’s pulling double duty compared to full-priced games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Interestingly, it’s still only the eighth overall best-selling game year-to-date, but it’s clearly pushed lots of players who apparently hadn’t already purchased<em> Elden Ring</em> to go back and play it, bringing its predecessor back into the top 2o for the month. </p><h2 id="h555431"><a id=""></a><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has completely dropped off</h2><p>Despite being the best-selling game for 2025 overall so far, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> hasn’t charted in either of the last two months. That could suggest some momentum has died down as players bounce off with the lack of post-game content and rapid updates, and/or that PC performance has really stopped the game dead in its tracks on the platform where it was selling the best. It’s still sitting at “overwhelmingly negative” in its recent Steam reviews and the concurrent player count has fallen off more quickly than it did with <em>Worlds</em>. </p><h2 id="h555432"><a id=""></a>Fans can’t get enough of the Switch 2 Pro controller</h2><p>Nintendo’s conventional alternative to the Joy-Con was June’s best-selling gaming accessory. Around 32 percent of Switch 2 owners also picked one up, a number that likely would have been higher if the controller hadn’t kept selling out everywhere. Some fans have called it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l5dk80/is_the_switch_2_pro_controller_worth_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l5dk80/is_the_switch_2_pro_controller_worth_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best controller ever made</a></span>, but its popularity also probably speaks to just how many people play their Switch 2 docked and are tired of compromising that living room experience with sub-par Joy-Con controllers, even the upgraded ones for the Switch 2. </p><h2 id="h555433"><a id=""></a><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> was a surprise hit </h2><p>The long-running RPG life sim series that started on the DS was a console exclusive on Switch 1 and 2 last month (it also came to PC) and ended up making the top 1o. It’s hard to know how many of those players were on Switch 2, but the game was the third best-selling across both Nintendo platforms, just behind <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and ahead of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. I preferred<em> Fantasy Life i </em>myself, but it shows how Nintendo continues to benefit from rolling handheld and console-like experiences into a single device. </p><h2 id="h555434"><a id=""></a>It’s the summer of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> on Xbox</h2><p>We hear a lot about<em> World of Warcraft</em> and<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em>, but much less about Bethesda’s ongoing MMORPG which just crossed its 11th year out in the wild. It was the second best-selling game on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One last month. A big part of that is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a major update and new seasonal storylines</a></span> that went live for the game in June, but another factor is probably the release of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier in the year and returning fans looking for more reasons to hang around in Tamriel.<em> ESO</em> was the second best-selling game on the platform last month as well. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-elden-ring-nightreign-1851786793]]></content:encoded>
