              <p>Smart lighting turns any room from ordinary to extraordinary with a tap of your phone. Philips Hue lightstrips tuck behind TVs, under cabinets, along staircases or around ceiling edges to create ambient glow that sets the perfect mood. The trick is buying several to really tie a space together and Black Friday finally makes that affordable: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/">has dropped the 10-foot <em>Solo</em> light strip to $46, down from $76 (40% off)</a>. This is the lowest price ever recorded and you won’t find Philips Hue discounts anywhere else during this sale period.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5828/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Quality</h2>
<p>Cheap LED strips are flooding the market but Philips Hue earns its reputation through <strong>superior color accuracy and build quality</strong>. That sets this strip apart from basic RGB alternatives that inevitably have issues delivering clean white light. Most budget strips attempt to achieve white tones by blending red, green, and blue LEDs together which is what causes that weird purple or green tint you’ve probably seen. Philips includes dedicated warm and cool white LEDs solely to deliver pure, natural whites alongside the full color spectrum.</p>



<p>Brightness counts when you’re lighting up larger spaces, and the <strong>Philips light strip delivers 1700 lumens of output</strong>. That’s enough to serve as functional accent lighting rather than just decorative glow. You can use it as under-cabinet task lighting in the kitchen or soft ambient illumination behind a media center. The premium silicone sleeve with a milky white finish diffuses the light for even dispersion, eliminating those harsh LED hotspots that make cheaper strips look cheap.</p>
<p>Installation takes minutes with the adhesive backing built into the strip: Just peel off the protective layer, stick it where you want it, and plug it in. You can cut this strip to size for your particular space, but you won’t be able to reconnect the pieces once they’re cut. Do your planning in advance to save a headache. The 10-foot length works perfectly for TV backlighting, bed frames, desk setups, or shorter ceiling runs around a room.</p>
<p>The Philips Hue app unlocks your lightstrip’s full potential once you’re all set up. You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors and adjust brightness levels</strong> to your liking with real precision. Once you start creating scenes that match your activities, it gets addictive: Be it movie nights with a warm orange glow, morning routines with energizing daylight tones or late-night gaming with deep purple ambiance-all in one strip.</p>



<p>Voice control integration through A<strong>lexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit works seamlessly</strong>. Telling your speaker to dim the lights or change colors feels genuinely futuristic the first few times you do it. Hands-free control proves especially useful when you’re cooking, lounging on the couch, or turning in for bed. The lightstrip responds quickly to commands with no noticeable lag. You can also group it with other smart devices for coordinated whole-home automation.</p>
<p>Adding a Philips Hue Bridge extends the functionality of your lightstrip even further: The Bridge enables various forms of automation such as having the lights sync with sunrise and sunset times, or having specific scenes turn on when you arrive home. It offers you much more stable connectivity and allows for control from anywhere through the cloud. Compatible with Matter, your Hue system will work seamlessly with other smart home ecosystems.</p>
<p>At $46, this Philips Hue Solo light strip is a great value in premium smart lighting. You’re getting true RGBWW color accuracy, impressive 1700-lumen brightness, seamless smart home integration, and the reliability of an established brand.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-favorite-memories-mw2-bastion-halo-2000646286</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Mountain Dew green colors. The loud marketing campaigns. The Xbox 360 felt like Microsoft trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-mtv-special-20-years-elijah-wood-future-gaming-1851780248">but its way</a> into the console gaming big leagues. Through the unexpected collision of developer-friendly tech, consumer affordability, and digital-first initiatives, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-console-update-more-ads-20-years-old-series-x-1851785111">Xbox 360</a> organically bootstrapped its way into being one of the best consoles ever.</p> <p>It didn’t just capture the late 2000s gaming imagination, it defined the zeitgeist and forged experiences that feel as formative as the early days of the NES or PlayStation 1. To mark the console’s 20th anniversary and lasting impact, here are the Xbox 360 memories that still stick with us:</p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>1.</strong> The first time I earned an in-game achievement, something clicked in my brain. I believe it was for completing the training level in </span><i><span>Call of Duty 2</span></i><span>. I remember how nice it felt to get a little pop-up reward from the game. I then spent the next many, many years collecting achievements on Xbox 360, subjecting myself to games like </span><i><span>Full Auto</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Perfect Dark Zero</span></i><span> in the hunt for more points. And while I think achievements aren’t that exciting anymore, I do still love the idea of having this record of things I’ve played and done across now three generations of Xbox consoles. I’m happy every other platform stole this idea, too. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>2.</strong> When the incredible </span><i><span>Pac-Man Championship Edition </span></i><span>came out, I became embroiled in a fierce high score battle with a few acquaintances. Every night I’d get home from work to see that one of them had just barely slipped past me, and so I’d lose myself for hours in the neon vibes and clubby beats of its arcade action, relying on pure instinct, trying again and again and again until I finally secured my victory over them on the leaderboards. It was pure arcade bliss. (Carolyn Petit)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>3.</strong> The first and last time I ever ordered a pizza on a video game console happened in 2013. Pizza Hut launched an app on the Xbox 360 and offered a promotion that let you get a pizza for 15 percent off. I ordered a pepperoni pie, stuffed-crust of course, and consumed it while playing B</span><i><span>lack Ops 2.</span></i><span> Little did I know life would rarely be this good again. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>4.</strong> My first 360 memory was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-tdu-x360">Tom Bramwell</a> bringing his pre-release machine over to my flat before it was out, and we played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-condemned-pc"><em>Criminal Oranges</em></a> and <em>Kameo</em> and worried for the machine’s chances. </span><span>But then after that, all <em>Geometry Wars</em>, all the time. (John Walker)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><strong>5.</strong> My girlfriend’s roommate’s boyfriend moved into their apartment during the last year of college. He had an Xbox 360 with <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. I slept over often staying up with him until one or two in the morning fighting Juggernauts in Special Ops missions and running Model 1887 Akimbo through Terminal while drinking a case of Lion’s Head. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>6.</strong> It might sound silly now, but </span><i><span>Gears of War 3 </span></i><span>is burned into my brain because of one character’s death. Late in the game, spoilers for those who haven’t played it, Dom sacrifices himself to save Marcus and the others from doom. My brother and I had played through the first two games multiple times and had developed a connection with this world and the characters. He was always Dom. I was always Marcus. And there was something oddly compelling and sad about watching my digital brother sacrifice himself to save me. (Zack Zwiezen)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>7.</strong> I’m still chasing the high of that first <em>Dungeon Defenders</em>. It came to XBLA in late 2011 when I was living in my first apartment after college. My best friend and I were hooked on the tower defense RPG loop, hoovering up crystals and maxing every character. I’ve never played anything as intensely since. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p> <hr> <p><span><strong>8.</strong> The foundational memory I have of the Xbox 360 was that, when the box launched in 2005, I wasn’t allowed to play it. My twin brother and I got one the following January because they were on back order, so I spent a couple months staring wistfully at the games we’d bought ahead of time. But I had recently failed my seventh-grade math class with a 64, and rather than investing in tutoring or anything to support me in a subject I clearly struggled with, my mother decided to punish me by not allowing me to play the shiny new console. </span></p>

 <p><span>I still did, obviously. I just waited until my mother went to sleep. I beat </span><i><span>Kameo: Elements of Power </span></i><span>in the dead of night and honed my skills in </span><i><span>Dead or Alive 4</span></i><span> when no one was awake to notice. My mother eventually found out because my local youth minister was a narc and was listening in on every conversation my friends and I were having. But I beat 360 games months earlier than I was supposed to. In retrospect, that was a lot of drama for something so insignificant as a middle school math class. But hey, those late-night play sessions were worth it. (Kenneth Shepard)</span></p> <hr> <p><strong>9.</strong> I borrowed <em>Catherine</em> from a friend and played it at the exact time my girlfriend and I were on a break over my own commitment issues. That precise combination of puzzle platforming panic, existential dread, and demonic nightmares will never leave me. I can still hear the music as Vincent sits in the bar bathroom watching his low-stakes life unravel over text message. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

 <hr> <p><span><strong>10.</strong><i> Halo 3</i></span>. I don’t think there’s ever going to be a multiplayer experience quite like that one again. I have many good memories of killer matches and chill hang out sessions. But I’ll always remember when folks started spotting players wearing the “Recon” helmet and were obsessed over trying to figure out how to unlock it long before the armor piece became available to the public. Me, being the kind of person I was at the time (and maybe still am?) would often hop onto social, unranked matches to try and convince people I knew how to get the armor. No, I didn’t scam them. I just wasted their time, taking them to various corners of the game’s maps and asking them spin around in circles, empty all their ammo in the corner, stand on top of each other to build a ladder to where I promised them the Recon armor was hiding, or recite strange cryptic sounding sentences I made up on the spot. I’m sorry if you were one of those people whose time I wasted. But it was really, really funny to me. Thanks for the memories. (Claire Jackson)</p> <hr> <p><strong>11.</strong> Waiting for <em>Bastion</em> to come to XBLA’s Summer of Arcade felt like being back in the ’90s. Digital downloads still felt novel. They were giving birth to an entirely new generation of retro-inspired indie giants. I played it my SD TV left over from college up in my parent’s attic during July with no air conditioning. I was still sweating even in the middle of the night as Logan Cunningham raspy voice unfurled a broken world hope, despair, and beautiful colors. It felt like I was looking at the past and the future simultaneously. <span>(Ethan Gach)</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-nuclear-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-now-cheaper-than-budget-alternatives-2000646499</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The noise-cancelling headphones market has become incredibly crowded with Sony, Bose, Apple, Sonos and others fighting for your attention. Each brand also offers multiple models at many different price points and if I’m being honest, the differences between them have gotten increasingly tough to justify.</p>
<p>At a certain point, when premium ANC headphones are all performing fantastically, the smartest move is finding the best deal and pulling the trigger. And the great news is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">that the Bose QuietComfort headphones have dropped to $199 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>. That’s 43% off a legendary pair of cans, and the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on these.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Name That Defined Noise Cancellation Still Delivers</h2>
<p><strong>Bose invented the category of consumer noise-cancelling headphones</strong> and has refined the QuietComfort line over decades. That heritage shows in how effortlessly these headphones eliminate ambient noise: the hum of airplane engines, office chatter, city traffic, and noisy coffee shops-all just fade into silence when you put them on. At the same time, the ANC technology automatically changes intensity with your surroundings, increasing or decreasing as needed.</p>



<p>Sound quality lives up to the Bose <strong>reputation for rich, balanced audio</strong>. Deep bass hits with authority without overwhelming mids and highs, which keeps music sounding natural across genres. Acoustic tracks feel intimate while electronic and hip-hop deliver the punch you’d expect. Bose tuned these headphones to sound great out of the box<strong> without requiring EQ adjustments</strong>, though the app lets you tweak things if you want.</p>
<p><strong>With 24 hours of battery life</strong>, you can make it through an entire week of commutes and work sessions on a single charge. When you’re in a rush, a quick 15-minute top-up adds roughly 2.5 hours of playtime. USB-C charging keeps things suitably simple and compatible with the cables you already own. Should you somehow manage to drain the battery completely during a long-haul flight, the headphones also work in wired mode.</p>
<p>Comfort is a huge factor when you’re having to wear headphones for long periods of time, and Bose really nailed the ergonomics here. The<strong> plush ear cushions create a seal without excessive clamping pressure</strong> against your head. The headband distributes weight evenly around your head, so you won’t feel soreness building up after a few hours. It feels premium in terms of build without being heavy, treading a nice line between durability and wearability.</p>



<p>The <strong>on-board microphone handles calls clearly</strong> enough for professional conversations. Colleagues and family members will hear you sans that muffled, distant quality that plagues many Bluetooth headphones. Wind noise reduction helps when you’re taking calls outdoors or in less-than-ideal conditions. It won’t replace a dedicated desktop setup for podcasting, but the mic performs quite well for everyday voice communication.</p>
<p>Bluetooth connectivity has been rock solid in real-world use: <strong>the headphones pair quickly</strong> and connections have remained stable even in busy wireless environments. Multipoint pairing lets you stay connected to two devices at once, perfect for toggling between your laptop and your phone. The Bose app offers further customizations, including adjustable EQ, ANC levels, and shortcut button assignments.</p>
<p>At $199, the Bose QuietComfort headphones are outstanding value in the premium ANC category. You’re getting legendary noise cancellation, refined sound quality, all-day battery life, and exceptional comfort from a brand that pioneered this entire product segment.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-full-chaos-mode-on-the-delta-2-power-station-1800w-of-portable-power-for-pocket-change-2000646495</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-goes-full-chaos-mode-on-the-delta-2-power-station-1800w-of-portable-power-for-pocket-change.1361698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The portable power station market gets fiercely competitive during Black Friday, with brands like <em>Jackery</em> and <em>Anker</em> dropping prices to the $350-400 range. Here’s the thing though: most of those deals cap out at 1,500W output. Ecoflow just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">changed the equation by slashing the Delta 2 to $349, down from $699</a> and you’re getting here <strong>1,800W of continuous power</strong> for less than competitors charge for their smaller units. This<strong> 50% discount marks the all-time lowest price</strong> for a power station in this performance class, and it probably won’t last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Raw Power That Competitors Can’t Match at This Price</h2>
<p>The 1,800W output puts the Delta 2 in a different league than most portable power stations in this price range. That extra 300W compared to 1,500W competitors might sound modest on paper but it opens up a whole new category of appliances you can run. Power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, and small space heaters suddenly become viable options. The <strong>2,700W surge capacity</strong> handles startup spikes from compressors and motors without breaking a sweat. You’re essentially getting mid-tier performance at entry-level pricing.</p>



<p>The 1,024Wh capacity provides enough juice to keep your essentials running during extended outages or off-grid adventures. A full charge can power a mini fridge for about a day or keep your phones and laptops topped up for a week. Ecoflow designed the Delta 2 to be expandable too, so you can add extra batteries down the line if your needs grow.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry gives the Delta 2 a serious longevity advantage over traditional lithium-ion power stations: This type of battery maintains over <strong>80% capacity after 3,000 charge cycles which translates to roughly a decade of regular use</strong>. The chemistry is also inherently safer with better thermal stability and reduced fire risk. You can store it in your garage or RV without worrying about temperature extremes causing problems.</p>



<p>Charging speed is where EcoFlow really flexes its engineering muscle: The <strong>Delta 2 goes from empty to 80% in just 50 minutes</strong> using a standard wall outlet, with no bulky external brick required. Solar charging maxes out at 500W input, so a couple of panels can fully recharge the unit in a few hours on a sunny day. You can even combine AC and solar charging simultaneously for maximum speed. That rapid turnaround keeps you powered up and ready to go when time matters.</p>
<p>The port selection covers pretty much every charging scenario you might encounter. <strong>Six AC outlets handle your larger appliances and power tools, while the 100W USB-C port delivers laptop-level charging speeds</strong>. Four additional USB-A ports and a 12V car outlet round out the options. Everything can run simultaneously without juggling or prioritizing devices. The built-in display shows real-time input and output wattage along with remaining capacity.</p>
<p>At $349, the EcoFlow Delta 2 delivers unmatched value in the portable power station category. You’re getting 1,800W output, LiFePO4 durability, ultra-fast charging, and expandable capacity for less than competitors charge for inferior specs. This Black Friday deal essentially gives you a $700 power station at half price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-tv-backlight-is-going-for-pocket-change-netflix-hits-different-with-lights-that-react-to-your-screen-2000646475</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-tv-backlight-is-going-for-pocket-change-netflix-hits-different-with-lights-that-react-to-your-screen.1361677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Philips Hue dominated the smart lighting space but Govee quietly stole the crown by innovating faster and pricing lower than the legacy giant could match. The brand brings fresh ideas into connected lighting that Hue never considered, <strong>like TV backlights which react in real-time to on-screen content</strong>.</p>
<p>Govee <em>TV Backlight 3 Lite</em> wraps colors around your television that match what you’re watching, crafting immersive viewing that makes regular TVs feel incomplete. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">dropped this to $46 for Black Friday, down from $69, a record low that brings cinema-style ambiance to any living room</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Camera Sync Technology Matches Colors Instantly</h2>
<p>It has a <strong>built-in camera that would capture your TV screen and analyze colors in real time</strong> and projects matching hues onto the wall behind. Explosions glow orange across your wall, ocean scenes spread blue throughout the room, and forests extend green beyond the screen edges. This reactive lighting creates immersion that static backlights cannot achieve, pulling you deeper into whatever you’re watching. The fish-eye correction function improves color accuracy along the edges where older systems struggled.</p>



<p>Full compatibility means the system <strong>works with any TV content from whatever source</strong>. Streaming services, cable boxes, gaming consoles, and Blu-ray players all work easily without special setup or compatibility concerns. The camera captures whatever appears on screen without requiring HDMI passthrough or software integration.</p>
<p>This universal approach avoids the frustration of backlights only working with specific apps or devices. Gravitational hanger design facilitates camera installation on ultra-thin TVs, difficult to achieve with traditional mounts. The camera hangs securely, and adhesive stabilization inhibits wobble that would affect color detection accuracy.<strong> Installation takes minutes</strong>&nbsp;as opposed to the complicated mounting other systems require.</p>
<p>Govee <em>DreamView</em> syncing <strong>connects up to seven additional Govee lights for a 360-degree immersive experience</strong>. Floor lamps, table lights, and more from Govee also sync with your TV backlight to extend the color matching of your room.</p>



<p>Smart control via the Govee Home app supports scene modes, eliminates black bars, and detects a blank screen. You’ll be able to change settings, set custom scenes, and fine-tune the experience from the comfort of your couch. Voice control via Alexa and Google Assistant allows for hands-free operation to make any necessary quick adjustments during viewing.</p>
<p>You’re getting camera-synced reactive lighting with fish-eye correction and DreamView compatibility at $46, which is 33% off. Philips Hue Play gradient strips offer less flexibility with similar functionality and will set you back a minimum of US$200. With real-time color matching, multi-device syncing, and universal compatibility, the end result is cinema immersion at a fraction of the premium alternatives.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-best-worst-arcade-games-netflix-store-closing-1851610163">20 years ago on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360</a> and the future of video games was unveiled on MTV, and it was hosted by Elijah Wood. And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on May 12, 2025. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>But before we praise <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it:</p>

  <p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari, some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation.</p>

 <p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <a href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a>. The camera cuts to a…woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode.</p>

  <p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p>

 <p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet.</p>

 <p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad.</p> <p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market.</p>

              <p>Competition in premium headphones has never been as fierce as it is currently with Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats in a heated contest over the over-ear market. Each brand brings legitimate quality to the table which makes choosing sound alone an increasingly difficult decision. The tiebreaker becomes price when comparable products are competing at similar performance, and Beats just made that decision incredibly easy. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/">just crushed the Beats Studio Pro to $149 for Black Friday, down from $349, delivering a 57% discount no competitor can match</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>40-Hour Battery Life Outlasts Every Competitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>battery endurance is up to 40 hours of playback with active noise cancellation on</strong>, beating what Sony, Bose, and Apple offer at any price. You charge these headphones once and use them for an entire week of commuting, working, and exercising without seeing low battery warnings. The extended runtime transforms how you think about wireless headphones since charging becomes a weekly ritual rather than a daily annoyance. Fast Fuel charging adds 4 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging when you forget to plug in overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Lossless audio via USB-C</strong> (paired with compatible sources over cable) provides audio quality that even an audiophile can appreciate. Wired mode switches off Bluetooth compression entirely, ensuring studio-quality playback that simply can’t be replicated by wireless transmission. Three built-in sound profiles allow the listener to tailor the listening experience to the content or personal preference.</p>



<p>This custom acoustic platform creates rich and immersive sound that is on par with many headphones costing considerably more. The bass response remains controlled without bleeding into midrange frequencies, and the vocals sit clearly atop the mix. High frequencies extend smoothly without any harshness to cause fatigue in long listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Fully adaptive active noise cancellation continuously adjusts based on your environment</strong> and fit on your head. The system monitors external noise and internal seal and optimizes cancellation in real time as conditions change. Transparency mode lets outside sound through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Switching between modes happens instantly through on-ear controls without interrupting playback.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio with <strong>dynamic head tracking provides a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience</strong>. The system interacts with your head movements and adjusts audio placement to maintain the exact positioning of the sound elements, even as you move your head to either side. This technology works with compatible content to accurately place instruments and vocals in three-dimensional space around you.</p>



<p>Improved compatibility<strong> works seamlessly across both Apple and Android ecosystems</strong>. One-touch pairing connects straight away to iPhones via the Apple chip inside, while similar quick-pairing functionality is in place for Android devices. Native features work across the board, unlike some competitors, where specific operating systems receive the best features.</p>
<p>On-ear controls manage music playback, phone calls, and voice assistant activation without reaching for your phone. The physical buttons offer a type of tactile feedback that touch controls can’t compete with, enabling adjustments to be done without looking or removing the headphones. Siri, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants are activated with the press of a button for hands-free queries.</p>
<p>For $149, you get premium noise-cancelling headphones with 40-hour battery life and lossless audio for 57% off of its MSRP, which puts it below budget competition offering far less value. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra are $300-$400 options that don’t offer near the same level of battery life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>Amazon saves its best Black Friday deals for Prime members</strong>, and this portable monitor shows why the membership pays for itself, quite literally. Non-subscribers see regular pricing, while Prime members unlock exclusive discounts that slash products down to absurd lows. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor handles both <strong>gaming and productivity with a Full HD IPS display</strong> that travels anywhere your laptop goes. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">dropped this to $66 for Black Friday, down from $99, but only Prime members access this record low pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Quality Visuals Anywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display gives 1920×1080 resolution for sharp text and clear images throughout the 15.6-inch display</strong> panel. The IPS technology assures accurate colors and consistent brightness from any viewing angle of up to 178 degrees. You see the same image quality whether you look straight on or from the side, which counts if you do group work or adjustable setups. HDR technology enhances contrast between bright and dark areas, making games and movies look more dynamic. The display reduces blue light radiation and eliminates flickering to protect your eyes against fatigue during extended viewing.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C connectivity enables single-cable connections</strong> that handle video signal and power delivery in tandem on compatible devices. You plug in one cable to laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C 3.1, and the monitor works immediately without external power. The two USB-C ports make way for different device connections and cable routing preferences. Mini-HDMI input accommodates devices lacking USB-C video output, ensuring compatibility with older laptops, gaming consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The<strong> ultra-slim profile of 0.3 inches and a weight of 1.7 pounds</strong>&nbsp;make this portable, rather than just technically portable. You slip this into a laptop bag beside your computer without adding any noticeable bulk or weight. The slim build fits in the same compartments as tablets or thin ultrabooks do. This kind of portability changes the way you think about workspace setup, as bringing a second monitor along becomes simple.</p>



<p>The <strong>included smart cover protects the screen</strong> during transport and converts into an adjustable stand for desktop use. Being budget-friendly, the exterior uses PU leather that resists scratches and feels premium. Two grooves in the bottom of the cover provide different viewing angles for comfort with multiple setups. The magnetic frameless design of this keeps the cover attached securely without adding bulk or interfering with the display.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with gaming consoles</strong> extends the monitor’s usability beyond laptop productivity. You hook up a Playstation 4, Xbox, or Switch directly to this for portable big-screen gaming anywhere. Hotel rooms, guest bedrooms, or any space with a power outlet becomes a gaming station. The native 1080p resolution of the console output is matched and color accuracy from the IPS panel is better than many hotel TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity to your smartphone transforms the monitor into a desktop experience</strong> for your mobile device. You will connect compatible phones via USB-C and expand your mobile workspace into a proper screen size. This feature works great for presentations, video watching, or using mobile apps on larger displays. You need no apps or drivers for this setup; it works immediately via plug-and-play functionality.</p>
<p>Built-in dual speakers provide audio without requiring external speakers or headphones. The sound quality handles video calls, casual entertainment, and basic gaming adequately. <strong>A 3.5mm audio jack</strong> houses headphones or external speakers when you need better audio quality. The speakers add in convenience for quick setups where carrying additional audio equipment isn’t practical.</p>
<p>At $66 for Prime members, you’re getting a full-featured portable monitor with an IPS panel, smart cover, and multi-device compatibility for 34% off. Competing portable monitors with similar specs sell for $100-150 without the included accessories.</p>

              <p>For a long, long time, the premium adventure watch market was dominated by Garmin and Suunto, but then Apple came to the party with the <em>Ultra</em> series and hasn’t looked back since. The <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 competes directly with flagship models from both brands</strong>&nbsp;and adds in smartphone integration that those dedicated sports watches just can’t match.</p>
<p>Apple keeps strict pricing on their own website and in Apple Stores, so it’s a complete waste of your time checking there for deals. But Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/"> just dropped the Ultra 2 to $599 for Black Friday, down from $799, which marks a record low and saves you $200 on Apple’s most rugged wearable</a>. This 25% discount is the deepest cut this watch has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Titanium Construction Survives Everything You Throw at It</h2>
<p>A <strong>49mm case made of titanium</strong> resists corrosion and impacts that would destroy aluminum watches within months of serious outdoor use. The sapphire front crystal laughs at scratches regular glass couldn’t survive, maintaining clarity through years of adventure abuse. Verification through military standard MIL-STD 810H testing shows the watch handles extreme temperatures, shocks, and conditions that exceed those most users ever encounter. <strong>Water resistance reaches a depth of 100 meters</strong>, enabling serious diving alongside swimming and water sports.</p>
<p>The 49mm size provides space for a bigger battery and a more luminous display than standard Apple Watch models have. The <strong>Always-On Retina display peaks at 3000 nits of brightness</strong>, and remains readable under direct sunlight where other screens totally wash out. The larger Digital Crown and customisable Action button work with gloves on, as well as in cold weather where touch-only controls fail.</p>



<p>Precision<strong> dual-frequency GPS</strong> delivers accuracy that serious athletes and navigators require. By utilizing both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies, the system reduces errors from signal reflection off buildings and terrain. The recorded routes of your runs better match the actual paths you run, rather than placing you directly through buildings or zigzagging all over.</p>
<p>The running features compete directly with dedicated running watches from Garmin and Coros. Advanced metrics track running form, including ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and stride length. Automatic track detection senses when you’re running on a standard track and makes adjustments accordingly. Support for custom workouts accommodates structured training, like warmups, intervals, recovery periods, and cooldowns. Training load analysis shows how your workouts are affecting your body over time to help you avoid overtraining.</p>



<p><strong>Cellular connectivity lets you leave your iPhone behind</strong> while maintaining communication capabilities. You call, text, stream music, get directions, and access apps without your phone nearby. That sense of freedom completely changes outdoor activities where carrying a phone would add bulk or create risk. Emergency SOS works anywhere with cellular coverage, providing safety during solo adventures.</p>
<p>That means <strong>battery life reaches 36 hours of normal use with the Always-On display active</strong>, extending to 72 hours of runtime in Low Power Mode for multi-day adventures. This is considerably beyond the typical Apple Watch models and closer to what dedicated adventure watches can manage. The extended battery life makes the Ultra 2 a practical choice for ultra-long hikes, ultra-marathons and multi-day trips in general.</p>
<p>Health monitoring includes tracking heart rate, the measurement of blood oxygen, ECG capability, and sleep analysis. Fall detection and crash detection provide automatic emergency alerts in case of accidents. Temperature sensing tracks overnight variations useful for cycle tracking and illness detection. All of these features run continuously without affecting battery life much.</p>
<p>At $599, you’re getting Apple’s flagship adventure watch with titanium construction and precision GPS for 25% off its standard price. Comparable Garmin watches cost between $800-1000 without the smartphone integration that Apple provides.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro.1361614/</guid>

              <p>MacBook Pro models start at $1,599 which puts Apple’s professional laptops out of reach for many buyers who want quality computing without spending a fortune. The MacBook Air with M4 chip delivers similar performance for everyday tasks at literally half the cost of its Pro sibling.</p>
<p>Apple never discounts products on their own website or in Apple Stores, and keeps strict pricing that forces deal hunters toward third-party retailers. Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air (256GB model) to $749 for Black Friday, down from $999</a>, and marks a record low that <strong>already moved over 10,000 units this month</strong>. This 25% discount represents the kind of Apple savings you simply won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Performance in Air Package</h2>
<p>Housing the most recent Apple silicon architecture,<strong> the M4 processor in the MacBook Air unleashes performance</strong> that increasingly blurs the line separating Air and Pro notebooks. The chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, photo manipulation, and software development without the thermal throttling that plagued Intel MacBooks. The<strong> unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU can share the same 16GB pool efficiently</strong>, and sidestep the bottlenecks traditional systems experience. This level of performance handles professional workflows smoothly, which the previous generations of Air just couldn’t manage well.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> comes built into this M4 MacBook, bringing AI capabilities directly into the operating system. The system helps with writing tasks, image generation, and intelligent assistance without requiring cloud processing for many features. The M4’s Neural Engine processes AI workloads locally and keeps your data private while delivering fast results.</p>



<p>It features a<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and sharp text</strong> for extended work sessions comfortable. This display features P3 wide color gamut for accurate color reproduction that photographers and designers require. This <strong>system comes with 500 nits of brightness</strong> for clear visibility in bright environments without struggling to see content. Bezels remain thin from all sides to retain maximum screen space within the compact chassis.</p>



<p>It’s a 12MP <em>Center Stage</em> camera that provides clear video calls with a<strong>utomatic framing that keeps you centered as you move</strong>. The camera tracks your position and adjusts the frame with optimal composition during video conferencing. That will work across FaceTime, Zoom, and other video applications without manually having to change anything.</p>
<p>Fanless design means <strong>this MacBook runs in complete silence, no matter the workload</strong>. The M4 chip creates such minimal heat that passive cooling takes over the thermal management without mechanical movement. You work in quiet environments such as libraries or late-night sessions without disturbing anyone with the fan noise. This silence is a real advantage compared to Pro models that immediately fire up their fans when doing resource-intensive work.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of typical mixed use</strong>. You can go through a whole day without searching for outlets or managing power settings. This is due to the M4 chip architecture, which brings performance with power-sipping efficiency.</p>
<p>We have Apple’s latest MacBook with an M4 chip and 16GB RAM for $749, which is a straight 25% discount off the original price and makes it half as expensive as entry-level models of the MacBook Pro. For Black Friday, this sale makes current-generation Apple Silicon accessible without compromise or having to settle for older models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-2000646445</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low.1361611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage speed dictates how fast your entire computer feels, from boot times to application launches to game loading. The<strong> Samsung 9100 PRO</strong> is the cutting edge of SSD technology and harnesses <strong>PCIe 5.0</strong> to deliver double the read speeds of previous generation drives.</p>
<p>This kind of performance transforms workflows for gamers, content creators and even professionals running AI workloads that require instant data access. Amazon slashes prices on all three capacities: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 1TB dropped from $199 to $134</a>, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">2TB dropped from $279 to $219</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 4TB dropped from $469 to $369</a>. That means <strong>every capacity hits record low pricing</strong> that makes next-generation storage genuinely accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>14,700 MB/s Read Speed Removes Every Bottleneck</h2>
<p>The resulting sequential <strong>read speed of 14,700 MB/s nearly doubles what the PCIe 4.0 drives</strong> offer and revolutionizes how fast data navigates your system. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch in real-time and large file transfers take place faster than it can process what’s going on. Games with DirectStorage support can load levels in moments rather than the loading screens that define current gaming experiences. What’s more, it actually <strong>far exceeds what most users can currently saturate</strong>&nbsp;which truly means the drive will stay relevant as software catches up to the hardware capability.</p>
<p>The <strong>sequential write speeds match the impressive read performance</strong>, handling large file creation and modifications without slowdowns like cheaper drives experience. To video editors working with 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains responsive, while exports complete in a fraction of the time. For content creators moving huge project files around between drives, transfers finish almost instantly.</p>



<p>The PCIe 5.0 x4 interface leverages four lanes of the latest PCIe standard to achieve these speeds on a compatible motherboard. Intel 13th and 14th generation platforms, along with AMD Ryzen 7000 series, support PCIe 5.0 natively. The M.2 2280 form factor fits standard slots without adapters or special mounting requirements. Older PCIe 4.0 systems run this drive at reduced speeds, still delivering excellent performance while leaving upgrade headroom when you eventually update your platform.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung’s thermal solution is also great and</strong> manages the heat generated by high-speed operation. Included in both the controller and NAND packages are heat spreaders for dissipating thermal energy during sustained transfers. Additional thermal management is provided by systems with dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions.</p>
<p>With this drive,<strong> AI computing workloads benefit considerably from its speed characteristics</strong>. Machine learning models load their training data much faster, and a lesser time is spent waiting for storage. Local AI inference runs more responsively when the models stream from the high-speed storage. In fact, the specifications target AI computing aside from gaming and professional workstations.</p>
<p>At these Black Friday prices, Samsung’s flagship PCIe 5.0 SSD becomes within reach at all capacities. The $134 1TB offers 33% savings, bringing next-gen speed to budget builds. The best value for enthusiasts looking for significant capacity with maximum performance is the $219 2TB. The $369 4TB offers premium storage to pros and power users needing both speed and space.</p>

              <p>Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The <strong>Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring</strong> that disappears on your finger. You forget you’re wearing it within minutes which can’t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/">all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The<strong> 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth</strong> finishes in every ring size.</p>

<h2>Finger-Based Sensors</h2>
<p>The position of a ring on your finger gives<strong> cleaner biometric signals</strong> than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring’s greatest strength</strong>: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed.</p>



<p>It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. <strong>Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels</strong> are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy.</p>
<p>Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body’s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge,</strong> and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you’re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement</strong> throughout the day. It doesn’t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations</strong>, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data.</p>
<p>At $249, you’re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can’t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs pack full desktop functionality into compact cases that disappear behind monitors or tuck into tight spaces where traditional towers won’t fit. The Mac Mini made this form factor popular, but Apple charges premium prices that put compact computing out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kamrui GK3 Plus</strong> provides a similar set of everyday capabilities at a fraction of the cost and performs well at web browsing, office work, streaming and even light photo editing. Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the 16GB/512GB model to $189 for Black Friday, and applying the 10% promo code gets it down to $170 from the usual $229</a>&nbsp;which is a record low that makes desktop computing absurdly affordable.</p>

<h2>Intel N95 Processor Handles Daily Tasks With Ease</h2>
<p>The 12th generation <strong>Intel Alder Lake N95 processor</strong> runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz and boosts up to 3.4GHz when tasks require extra power. Four cores take care of multitasking scenarios like running a browser with multiple tabs while streaming music and working in documents. This chip delivers 35% better CPU performance and 78% improved graphics compared to older N100 and N5105 processors found in competing budget mini PCs.</p>
<p>The integrated Intel UHD Graphics runs 4K video playback, casual photo editing and general desktop work with ease. You will not be editing 4K video timelines or playing demanding games, but everyday computing feels responsive and capable. The graphics output supports three displays simultaneously through dual HDMI ports and a VGA connection.</p>



<p>This 16GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to supply modern computing without slowdowns that plague systems with less capacity. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple applications side by side, and jump between tasks without waiting for content to reload. This amount of memory matches what many premium laptops include and is well above what budget systems often offer. You notice the difference immediately in daily use, where 8GB systems start to struggle with basic multitasking.</p>
<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD stores your operating system and files on fast solid-state storage. Boot times measure in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch quickly without the delays hard drives cause. <strong>Storage expands through an additional 2.5-inch drive bay that accepts SSDs up to 2TB</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s compact,<strong> measuring only 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.96 inches</strong> and it is small enough to mount behind a monitor via an included VESA bracket. This mounting option creates a pseudo all-in-one setup that keeps your desk clean and hides the computer from view. The size makes it perfect for entertainment centers where it connects to TVs for streaming without the bulk of a traditional PC. You escape the limited app selection of smart TVs by running a full Windows installation with access to any streaming service or application.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Gigabit Ethernet for fast wired networking and dual-band WiFi for wireless flexibility. Bluetooth 4.2 interfaces connect wireless peripherals like keyboards, mice, and headphones. The port selection has USB connections for external devices and storage in addition to the video outputs. This connectivity handles typical home and office setups without requiring adapters or hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows is ready to go, right out of the box</strong>.</p>
<p>At $170 with the promo code, you’re getting a complete desktop computer with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for less than most people spend on accessories. Performance won’t be of the same caliber as Apple Silicon, but general computing tasks run smoothly without the premium price tag.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>
