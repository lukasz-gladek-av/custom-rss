            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to be expensive, especially with early Black Friday deals dropping in fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you’re after a modest-sized screen that still delivers on both visuals and sound, here’s some good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">The 2025 model of Samsung’s 40-inch Full HD F6000 Smart TV is currently available on Amazon for just $148, thanks to a 25% discount</a>. It normally retails for close $200, so this deal is taking a good chunk off the price, making the upgrade much more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about entering any weirdly long coupon codes or following some complicated checkout steps to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. It’s also important to note that the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, which means it won’t be around for long. If you’ve been looking to treat yourself to a new screen, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Brilliant, Sharp Visuals for All Your Content</h2>
<p>This screen is not exactly big, which makes it ideal for smaller living rooms and even bedrooms. The sleek profile and slim bezels give it a minimal look while also keeping distractions at bay.</p>
<p>It pushes 1080p Full HD resolution for brighter, sharper visuals. Of course, it won’t rival a 4K screen, but it’s still fairly decent for everyday streaming. There’s High Dynamic Range (HDR) that actively expands the contrast between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene for better color accuracy, plus mega contrast, which automatically adjusts brightness and depth in real time. Watching a nature documentary or streaming your new favorite crime thriller, you’re going to enjoy an immersive viewing experience that pulls you in.</p>



<p>The Object Tracking Sound Lite feature helps the TV simulate directional audio to make it feel more dynamic. It’s pretty solid on its own, but you can always add a compatible Samsung soundbar to improve it even further.</p>
<p>The TV is also powered by Samsung’s One UI Tizen platform, which brings all your major streaming apps into one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">You’re going to have instant access to over 2,700 free channels, including 400+ from Samsung TV Plus.</a> New content is also frequently added, so there’s always going to be something new to watch. Best of all, it also lets you cast your phone to the big screen to scroll, watch shows, and even take video calls.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon-2000645455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon.1358233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wireless headphones solve the tangled cable problem and keep your music private in shared spaces, but dropping $500 on AirPods Max makes zero sense when budget options deliver good daily performance. Most people need reliable Bluetooth audio for commutes and Zoom calls without the premium features that justify four-figure price tags.</p>
<p>Sony’s <strong>WH-CH520 headphones</strong> target practical users who want solid sound quality and marathon battery life without paying for luxury branding. Amazon has dropped<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/"> these already-affordable headphones to $38 for Black Friday, down from their regular $69 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes impulse buying almost mandatory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>50-Hour Battery Life</h2>
<p>The<strong> battery life of 50 hours</strong> means you do not face the constant anxiety associated with premium headphones which boast a capacity of between 20 to 30 hours. You can wear these every day on your commute through an entire workweek without thinking about finding power, then charge over the weekend for another five days of use. Road trips and festival weekends can happen sans charging cables or hunting for outlets between sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>lightweight construction keeps pressure off your head</strong> during those extended wearing sessions that heavier headphones turn into endurance tests. Swivel ear cups rotate to lay flat in bags without taking up excessive space and the the folding design collapses the headphones into a compact form for travel. The adjustable headband accommodates various head sizes without the tight clamping force that causes headaches after an hour of wear.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is above expectation for budget-tier headphones</strong> with well-balanced audio that doesn’t artificially pump up the bass at the expense of mids and highs. The Sony app <strong>includes EQ customization to let you tailor frequency</strong> <strong>response</strong> to your taste or simply make up for any differences in your hearing. You can punch up the bass for hip-hop, emphasize vocals for podcasts, or flatten the curve for classical that sounds better reproduced neutrally. DSEE technology upscales compressed streaming audio, restoring detail that lossy formats discard during encoding.</p>



<p>The built-in microphone does its fair share for phone calls and voice commands, though it is not up to the audio quality of dedicated headsets designed primarily for communication. You can answer calls without pulling your phone from your pocket and keep conversations hands-free while walking or working. The microphone picks up your voice clearly in quiet environments, though noisy settings with traffic or crowds overwhelm the basic noise reduction and require you to speak louder.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity maintains solid connections out to 30 feet</strong> in open spaces, serving typical home and office distances without dropouts. Walls and obstacles reduce effective range, but the headphones remain connected through normal room-to-room movement. Pairing is quick and easy through standard Bluetooth menus without any requirement for apps or complicated procedures; these headphones will work with <strong>Android, iOS, Windows, and any other device that supports Bluetooth</strong>.</p>
<p>At $38 for Sony wireless headphones with 50-hour battery life, you’re paying what knockoff brands charge for products that break within months. This 46% discount turns already reasonable headphones into the most cost-effective audio upgrade available this Black Friday.</p>

              <p>If you’ve already finished <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei</em></a>, then crikey, please can I borrow some of your spare time? I’ve yet to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, let alone even start <em>Yōtei</em>, despite a strong urge to slaughter my way through all that cherry blossom. But for those so far ahead, good news arrives November 24! The game is receiving a free update that’s adding a pretty detailed New Game+ option.</p> <p>At first glance, it appears to be a fairly traditional NG+, allowing you to start the game over once you’ve completed it, but this time with all the equipment and skills you picked up on the way. That comes with new difficulty levels that’ll let you boost the challenge to accompany your greater abilities (although c’mon, you know it’s fun to wait a bit before turning those on and just enjoy being ludicrously over-powered for a little while first), and a couple of new Trophies to earn.</p>

 <p>But it’s adding a whole bunch more than that. Weapons and armor sets are being given a new suite of upgrades to unlock, adding a bunch more motivation to play through again, alongside 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. It’s also adding a whole new in-world currency called Ghost Flowers, which are used to buy these new bits and bobs from a brand new merchant. There’s also a new feature added for the NG+ that’ll offer “stat tracking” as you replay the challenges. You can see a lot of this new stuff in brief glimpses in the trailer:</p>

  <p>Patch 1.100.000 will also come with a few new features for the main game, with a bunch of new doodads for the photo mode, including shutter speed and a composition grid, as well as more silly filters for…for…what <em>does</em> anyone do with these? There are also to be improvements to accessibility, with directional button remapping and other as-yet unrevealed changes. Plus, we assume, a bunch of bug fixes and the like.</p> <p>The co-op multiplayer mode <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-legends-multiplayer-trailer-release-date-2000618559"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei Legends</em></a> and its supernatural take on the events is still a fair ways off, with the ambiguous release date of “2026,” but when it arrives, it too will be free.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Monday, Hypixel announced that it was back from the dead and had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248"><span>acquired the rights to its canceled </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-like game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i></a><span> from Riot. The </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company canceled the game and shut down the developer back in June, and now the band is getting back together, and fans who had been eagerly anticipating the game can look forward to an Early Access launch in the near future. Hypixel has released a lengthy gameplay trailer showing </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>in motion, and if you were looking for a more fast-paced, action-packed version of </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>looks like it might be just that.</span></p> <p><span>The game has a similar blocky art style that will look familiar to anyone who’s ever taken a trip to the Overworld, but the 16-minute gameplay trailer also features a lot of smooth, stylish combat. </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>lets you whack enemies around, too, but it can feel a bit stiff. Which is fine. The best parts of Mojang’s game are its crafting and building mechanics, which more than make up for its simplistic combat. </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, however, looks like it focuses on the inverse. A lot of what Hypixel shows off here is the player using a whole arsenal of weapons. At first, it’s giving </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls </span></i><span>melee combat, but then the game switches to third person, and you see that you have some additional mobility options that make it look a bit more free-flowing.</span></p>  <p><span>Hypixel says it wanted to release footage of the game in motion as quickly as possible to “break the curse” after disappearing for several months, so this is essentially a proof-of-life reveal while the team prepares for Early Access. There’s no set date yet, but the </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post announcement</span></a><span> says that it will be revealed “in the coming days.”</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Drops to Almost Free Ahead of Black Friday, Early Shoppers Are Already Draining Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/snag-the-lego-thestral-family-set-for-just-49-after-a-30-discount-at-amazon-2000645216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-harry-potter-thestral-drops-to-almost-free-ahead-of-black-friday-early-shoppers-are-already-draining-stock.1358128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter introduced us to a whole bunch of cool (and scary) creatures, but few are as quietly haunting as the Thestrals. In fact, these bat-winged creatures are only visible to those who have witnessed or processed death. And now, thanks to LEGO, you can bring a pair home – that too for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/">The Thestral Family set usually retails for $70, but we just spotted it for 30% off on Amazon, which drops the price to just $49</a>. It makes a great holiday gift for the Potterhead in your life, or even a fun treat for yourself if you’re looking to bring key elements of the Wizarding World home. Just note that Amazon has listed it as a limited-time markdown, which is why we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly. The sale is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5694/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>This set is designed for ages 10 and up. You get a total of 548 pieces, which come together to build two posable Thestrals (one adult and one baby), plus a mini Forbidden Forest tree. With under 550 pieces, it won’t exactly be a large project you need to dedicate your entire weekend to, but also not too short.</p>
<p>The attention to detail is impressive on the creatures with striking skeletal forms and distinctive bat-like features. The adult Thestral stands over 9.5 inches tall, and even both come with fabric wings that fold out for flight poses. The head, legs, and wings are articulated, meaning kids can adjust them according to the scene they are trying to recreate. Maybe fold out the wings when it’s roaming through the Forbidden Forest casually, or keep them up when it senses a threat nearby!</p>



<p>Speaking of the Forbidden Forest, the small tree adds to the atmosphere, pulling the set together nicely. Like all LEGO sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, but if you also have the option to install the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. It lets you zoom in on each step, see it from all angles, track your progress, and more.</p>
<p>All things considered, this set can be a great holiday gift for a Harry Potter fan in your life, and you can even get it for yourself. Just be sure to grab it up before the sale expires.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro-2000645418</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-clears-its-macbook-air-m4-to-new-all-time-low-now-officially-2x-cheaper-than-macbook-pro.1358125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple doesn’t do Black Friday promotions, at least on its official website. It prefers to keep prices premium while offloading inventory quietly through Amazon during big sales events. That way, the company preserves its brand image and still moves units at competitive prices via third-party retailers. For Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage drops down to $749 on Amazon from its usual list price of $999</a>, an all-time low. That pricing makes the Air officially half the cost of the base MacBook Pro at $1,599 and creates a value gap which is impossible to ignore.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Performance Without the Pro Price Tag</h2>
<p>The M4 chip brings Apple’s recent silicon architecture to the Air lineup and delivers performance that rivals many Pro models. An eight-core CPU tackles multiple browser tabs and video calls simultaneously without the lag that plagues older Intel-based laptops. The ten-core GPU pushes enough power for casual gaming, 4K video editing in Final Cut Pro and 3D modeling in lighter applications like SketchUp. <strong>Apple Intelligence features run entirely on-device through the Neural Engine</strong> and it processes requests locally rather than sending data to cloud servers for privacy-conscious computing.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is double what Apple was offering in base configurations just two years ago and finally provides some headroom for professional workflows without forcing upgrades that can get very costly. The unified architecture allows CPU and GPU to share this pool of memory dynamically and allocates resources where they’re needed, rather than partitioning the RAM into separate zones.</p>



<p>The<strong> Liquid Retina display measures 13.6 inches, with a resolution of 2560 by 1664 pixels</strong> and up to 500 nits of brightness. That makes text and colors sharp enough for both content creation and consumption. True Tone automatically adjusts white balance according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain during long work sessions. The screen supports P3 wide color gamut for displaying more saturated colors compared to standard sRGB panels, which makes photo editing and design work quite accurate.</p>
<p>This 256GB SSD has enough storage for operating system files, essential applications, and a working library of current projects, although creative professionals accumulating large photo or video libraries will want more external storage. Apple’s SSD delivers sequential read speeds of over 2000MB/s, launching applications and opening files almost instantly under heavy workloads that keep laptops responsive. The speed difference between SSDs and traditional hard drives is still dramatic, eliminating much waiting that used to characterize older laptops.</p>



<p>Going easier,<strong> it lasts up to 18 hours on light tasks like surfing the web</strong> or working in documents – a full workday plus evening use without having to hunt for chargers. It’s about 15 hours of video playback which should get you through the longest cross-country flights with runtime to spare.
