            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s almost a given that as tech devices advance and evolve, they shrink in size. If you’re of a certain age that you once owned one of those massive cathode ray tube monitors, the idea of an affordable portable monitor with a great picture would have been laughable not that long ago. Now, however, ultra-thin FHD screens that fit easily in a backpack or carry-on bag are commonplace, and one of the top-selling models just keeps tumbling in price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">The MNN 15.6-inch FHD portable monitor, which sells over 10,000 units per month at Amazon, is now just $60</a> — a 33% drop from its usual $90, and a spectacular deal for commuters, remote workers, parents, or anyone looking to escape the single-screen setup once and for all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mega-Compatibility</h2>
<p>What makes this $60 portable monitor such a steal isn’t its portability as much as the fact that it’s nearly universally compatible with any device you can think of. The MNN Portable Monitor has USB-C and HDMI ports, and works with PC and Mac laptops and desktops, smartphones and tablets, Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles, Raspberry Pi, and even the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck handheld consoles.</p>
<p>Devices with a full-function USB-C port and Thunderbolt 3 or 3.1 compatibility can connect directly to the MNN monitor with a single cable, and ones lacking a full-function USB-XC port can also connect with a USB-A cable and HDMI cable. Best of all, the MNN Portable Monitor is powered by the device you attach it to, provided it’s a full-function USB-C port. Otherwise it can connect via an external DC 5V, 3A/9V, 2A, or PD 5-20V power adapter.</p>



<h2>Quality To Go</h2>
<p>All that compatibility wouldn’t be worth a lot of the picture was lousy, but this is a brilliant 15.6-inch HDR screen with a 1000:1 contrast ratio, low blue light, 16.7 million colors, and it works in both portrait and landscape modes. The 5ms response time makes it a viable screen for gaming consoles, which makes gaming on the go a reality.</p>
<p>The portability factor is obvious — the MNN portable monitor is barely a third of an inch thick, protected by a durable faux-leather cover that also doubles as a stand, and weighs a shockingly light 1.52 pounds. It’s designed for an easy fit in a backpack, briefcase, or any go-bag you take on the road. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">The limited-time price of just $60 at Amazon is the lowest yet for the MNN 15.6-inch Portable FHD Monitor, and it’s safe to say it’s worth every penny.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/atari-handheld-gamestation-go-preorder-game-list-2000624033</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-atari-handheld-looks-great-but-costs-almost-as-much-as-a-switch-lite.1291608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do we need an Atari gaming handheld in 2025? Definitely not. Do I still really want the Atari Gamestation Go? Absolutely. The retro portable strikes a great balance between ostentatious and sleek, retro and modern. But while the latest Atari machine is full of games from the ’80s, it packs a contemporary price tag of $180.</p> <p>Produced by the folks at My Arcade, the Atari Gamestation Go was first revealed at CES 2025 near the start of the year. It packs a 7-inch high resolution full-color display, a rechargeable battery for 4-5 hours of playtime, and over 200 classics from Atari’s past. Pre-orders went live today at Best Buy and GameStop, with the device shipping sometime in October. Here’s a sample of the game list:</p> <ul> <li><i>Asteroids: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Missile Command: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Centipede: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Breakout: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Berzerk: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Balls of Steel Pinball</i></li> <li><i>PAC-MAN</i></li> <li><i>Breakout</i></li> <li><i>Tempest</i></li> <li><i>Warlords</i></li> </ul> <p>The coolest features by far are the integrated paddle, trak-ball and number pad. Not only do they look really cool with the yellow, tan, orange, and black colorway, they’re also functional for deep-cuts like <em>Codebreakers</em> and <em data-processed="true">Missile Command</em>. Assuming the emulation is decent, the buttons feel good, and the device isn’t uncomfortable to hold, it could end up being one of the best ways to play one of gaming’s often overlooked but historically significant back catalogs.</p>

 <p>The fact that the Atari Gamestation Go&nbsp;<em>only</em> plays old Atari games is probably for the best. What better way to put down the smartphone and purge the algorithmic slop-scrolling than by locking into twitchy pattern recognition with OG shoot ’em up <em>Space Invaders</em>? But $180 is nothing to sneeze at. The Switch Lite might officially be $230 but it launched at $200 and can now often be found secondhand for just $100.</p> <p>Retro consoles are cashing in on nostalgia more than anything, but the Atari Gamestation Go is still coming in pretty steep. The NES and SNES Classic came in at $60 and $80 respectively when Nintendo launched them years back. The PlayStation Classic was still only $100. North of that and thoughts of childhood <em>Pitfall</em> sessions brush up again the harsh realities of the current family budget. At least the Atari Gamestation Go doubles as a visual showpiece and a portable time machine.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-first-boss-bell-beast-guide-2000624015</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-let-hollow-knight-silksong%E2%80%98s-first-boss-stop-you-from-playing.1291560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are ways in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> can be a bit more difficult than its predecessor. For players new to the Metroidvania Soulslike series, it can feel a bit like taking a plunge in a cold lake: bracing but unpleasant. The game’s first boss fight is against the Bell Beast. If you’re feeling a bit daunted at first, the good news is that the giant arthropod is easy to defeat once you’ve got the pattern down.</p> <h2>Where do I find <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss?</h2> <p>The Bell Beast is located early in the game in The Marrow. You can’t get to him until you unlock the Silk Spear ability next door in Mosshome. After getting it, there’s a silk obstacle in The Marrow you can cut through to unlock the way to the Bell Beast’s layer.</p>  <p>Glad you asked? While many <em>Silksong</em> players probably won’t have much trouble with this guy, this is a judgement-free zone with the sole goal of trying to help as many <em>Hollow Knight</em> players break through that first barrier and be able to continue their journey to the Citadel.</p>

 <p>The Bell Beast has two phases and four attacks. In the first phase he’ll just appear from underground and run across the screen or jump over your head. If he’s running across, you can jump over him and hit him 2-3 times from the back before he burrows back under. If he’s about to jump over you, just stand in the middle of the screen underneath the peak of the arc and hit him in the back again.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624024"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624024">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second phase is where things get slightly trickier. First, he’ll come up from the ground and spawn two bells that roll across opposite sides of the screen. These are easy to enough to jump over and get a few hits in. Later, he’ll start shaking the whole cavern and have bells drop from the ceiling that bounce while he’s rotating through his other three attacks. Sometimes these bells bounce toward you. Sometimes they bounce away.</p>

 <p>If you stand close to where they drop, they’ll miss you completely no matter which direction they’re going. Plus they disappear before the second bounce. But watch out because during this phase he’ll also spawn bells each time he comes out of the ground.</p> <h2>He keeps killing me in three hits!</h2> <p>Brutal, right? Even though he’s <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss, Bell Beast, like everything else in the game, hits pretty hard. That leaves little time to memorize his attack pattern and not much room for error once you do. The biggest general tip for the boss fight, like lots of encounters in <em>Silksong</em>, is just to stay calm. Don’t move around more than you have to and don’t overreact to flashy attacks.</p> <p>Imagine instead of a giant, harrowing roly-poly bug constantly trying to squash you, he’s just a rectangle-shaped hit box moving around the screen in very predictable ways. Save at a bench nearby, hit enough enemies to have a full roll of silk to bind with/heal yourself at the start of the fight, and then stick to dodging each of the four attacks as they come. You’ll get to the end of the fight thinking, “How is he still alive?” but then after a few more hits he’ll be liberated and become your new best friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> is a tough game. Its bosses hit hard, your early arsenal of abilities can feel quite limiting in combat encounters, and its volatile level design can send you accidentally tumbling down into a chasm and losing an hour of progress. But while these kinds of challenges were arguably all to be expected from a sequel to the challenging original, there’s one brand of platforming segment whose sheer difficulty is catching players off guard, especially if they miss an optional upgrade early on in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Hornet, the needle-wielding hero of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-long-completionist-achievement-2000623157"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a><span>, starts off the game with a downward diagonal aerial strike that is used as both an anti-air attack as well as a platforming tool in sections where she must basically bounce on pods to get some verticality and reach higher areas of the map, using her needle as a pogo stick. By default, this attack has a diagonal slant that makes it difficult to precisely strike these pods and position yourself in an optimal way to reach the next one. Though there’s an available, optional upgrade that can make traversing this section much easier, many players miss it,, and because getting through these sections without it is hard but not impossible to pull off, a lot of fans think these are simply mandatory skill checks for your timing and positioning, and are uploading clips of themselves trying, failing, and crashing out.</span></p>       <p><span>The thing is, these sections don’t have to be </span><i><span>as </span></i><span>hard as some folks have been making them out to be, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s non-linear nature</span></a><span> means not everyone is finding the upgrade that makes them significantly easier. Crests are equippable items you’ll find throughout </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>that allow you to swap between different builds, and the Crest of the Wanderer swaps out Hornet’s diagonal air attack for a standard downward strike similar to the one the Knight can perform in the original </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, allowing you to more easily and precisely pogo your way through these sections. Getting them isn’t an easy task, however, as you’ll have to unlock a few areas, abilities, and items to do so. Here’s </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>rundown of how to find the Crest of the Wanderer:</span></p>  <p><span>Keep in mind that this will also cut down the range on Hornet’s attacks, so you’ll have to get in closer in combat. Switching out crests is all about give and take, so it’s up to you to decide which perks and drawbacks are worth it to you. But if you, like many others, are tired of falling into lava and spike pits while you’re trying to pogo on these pods, now you know there is a better way.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate’s 5TB Xbox Game Drive Costs Less Than the 4TB, Like Getting 1TB Free (3-Year Rescue Included)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-5tb-xbox-game-drive-costs-less-than-the-4tb-like-getting-1tb-free-3-year-rescue-included-2000623483</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-5tb-xbox-game-drive-costs-less-than-the-4tb-like-getting-1tb-free-3-year-rescue-included.1291506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game file sizes just keep growing bigger and bigger, but consoles struggle to keep up. Just look at the Xbox Series X|S. The more robust Series X has an internal SSD with storage totaling 1TB. With the Series S, you get about half that at 512GB. Not all of that is usable storage though as much of it is holding the system software needed for your Xbox to work in the first place. Then we have games come out like last year’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> with a file size in the triple digits. If you play more than three or four games, you’re going to be in a constant struggle of deleting and redownloading software as you bounce between games.</p>
<p>Luckily, their are external options. <strong>The Seagate Game Drive for Xbox comes with a crazy 5TB of storage</strong> to put all of your file size worries to bed.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/"> It normally goes for $150, but right now it’s 13% off which brings the price down to just $130.</a> You’ll save a good $20 (which just so happens to be exactly enough to hop into&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Gaming Ahead</h2>
<p>Ok so here’s the catch. This is an HDD, not an SSD. Hard disk drives are notably slower than solid state drives. So much so that the Seagate game drive is incapable of playing Xbox Series X|S games directly from it. You’ll have to move the game file from the HDD to your Xbox’s internal storage in order to play it—sort of the digital version of taking your game disc off the shelf and popping it into the console.</p>
<p>Transferring the files can be much faster than redownloading from Microsoft’s servers otherwise would be, especially if you live in an area with unreliable bandwidth.</p>



<p>The good news is that if you’re still playing a bunch of Xbox One, Xbox 360, or original Xbox titles, they can be loaded and played directly from the drive. The drive is also compatible with Xbox One and Xbox 360 directly if tho9se consoles still get regular action in your place.</p>
<p>The HDD is portable as well. You can have your games loaded onto it, then take it over to a friend’s house. Pop it into their Xbox and you’ll be able to load up or move over your games onto their console. The drive is simple plug and play making it pretty straight forward to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/">Right now, you can save $20 on the Seagate Game Drive for Xbox for a limited time. Get it for just $130.</a></p>
