              <p>Late last month, an old video showing off what a hypothetical AAA<em> Mario</em> game would look like went viral after two voice actors added new dialogue styled after that in blockbuster games like <em>Uncharted</em> and <em>Gears of War.</em> Now, a few weeks later, one line from the game, “Focus, M,” has spread across all corners of the web, annoying some and leading to a lot of online discourse.</p> <p>On December 23, voice actor Ryan Stewart uploaded a video featuring himself as Mario and another voice actor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arielhckva/?utm_source=ig_embed">Ariel Hack</a>, as Peach, talking to each other over comms as the famous plumber approaches Bowser’s castle. The original gameplay video featured in Stewart’s post was created by Funkyzeit as a conceptual mock-up of what a AAA Mario game might look like, and was shared online back in 2022. This new version, featuring dialogue perfectly parodying how some AAA games deliver narrative and tutorial information, quickly went viral online, with Stewart’s Twitter upload reaching over 25 million views as of January 5.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had no idea AAA Mario would be so popular. I had to make some more. 🍄<br>ft. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielHck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ArielHck</a> as Peach <a href="https://t.co/p3YMlF5rEn">https://t.co/p3YMlF5rEn</a> <a href="https://t.co/ggarxptMuZ">pic.twitter.com/ggarxptMuZ</a></p> <p>— Ryan Stewart (@RyanStewartVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanStewartVO/status/2002854369369452879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Quickly, one phrase from the video became popular: “Focus, M.” This line is delivered by Hack’s Peach after Mario makes a joke. It’s a pitch-perfect replication of the kind of AAA video game dialogue that was so prevalent in blockbuster single-player games from the Xbox 360 and PS4 generations, and which can still be found in some bigger games now. All of this dialogue, including the “Focus, M” line, was written by Stewart himself, who told <em>Kotaku</em> that while he didn’t expect the bit to go as viral as it has, he knew he had a “banger” on his hands once he heard it.</p>

 <p>“As I was writing the dialogue, I knew it was funny,” said Stewart via email. “Once I got Ariel’s reads in, though, I knew it would be a banger. That being said, the sheer amount of discussion it spawned after the fact was unexpected.”</p>

 <p>When asked for his thoughts on how “Focus, M” has become its own meme, with people using it who haven’t even seen the original video, Stewart told <em>Kotaku</em>:&nbsp; “If nothing else, I think it’s resulted in some excellent fan art! I hope my future posts can do the same.”</p>

 <p>While Stewart is pretty positive about “Focus, M,” some online aren’t. The original creator behind the AAA Mario video never replied to <em>Kotaku’s</em> request for comment, <a href="https://x.com/KingOfSuper/status/2004602334975001002">but did like a YouTube comment left by someone comparing them to Oppenheimer</a>, the man who created the nuclear bomb. That seems to indicate that, at the very least, Funkyzeit has mixed feelings about their involvement in “Focus, M.”</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, online, the “Focus, M” meme has rapidly evolved and spread. You can find people applying it to basically anything at this point. <a href="https://x.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199">New <em>Marathon</em> graphics?</a> That’s a “Focus, M” game. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xenobladeus.bsky.social/post/3maxn33scsk2x">PS1 platformer <em>Croc?</em></a> That’s a “Focus, M” game. <a href="https://x.com/freakofxeets/status/2004670291704942597"><em>Starfield</em>?</a> Sure, whatever, that’s a “Focus, M” game, too.</p>

 <p>At this point, the meme has already run its course and lost all meaning. It’s like people calling anything they don’t like slop. And you can find plenty of posts from people saying they feel the meme is dead already. I’m not so sure, though. I still regularly see people tagging new AAA games and remasters as “Focus, M” games. And I suspect that at least a few devs have been watching all of this and are possibly making some tweaks to dialogue in their own upcoming games. I feel certain that at least one game has likely removed or cut a line that asked the player to “Focus…” in response to all of this.</p>

              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ series finale continues to be a lightning rod for controversy. While plenty of people were fine with how the Netflix horror series wrapped up after a decade, there’s a loud subset of fans who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking to the digital streets</span></a><span> to tear it down, say awful things about the people who worked on it, and declare it the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>next </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>-level failure</span></a><span>. Another fraction of that group, however, is holding onto a bizarre sliver of hope with the belief that perhaps the disappointing conclusion is not all it seems. The movement, which is calling itself Conformity Gate, has gathered “evidence” indicating that the events depicted in the finale are actually an illusion and that there is still a battle left to fight, which will play out in a secret episode that’s not available on Netflix right now.</span></p>  <p><span>Obviously, we’ll be discussing the fifth season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> here, so if you want to stay spoiler free, you should leave now. (Really, you probably shouldn’t have opened this article to begin with.) But the tl;dr of the theory is that the sterile and rushed nature of the finale is an intentional creative choice meant to reflect that it takes place in a distorted reality created by Vecna and everyone in the show is “conforming” to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Admittedly, I fully planned to just roll my eyes at all this pretty wild speculation because I lived through the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>ending controversy and the Indoctrination Theory, which fans believed explained that game’s finale as a hallucination but was really just a way for them to cope with not liking the way things turned out. But, I don’t know, there’s </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>compelling evidence in the theory, both based on what’s in the show and on how Netflix and show creators the Duffer Brothers have talked about it since.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many of these details are subtle, such as the way that characters sit during the graduation scene resembling how villain Vecna sits at other points in the series, whereas others seem to be pretty overt, like Max calling out Mike’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>epilogue for being too comforting, as if something is off. Here’s one of the quicker rundowns I could find, by @meechski on TikTok, but you can also find </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAQbdjjaJk&amp;pp=ygUfY29uZm9ybWl0eSBnYXRlIHN0cmFuZ2VyIHRoaW5ncw%3D%3D"><span>much lengthier breakdowns on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>Also, as someone in the comments of that video points out, if you search “conformity gate” or “fake ending” on Netflix, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is the only search result for the latter, and one of two for the former alongside </span><i><span>Emily in Paris</span></i><span>. Make of that what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t know that any one thing made me a full-blown believer, but taken all together, it was enough for me to at least become interested in seeing if it actually pans out. Conspiracy theories usually have at least </span><i><span>some</span></i><span> shred of plausibility that allows them to gain some traction, but they also tend to be made up of a lot of square pegs shoved into round holes. All these pieces of evidence could just be coincidences born of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>bad writing</span></a><span> and desperation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">guys… notice how all of them are reading WHITE scripts when shawn levy confirmed the finale was printed on RED scripts… they are trying to confuse us with that trailer. i AM sure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/confirmitygate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#confirmitygate</a> <a href="https://t.co/Pje0LF13dm">pic.twitter.com/Pje0LF13dm</a></p> <p>— ʅǝɯ | ੈ✩‧₊˚ (@melinastapes) <a href="https://twitter.com/melinastapes/status/2008186236830421086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Luckily, we won’t really have to wait long for these hopes to be shattered, as the entire theory hinges on this hypothetical secret finale premiering on January 7, when Netflix is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfaW74zJlmk"><span>planning to announce something about its 2026 programming</span></a><span>. Of course, I don’t want any </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans to have to suffer a worse ending than the one they’d hoped for, but after witnessing the behavior of some members of the community in the wake of a disappointing finale, I’m also wondering if those who have said some truly heinous things about the people who worked on this show even deserve a better ending.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hypixel Studios, developer of the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired survival game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, has shown the sandbox game’s modding capabilities with a </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors-</span></i><span>like prototype that has fans excited ahead of the game’s Early Access launch later this month. In a </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658"><span>social media post</span></a><span> over the weekend, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared a 40-second gameplay clip showcasing a character fending off voxel-based hordes of enemies in a top-down view arena.</span></p> <p><span>According to Collins-Laflamme, the video shows a </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> mod created by a team member in their spare time, and it’s intended as a proof-of-concept demo for “how different genres” could be realized within the game by fans and modders.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The following video showcases a server-side Hytale mod created by a Hytale team member in their spare time. It’s intended purely as inspiration for how different genres could be realized within Hytale! </p> <p>The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding… <a href="https://t.co/YaszQv9kDb">pic.twitter.com/YaszQv9kDb</a></p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding capabilities and was used to build a simple, survivor-like experience,” Collins-Laflamme wrote. While the mod is not planned for release as part of the game, Hypixel “may publish it – or similar examples – as reference material for the community.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The video comes less than two months after Hypixel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-hypixel-riot-canceled-revived-gameplay-minecraft-2000645466"><span>reacquired the rights</span></a><span> to</span><i><span> Hytale </span></i><span>from </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> maker Riot Games, which had previously canceled the project in June of last year. The team released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-price-low-minecraft-hypixel-2000646230"><span>16-minute gameplay trailer shortly afterwards</span></a><span>, but the latest clip is focused on </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> potential to be a springboard for user-generated content like the Mojang hit that inspired it.</span></p>

 <h2>Hytale is gearing up for Early Access</h2> <p><span>“My prediction is, it will do very well initially and then it will slow down until the modders / servers and us start to release some major content and then it will keep growing for years to come. Especially as we add more modding tools and options,” Collins-Laflamme </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006936928026026273"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span>, responding to a user who suggested that </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> release “will probably be something huge.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The reply came from a larger thread in which the co-founder expressed feeling “anger” as the studio gets closer to the early access launch of this new version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which is slated for January 13. According to Collins-Laflamme, that’s due to pouring four years of engineering into rebuilding the game’s engine rather than working on gameplay features. In his eyes, that leaves the team with a “four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do,” alongside a rebuilt engine that is “never gonna be used.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As previously </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq"><span>stated by the developer in a FAQ</span></a><span>, the sandbox won’t be available on Steam at launch in order to focus on its existing community. That’s to avoid chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.” Hypixel explained that while it doesn’t shy away from “honest, negative criticism,” the team is more interested in feedback from players who are already familiar with the game’s development background.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most importantly, the FAQ notes that Steam “currently doesn’t support” some of </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> modding features, and that the developer “will be in contact with Valve in the near future” to try and fix that. Otherwise it might be a while before Steam users get to recreate the platform’s latest hits inside</span><i><span> Hytale</span></i><span>. </span></p>
