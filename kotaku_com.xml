              <p><i><span>Pathways</span></i><span>, a “bespoke interactive learning” game developed in collaboration with the “political literacy” platform Shout Out UK and funded by the British government, has inadvertently spawned a “cute goth e-girl” meme. The game was meant to fight anti-immigrant extremism, but now its character has been turned into a pro-right-wing symbol.</span></p> <p><span>Developed by the Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire council in collaboration with Shout Out UK, </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is a barebones visual novel web game that puts you in the shoes of Charlie, a college-aged boy or girl who has a terrible habit of running into bizarre political radicalization scenarios. It’s </span><a href="https://www.shoutoutuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pathways-teachers-guide-extremism-youth-radicalisation.pdf"><span>being touted</span></a><span> as a tool that teachers can use to combat the “promotion or advancement of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The "worst" ending btw <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Amelia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Amelia</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pathways?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pathways</a> <a href="https://t.co/v7kZ3N9oMi">pic.twitter.com/v7kZ3N9oMi</a></p> <p>— Bee CrayZee (@Bee_CrayZee) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bee_CrayZee/status/2010603633826750834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The level-headed critique of </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is that its content and choices are sparse. The idea that a minute-long PowerPoint slideshow-style narrative could fully address extremism and radicalization is laughable, but the railroaded, overly domineering choices will doubtlessly also come off as ham-fisted to the same people it’s meant to reach.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, it’s the online right that’s propelled </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/amelia-pathways/"><span>into memedom</span></a><span>. The result has been the sudden influx of AI-generated “cute goth e-girl” fan-art (if you can call it “art”) in some corners of the internet, based on Amelia, </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>racist, yet alternatively-styled, antagonist.</span></p>

   <p><span>She’s exploded in popularity on alt-right leaning subreddits like r/Asmongold, who immediately saw a vision of </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/1qff3jv/authright_be_like/"><span>their perfect woman</span></a><span> in Amelia. As a result, the meme spread to X. Since then, users have been making </span><a href="https://searchlightmagazine.com/2026/01/how-purple-haired-cartoon-amelia-became-a-far-right-icon/"><span>Grok work overtime</span></a><span>, generating hundreds of Amelia images for the platform’s far-right crowd to enjoy.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the blame here lies with whoever designed </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>artwork. Making a goth-adjacent female racist be the only character in your game with a distinctive design, and then having them become more attached to the protagonist if they choose to support anti-immigration ideas and policies, was certainly a choice. I can’t help but feel that whoever designed Amelia has clearly never met a teenager before. That being said, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1qfhs8y/british_government_isnt_even_trying_bro/"><span>Reze/Amelia meme</span></a><span> on the r/Chainsawfolk subreddit is very, very funny.</span></p>

              <p><span>The difference between having to use one launcher or another to boot up a PC game might feel like a trivial thing to some, but a game launching only on something like the Epic Games Store as opposed to the more ubiquitous Steam can affect its reach. Tim Sweeney, Epic CEO and guy who posts too much for as much money as he has, seemed to forget this as he preached the virtues of capitalism and competition, saying that developers and gamers alike win when they have options.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Epic and Steam compete for each customer and each sale. On some transactions, Epic wins. On more, Steam wins. But one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals. <a href="https://t.co/RzU0twrmbr">https://t.co/RzU0twrmbr</a></p> <p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717881431769340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Michael Douse, Larian Studios’ publishing director, </span><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329?s=20"><span>responded</span></a><span> to Sweeney’s comments by stating that some of Epic’s publishing deals had seemed antithetical to Sweeney’s seeming belief in the value of “options” for developers and players. He specifically calledout the fact that </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2</span></i><span>, Remedy Entertainment’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2023-totk-baldurs-gate-3-alan-wake-2-1851109182"><span>award-winning horror sequel</span></a><span>, is only available on the Epic Games Store, rather than Steam. Remedy has said in recent financial reports that it has been </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-arent-satisfied-with-our-recent-financial-performance-remedy-says-it-will-return-to-profitability-by-delivering-hits-again/"><span>operating at a significant loss</span></a><span> in recent years, primarily due to its co-op shooter </span><i><span>FBC Firebreak</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/morning-checkpoint-fbc-remedy-ceo-mortal-kombat-star-wars-2000638199"><span>flopping last year</span></a><span>, but in general, the studio seems to be dealing with financial troubles. Douse argues that the company is losing out on “potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue” by sequestering </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2</span></i><span> on a less popular storefront.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Not that they need the money but a [percentage] take to Epic could’ve recouped dev costs [and] more,” Douse wrote. “Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don’t see the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> brand attempting to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Realistically I think if you want to be consistent in dev positive messaging you just take an easy PR W by amending the contract to allow them to drop the game on Steam now everyone has made their money and the drop-off in UA has made that angle negligible <a href="https://t.co/v5rAo6XUR3">https://t.co/v5rAo6XUR3</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2014033787378635220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, there is some evidence that suggests </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></i><span>might finally be making its way to Steam after almost three years. Just earlier this week, an </span><i><span>Alan Wake</span></i><span> “franchise” Steam bundle including the original game and the </span><i><span>American Nightmare </span></i><span>spin-off was </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/15407/"><span>renamed “Origins,”</span></a><span> implying that this collection of the early games may no longer encompass the entirety of the “franchise” as it exists on Steam. If so, maybe Remedy will get a nice bump in </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></i><span>sales, but it is important to point out that for all Sweeney’s touting competition and options as something we should all support, if the deals studios have to make to work with Epic leave studios at a disadvantage with potentially catastrophic consequences, it’s all just posturing.</span></p>

 <p><strong><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: 1/22/26, 12:03 p.m. ET: </b></strong>Remedy has weighed in on the situation <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630">with a statement of its own</a>, saying that while yes, there are some publishing deals that don’t work in a developer’s favor, the one it agreed to with Epic was “fair” to the studio.</p> <blockquote><p>Hi. There would be no <em>Alan Wake 2</em> without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</p></blockquote>

              <p>It’s not uncommon for workstations and gaming setups to get cluttered fast. Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and managing each of them can be a hassle. If you’re looking to reduce the cable mess on your desk and want something that can power/charge all your essentials at once, we recommend checking the 14-port Anker Prime docking station out, especially at its current price.</p>
<p>This 14-in-1 solution is great for charging, transferring data, and even managing dual displays. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">It normally retails for a not-so-friendly price of $270, but you can grab it today for just $170 at Amazon. That’s after a massive 37% limited time discount</a>. It’s a straightforward offer, meaning you don’t have to worry about using any coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Delivery is free too, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Manage All Your Essentials In a Single Place</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 ports in total, which lets you manage a ton of gadgets simultaneously. At the front, you’ll find USB-C and USB-A for fast data transfers and charging, plus an audio jack for headphones or earbuds. The back features HDMI ports for a multi-monitor setup, as well as an Ethernet port, additional USB-A ports, and a USB-C upstream connection for your laptop.</p>
<p>A 160W of total output is capable of fast charging up to four devices at the same time using three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max. Moving files across will take seconds, too, thanks to speedy transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. Translation? With this at hand, you can connect all your important peripherals in one place. Think topping up your phone up as you finish a work deadline, plus offloading heavy files from your PC to a secondary storage device in just a couple of minutes.</p>



<p>Those who prefer a larger, more productive setup will appreciate how the dual HDMI ports offer crystal-clear streaming or mirroring across two displays at up to 2K@60Hz with a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 laptop. With Windows, you can use the setup to keep meetings on the secondary display while working on the main one, or even use a third display for reference material. It works a bit differently on macOS, however, as both external displays will mirror the same content.</p>
<p>Compatibility-wise, the dock supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections, plus plays nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. What’s even better is that it comes with an efficient airflow system, and the ActiveShield technology monitors the temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to maintain optimal performance, even when things get a bit intense. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating and negatively impacting the connected devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box is the 14-in-1 Anker dock itself, a USB-C cable for the upstream port (3.3 ft, 100W, 10Gbps), and a safety sheet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">The dock is now available for just $170 at Amazon, down from $270. It’s not every day you get to save a nice $100 on an efficient solution such as this one</a>. Additionally, the offer is likely going to expire soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>
