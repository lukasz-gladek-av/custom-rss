              <p data-start="0" data-end="304">Music truly comes to life when you experience it with a high-quality pair of headphones. One of the best in the market today is Sony’s flagship noise-canceling model, the WH-1000XM5. Known for their exceptional sound and comfort, these headphones offer a premium listening experience that’s hard to match. Currently, they’re available at a great price as one of Amazon’s early Black Friday deals, with discount of $62 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">Normally priced at $460, the platinum silver, black, and midnight blue versions are now reduced by 13%, bringing them down to just $398.</a></p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">I must applaud Sony on what they’ve done here. When we look at the naming schemes for Sony’s competitors in the space, we find products like the Apple AirPods Max or the Samsung Galaxy Buds. These catchy, memorable names tie in neatly with their companies’ broader product lineups.</p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">Then we have Sony. This brand decided to go with the WH-1000XM6. This assortment of letters and numbers give little indication they represent a pair noise-cancelling wireless headphones aside from the WH. This is less a product name and more an internal SKU number, and I find that just beautiful. These headphones don’t need some flashy name. The headphones speak for themselves.</p>

<h2 data-start="685" data-end="1266">Cancel Out the World Around You</h2>
<p data-start="1268" data-end="1700">A standout feature of the WH-1000XM6 is their exceptional noise-canceling capabilities. Sony has designed these headphones with advanced processors and twelve microphones that work together to detect and counteract external sounds. This advanced noise-canceling technology creates a completely immersive listening experience, allowing you to enjoy your music, podcast, or audiobook without the distractions of the outside world.</p>
<p data-start="1702" data-end="2038">The noise cancellation is especially noticeable (or maybe unnoticeable?) during phone calls. Thanks to the built-in microphones, your voice is isolated and amplified—even in noisy environments. Whether you’re in a crowded café or a busy office, the person on the other end of the call will hear you clearly, with no background noise to disrupt the conversation.</p>


<p data-start="2040" data-end="2685">In terms of comfort, the WH-1000XM6 excels. The headphones are wrapped in soft, synthetic leather, making them feel plush and comfortable against your ears, even during extended listening sessions. They’re lightweight too, which means you can wear them for hours without feeling fatigued. In fact, with an impressive 30-hour battery life, you can listen to music or take calls throughout the day without worrying about recharging. And if you do forget to charge them, don’t stress. A quick three-minute charge will give you an additional three hours of playback—enough to get you through the rest of your commute or the next leg of your journey.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="3100" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a music lover, a podcast enthusiast, or someone who just wants to enjoy a quiet moment in a noisy world, these headphones are an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">With the current discounts of $62 off, there’s no better time to grab a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and experience their next-level audio quality.</a></p>
