              <p>My New Year’s resolution list for 2026 is almost ready, and spending mindfully, aka not overspending, is at the top. It’s going to be a tough one, since I basically hunt deals for a living. If you’re planning to save on everyday groceries, prescriptions, gas, etc, you might want to consider grabbing a 1-year Sam’s Club membership, which gets you access to all these and more at a discounted rate.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/"> A year-long Club membership is usually sold for $50 at StackSocial, but the retailer just took 60% off it, letting you grab it for just $20.</a></p>
<p>The Plus membership (with a bit more perks) is discounted, too. It’s going for $60, down from $110 after a nice 45% off. These are selling fast, and they expire soon. We share how to grab one, plus all the benefits these memberships offer, below.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Save Big On Groceries, Gas, and Medicines</h2>
<p>Before we get into the specifics of each subscription, here’s a bit about how it’s going to work; completing your purchase on StackSocial gets you an instant promotion code via email, which you can use while signing up for the Sam’s Club membership. The code is non-transferable, and it renews automatically every year until you cancel. The membership offer is only available to new Sam’s Club members in the USA, and is valid at over 597 U.S. Sam’s Club locations. You need to redeem your code on or before December 31, 2025, as it expires after that. This digital membership card can be accessed using the Sam’s Club app on your smartphone or even a desktop. There’s a one-person limit per subscription, but you can purchase an additional membership as a gift for a loved one.</p>
<p>Club members get to enjoy wholesale pricing, member-only gas prices, and instant savings on already-discounted items. Over 600 generic prescriptions start at just $14, plus you can enjoy walk-in vaccinations at Pharmacy locations. The Scan &amp; Go option lets you scan items using the dedicated app as you shop, allowing you to skip long checkout lines at the store. Additionally, picking up pre-packaged items is free! You will also save on travel, entertainment, personalized printing, and automotive services all year-round.</p>



<p>Plus members get free delivery on all eligible orders of $50 or more, early access to deals, and free delivery on eligible prescriptions. They will also earn 2% back on qualifying in-club purchases.</p>
<p>Basically, these memberships pay for themselves in the long run by helping you save a ton on a wide range of items and even experiences. The Club membership is going at a $30 discount, while the Plus option can be yours for $50 less. Occasional shoppers looking to save should grab the former, but if you’re a frequent shopper who regularly uses pharmacy services and wants free shipping, Plus is likely going to be a better option for you. Note that at the time of writing, over 20,000 discounted subscriptions have been sold. It’s a popular pick, but it expires soon. It’s best to snap it up while there’s still some time left.</p>
<p>That said, StackSocial is offering plenty of other subscriptions for less at the moment. Now is also a great time to grab magazine subscriptions, a lifetime Microsoft Office license, and more without paying the full price.</p>

              <p><span>The second season of Amazon Prime’s </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>series debuts later today, but reviews for the post-apocalyptic atom-punk show are pouring in now—and the vibes seem mostly positive, aside from concerns over the story expanding in too many different directions.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Picking up exactly where season one left off (with Ella Purnell’s Lucy and Walton Goggins’ </span><span>Ghoul setting off in pursuit of Lucy’s evil dad), </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>’s second season takes us to what many players believe is the setting of the best game in the franchise: New Vegas. Goggins’ world-weary and cynical Ghoul and Purnell’s wide-eyed and naive Lucy are a match made in Western heaven, and it seems that their dynamic still feels fresh in this new season—though critics only got to see six out of the eight episodes in season two.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whereas season one spent a lot of time setting the scene and building the audience’s connections to the lead characters (who also include Aaron Moten’s Maximus, a rookie soldier in the Brotherhood of Steel), </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>’s latest installment focuses on the apocalyptic wastelands’ competing factions and their leaders. Much like in the games, their conflicting ideologies and consistent tensions make the wasteland even trickier to navigate, but it seems the time spent on these various factions dilutes the adventures of the three leads: Lucy, the Ghoul, and Maximus.</span></p>

 <p><span>There appear to be numerous flashbacks to the pre-apocalypse in this season, focusing on Goggins’ pre-Ghoul identity of Cooper Howard, who spies on his wife and her work with the Vault-Tec corporation. According to </span><a href="https://archive.is/20251216141105/https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video#selection-1491.235-1491.340"><span>Andrew Webster at </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><i><span>,</span></i><span> the show ensures that the cause of the nuclear wasteland is abundantly clear: greedy tech execs: “</span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> is never subtle with its social satire and that remains true here. The end of the world is brought about by a group of tech oligarchs who wield too much power, and as one character muses early on, ‘every dollar spent is a vote cast.’ Board meetings show billionaires salivating at the business opportunities that come with the apocalypse.” I wonder what Amazon’s Jeff Bezos thinks about that</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-review-episodes-1-6"><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s review,</span></a><span> Matt Purlow writes that </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two is “structured more akin to </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>,</span><span>” with “multiple other concurrent storylines that make </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> feel like the story of the wasteland itself as much as it is the tale of the key characters.” This results in a “very packed season” with “inevitable casualties,” mostly notably of which are the stories of the vault dwellers, whose silliness Purlow feels is at odds with the rest of the season’s tone.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Here’s what other reviewers had to say about </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> season two, which is currently sitting at a </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02"><span>100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes</span></a><span> with just 28 scored reviews in:</span></p> <blockquote><p>I worry that <i>Fallout</i>’s downward spiral will only continue. As <i>Westworld </i>soldiered on, the world got bigger, but the story got more generic. By the time HBO canceled <i>Westworld</i>—on a major unresolved cliffhanger!—it didn’t seem like anyone even cared where it was all headed. <i>Fallout </i>risks going down the same path. The last few episodes of season 2 might correct that course (season 3 is also already greenlit, for what it’s worth) but if not, Nolan may develop an unfortunate reputation for setting up exciting sci-fi TV shows that fail to pan out. – <strong>Jake Kleinman, </strong><strong><i>Polygon&nbsp;</i></strong></p> <p><span>Though all the storylines aren’t as compelling as the others, the series’ structure and pacing keep it moving so the audience doesn’t completely lose interest. For viewers who are well-versed in the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game universe, seeing Easter eggs around New Vegas and various factions coming to life on screen for the first time undoubtedly adds a level of interest and delight that may go over the heads of newcomers. – <strong>Aramide Tinubu,</strong></span><strong><i> Vanity Fair</i></strong></p> <p><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remains a show that glories in high contrast visuals, emotions and characters. There is no shortage of new disgusting ways for the people of this irradiated world to get maimed and die, and no shortage of new mutant creatures for Lucy, Ghoul and Maximus to have to battle, either. Both Parnell and Moten have settled comfortably into their roles, and the latter feels distinctly more natural as buttoned-up Maximus this time around. — <strong>Kelly Lawyer, </strong></span><strong><i>USA Today</i></strong></p> <p><span>Bogged down with world-building, Season 2 feels as if the Amazon Prime Video executives know they’ve got a hit on their hands and can’t help but game out a </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/craft-considerations/fallout-walton-goggins-nose-la-production-design-1235004555/"><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> universe</span></a><span> filled with spinoffs and sequels, even though they still need to develop the characters who first got viewers invested in a post-apocalyptic society that’s still controlled by corporate interests. — <strong>Ben Travers, </strong></span><strong><i>Indie Wire</i></strong></p></blockquote> <p><span>The comparisons to </span><i><span>Westworld </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span> certainly have me worried, but I’ll weigh in myself when I can watch </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two with my own eyes—you know, the same ones that <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937">actually liked the </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937"> TV series</a> (eesh).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season two episodes air every Wednesday on Prime Video, starting today, December 16.</span></p>
