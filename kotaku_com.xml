            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s video game awards season, which has now become synonymous with the annual reminder that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur:</span></i> <i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>star Ben Starr is an absolute gem. Not only is Starr once again being a total goofball for everyone else’s enjoyment, but he’s also using his voice to speak out against the industry’s inability to retain talent. Go off, anti-layoff king.</span></p> <p><span>Though he’s been an actor for a while, Starr catapulted to gamer fame after playing Clive Rosfield in 2023’s </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1732968375423209538"><span>going viral during that year’s Game Awards</span></a><span>. He then became the face of 2024’s breakout card battler </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AamFDYUaMhM"><span>doing weird advertisements as Jimbo</span></a><span>, its Joker mascot, proving once and for all that he commits to a bit. This year, he’s been nominated for several year-end awards for his role as Verso in </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, and is back on his delicious bullshit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the November 20 Golden Joystick Awards, the UK-based award ceremony that’s been around in some form since 1983, Starr walked up on-stage to present the award for Best Indie Game wearing a Golden Joystick-style </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> card with a face hole cut out that placed him at the top of the trophy. “I am classically trained Golden Joystick-winning actor Ben Starr,” he said, standing there with just his face and legs showing behind the card. “Isn’t independence empowering? You can do whatever you want.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Watch the entire presentation <a href="https://x.com/GoldenJoysticks/status/1991548621012234573">here</a>, it’s worth it.</span></p> <p><span>But Starr wasn’t satisfied with being silly. When it was announced that he’d won Best Supporting Performer for Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, he spoke about Verso as a character, about his flaws, and how they make him a polarizing figure. “I think that is what this industry does best,&nbsp; it presents us with flawed characters that reflect the lives we have on the outside,” Starr said. “‘Cause life, guys, as we know—and I’m gonna be the first one to swear—is fucking hard.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Starr also made sure to speak plainly about the video game industry’s deluge of layoffs over the last several years. “This industry is hard. We are celebrating today, astonishing video games, but there are many people who should be here who aren’t because they are laid off from the industry,” he began. (As he paused, someone in the audience shouted, “Well said, Ben.”) He continued:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Many people might criticize me for grandstanding right now, but the one thing that Sandfall do and have done is respect people that work for them. They respect the people that they are making games for, and they want to make them good. That is why this game is great, it’s because they wanted to make it good for the people they’re making it for. They didn’t want it to be popular. So they wrote characters that are flawed, they wrote characters that are broken, they wrote characters that, ultimately, you might hate. And I’m very very fortunate to potentially play one of them.</span></p></blockquote> <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> won seven </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/events-conferences/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-winners/"><span>Golden Joysticks</span></a><span> and set a record for the most nominations at this year’s Game Awards with 12. Let Ben Starr give every winning speech.</span></p>

              <p>Ho, ho, ho! Happy holidays! Everyone is getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s first DLC for free because the game needed so much post-launch fixing that Gearbox couldn’t finish the DLC in time, and will make it up to fans who paid for the pack with extra DLC next year.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched in September, it received praise for its open world, improved gunplay, and better-than-ever co-op gameplay. I really liked it! <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">But performance issues and bugs</a> on PC and console derailed some of the excitement, leading to Gearbox having to spend a lot of time fixing, improving, and updating the co-op-focused online looter shooter. In fact, according to Gearbox and 2K, the team spent so much time fixing stuff in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that it screwed up the original roadmap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1991545250532208879">On November 20, Gearbox announced</a> that <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first post-launch DLC, Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-releases-today-for-borderlandsr-4-players-for-free">will no longer be locked behind a paywall</a>. Previously, the plan was for <em>Borderlands 4</em> to get four smaller DLC drops, known as Bounty Packs, and you’d only have access to this new content if you had purchased the Deluxe Edition or Super Deluxe Edition, or had separately bought the Bounty Pack Bundle.&nbsp; However, things have changed as Gearbox was unable to include as much content as planned in the first DLC due to having to update <em>Borderlands 4</em> so much, as explained in a press release.</p>

 <p>“However, with the continued efforts to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned,” explained 2K and Gearbox. “So in the spirit of the season, and as a thank you to the community for their passion and support, 2K and Gearbox are excited to provide Bounty Pack 1…to all <em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players for free!”</p>

 <h2>What’s included in <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first DLC?</h2>  <p>In the new DLC, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <em>Borderlands 4</em> rebel leader Rush faces off against a new enemy, the miserly Minister Screw. This doofus is in charge of making sure people don’t celebrate the holidays and have fun. So across a series of new missions that make up a new questline, players will celebrate the holidays in defiance and take on Screw.</p>

 <p>Bounty Pack 1 includes a new Vault Card with fresh rewards, 24 new cosmetic items, and new weapons, too. It looks like parts of the map will become Christmas-themed, too, complete with gifts and snow. To start the new DLC, just update your game and head to any major hub in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> There you’ll find a large gift-wrapped present marked on your map, which can be interacted with to start the holiday fun.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind that Bounty Packs are smaller bits of paid content, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will also get two proper, much larger expansions as well as new playable characters next year, too</a>.</p> <p>Also arriving on Thursday <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">is a big new gameplay update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that makes a lot of changes to the looter shooter. Perhaps the most exciting is that Wildcard Missions, which make up the bulk of the FPS’s endgame content, will no longer force you to play through the entirety of missions. Previously Wildcard Missions, which are just normal missions you replay with variables, forced you to sit through all the content, even if it was all tutorial crap. Gearbox is now promising new start points to drop players into the action sooner. And that sounds like a real holiday treat that will make grinding for loot in <em>Borderlands 4</em> a lot more enjoyable and less annoying.</p>
