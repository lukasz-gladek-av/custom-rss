Like many other free-to-play games in 2025, you can play the game and earn free rewards during each season as part of the active battle pass or spend some money (or in-game currency) to unlock a premium version of the pass that offers more rewards. However, unlike in most other games, once you buy a pass in <em>Rivals </em>you’re free to unlock its rewards whenever you want. But each pass is only available for a certain amount of time and if you don’t buy it during that window, then you can’t go back later and earn missing rewards. That’s changing this week, which is nice. Less nice is that costs are going up for these old passes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As announced on May 13</a></span>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is bringing back the very first battle pass from the game’s initial “Season 0.” However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Chronovium_(Battle_Pass)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Chronovium_(Battle_Pass)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Season 0 pass back at launch only cost 490 Lattice</a></span>. When it returns on May 15 it will cost 590 Lattice. That’s a jump from about $5 to roughly $6. The old pass will only be available for two weeks and will go away again on May 29. And there will not be a free option when it returns. So if you want any of the rewards, you’ll have to pay. </p><p>NetEase says that future passes might return, though they will not be back until at least two seasons have elapsed since their debut and the passes will cost 20 percent more when they return. </p><p>The first season in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-emma-frost-invisible-woman-dagger-blondes-1851774781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-emma-frost-invisible-woman-dagger-blondes-1851774781"><em>Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>was short—just four weeks long—and happened over the holidays, so many players didn’t have a chance to get the first battle pass, which contains some great skins for Punisher, Black Panther, and Mantis. So it’s nice that its coming back and I’m happy to hear that all battle passes will seemingly be returning after a few months. But the price increase is shitty. Charging more for the same content, which is now months old, is gross and also means more players might be willing to buy a premium pass in future seasons to avoid higher costs later. Basically, <em>Rivals </em>has introduced some more FOMO despite the battle pass system actually being pretty nice. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, just to keep it real simple, Sciel uses a double-sided scythe for a melee weapon. There are actually really heartbreaking reasons for that, but in context, it does mean that despite everything else, she’s still got some powerful melee capabilities you can and should take advantage of. In particular, though, one of her bread-and-butter abilities, Sealed Fate, will depend on what element and what weapon you’ve got equipped, so more than some of the others, you still wanna choose her main weapon wisely, and not just for max Attack power.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The main reason for that is because the vast majority of her abilities cast some form of Dark energy. She and, later, Monoco are the only ones who have consistent access to Dark skills, and given how rare it is for enemies to have a defense against it, that makes her innately pretty useful. But, of course, that’s the tip of the iceberg.</p><figure id="" data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h444024"><a id="foretell"></a>Special mechanic: Foretell and Twilight</h2><p>And now, the feature presentation: Sciel’s tutorial <em>technically</em> tells players all they need to know to use the Foretell system, but it sucks at telling you how to use it effectively. And you can see why, given how easy it is for Sciel to become Death, Destroyer of Worlds with the right loadout. </p><p>So, there’s actually two special mechanics going on here. The first is Foretell. <strong>Think of Sciel’s Foretell cards like they’re little sticky bombs. You can stick a maximum of 10 onto an enemy, and whenever you’re ready, you can Consume them</strong>, which detonates some or all of them for additional damage. Obviously, you want a full payload of 10, and to hopefully not waste too many turns getting there. </p><p>The second is the Twilight mechanic. Each of Sciel’s skills is coded as either a Light or Dark skill, noted by the little sun and moon icons in the upper right of the descriptions in the menus. Using a skill generates a card with either a Sun or Moon on it. <strong>Once you’ve generated at least one Sun card and one Moon card, Sciel enters Twilight mode, which increases damage by 50%, but also doubles the amount of Foretell you can slap onto an enemy from 10 to 20</strong>. That damage increase actually goes up by 25% for every card of one type you generate before generating the opposite card to enter Twilight (i.e. adding multiple Sun cards before generating a Moon and vice versa). </p><p>It’s not a hard mechanic to grasp, but the trickiness mostly comes in the fact that the skill descriptions get very <em>Magic the Gathering</em> real fast, and especially when you’re just getting acclimated, they’re throwing a LOT at you. </p><figure id="" data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h444025"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><p>We could honestly be here all day with this one.

It’s the best go-to trigger for Twilight once you’ve got your cards stacked. It’s right next to Phantom Blade on the Skills tree, so you can grab it early on; it does a pretty absurd amount of damage for only a fourAP cost. Pair it with the Critical Burn or Critical Break Picto/Lumina, and you’ve basically taken a chainsaw to a massive chunk of every enemy’s lifebar.The main thing to remember is that it does attack using your weapon’s element, so be aware if your opponent’s immune so you don’t wind up healing your enemy for thousands of points like a dumbass. And oh yeah, if you think that Skill hurts enemies now, once you’re actually in Twilight, Sealed Fate can be an absolute wrecking ball, especially once you’ve got the enemy up to 20 Foretell. Once you’ve unlocked Gradient Attacks, drop this right after Shadow Bringer, and watch enemies melt away. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>While this is just a guide to get you started, it is worth noting just how much the game can and will change once you’ve got stuff like Fortune’s Fate in your back pocket. Also, when you’re finally brave enough to take down the colossal Sprong enemy hanging out in the southwestern part of the map, he’ll drop the Cheater Picto, allowing you to take two turns in a row, and putting that thing on Sciel makes her an absolute monster in terms of building up high Twilight percentages fast. If you go that route—and should—just make sure she has a skill that can trigger a Break, because she can get an enemy there <em>fast</em>. </p><hr><p><br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But what exactly are you paying for?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196358,195410" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the case of first-party Nintendo games, it’s pretty clear. The Mario maker already revealed new content and features coming  to the Switch 2 versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>for an extra $10, such as additional story logs, achievements, and daily stat bonuses for Link. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, meanwhile, is getting new modes and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> is effectively getting a DLC expansion, both for $20 more than the existing versions.</p><p>While making some of that stuff exclusive to the Switch 2 versions of the games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-switch-2-1851774216&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-zelda-switch-2-1851774216">is perhaps questionable</a></span>, it’s at least clear what you’re getting for paying to upgrade (or alternatively, you can access the new content for “free” with a paid Switch Online membership). In the case of third-party games, however, it’s much less obvious. <em>Hogwarts Legacy </em>owners on Switch recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-appears-to-have-a-10-upgrade-for-owners-of-the-digital-switch-version/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-appears-to-have-a-10-upgrade-for-owners-of-the-digital-switch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported seeing</a></span> an option for a $10 upgrade to the Switch 2 version in the eShop, and a similar option is already listed for <em>Civilization 7</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.harrypotter.com/news/pre-order-hogwarts-legacy-for-nintendo-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.harrypotter.com/news/pre-order-hogwarts-legacy-for-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warner Bros. Games says</a></span> the $10 upgrade pack gets players DLSS support, no load screens in the open world, faster broom flying, 1080p resolution in handheld mode, and mouse controls. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> players will need the upgrade pack to access better frame rates and mouse controls as well. The Switch 2 version of<em> Civ 7</em> follows a similar pattern, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/faq/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but also supports</a></span> increased map sizes, higher player counts in multiplayer, and GameChat (Behavior Interactive is making the new version). </p><p>While fans could just play the Switch 1 version on their new Switch 2s using backwards compatibility, neither game looks particularly good on the current hardware, providing an extra incentive to upgrade. Nintendo’s hardware developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1js5im0/the_switch_2_hardware_is_not_backwards_compatible/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1js5im0/the_switch_2_hardware_is_not_backwards_compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously said</a></span> that Switch 2 is different enough from the current console to require a layer of software emulation for backwards compatibility, but it’s hard to no in any given case just how fully-fledged the upgraded versions of games are. </p><p>Not every third-party game is going this route.<em> Sonic X Shadow: Generations</em> is $50 on Switch 2, the same as its price last fall on Switch 1. Though unfortunately <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://asia.sega.com/SonicXShadowGenerations/en/news/20250424.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicXShadowGenerations/en/news/20250424.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on its website</a></span>, Sega confirmed there’s no upgrade path at all between two versions. It also remains to be seen how indie games like <em>Hades 2</em>, which launches on both Switch 1 and Switch 2 at the same time, bridge the next-gen gap. Supergiant Games previously confirmed the action-RPG roguelike runs at  1080p on the newer hardware, but wouldn’t say if that would cost fans extra. <br></p><p>Players have been through this song-and-dance before when games jumped from $60 to $70 between PlayStation 4/Xbox One and PS5/Xbox Series X/S. Even that rollout happened more slowly, though. PS5 upgrades for Sony games were free up through <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, which the company backed down on charging for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-will-no-longer-offer-free-next-gen-upgrades-for-it-1847621301&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-will-no-longer-offer-free-next-gen-upgrades-for-it-1847621301">following online backlash</a></span>. After that, Sony at least tried to sweeten the pot with new accessibility settings and bonus “Director’s Cut” content in some cases, like Nintendo is doing now. </p><p>But plenty of third-party “next-gen” upgrades, like<em> Borderlands 3</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>have remained free like<em> Borderlands 3</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. How many game upgrades on Switch 2 will do the same? For launch at least, it doesn’t look like many. And I assume Nintendo is only just getting started with finding ways to double-dip on its back catalog with Switch 2 editions of other games like <em>Splatoon 3</em>, <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Maybe other publishers will follow suit. Who’s ready to pay $10 for a version of <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>or<em> Doom (2016)</em> without insane load times?</p><p><em>Update 5/13/2025 3:16 p.m. ET: Added information from 2K’s </em>Civ 7 <em>FAQ about Switch 2 version and </em>Sonic X Shadow: Generations<em> upgrade path. </em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
