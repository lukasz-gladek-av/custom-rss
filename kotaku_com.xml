              <p>LEGO make for wonderful gifts during the holidays. The catalog of sets LEGO offers is unthinkably vast, ranging from capturing memorable moments across our favorite media like that of Star Wars or Marvel all the way to simple sets aimed more at adults designed for display. Think those LEGO flower bouquets every slightly nerdy millennial has in their living rooms. This set here leans a little closer to the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">LEGO has a buildable cat on sale right now for 20% off. Not just any cat—a tuxedo cat.</a> This will make the perfect gift for any tuxedo cat owner this upcoming holiday. They’ll put it together and think, “it looks just like Tux!” (every tuxedo cat owner seems to name theirs Tux for some reason. Well anyway, right now this 20% discount will end up shaving $20 off the standard $100 price tag. That brings it down to just $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Holiday Gift for Cat Owners</h2>
<p>This lifelike LEGO cat model is built to actual size, standing over 12.5 inches tall and made from 1,710 pieces to bring to life its distinctive black fur and white underbelly. It makes a wonderful gift for anyone with a passion for animals, art, or design, but especially for cat owners. Particularly those who own a tuxedo cat themselves.</p>
<p>The set is interactive. The cat’s features are all adjustable so you can display yours to your liking. Rotate the head or adjust the ears, paws and tail. You can even reconfigure the cat to have it’s mouth be open or closed. And yes, when it’s open, there is a little pink piece in there so you cat can blep.</p>



<p>Even the eyes are swappable. The set comes with a pair of yellow eyes in addition to a pair of blue eyes, so you can make it match your own cat. Or go for the stunning heterochromia look with one yellow and one blue.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-marshall-acton-iii-bluetooth-speaker-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-them-out-on-black-friday%E2%80%99s-opening-day.1359196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bluetooth speaker market overflows with generic black boxes that all sound roughly the same, but <strong>Marshall brings legitimate audio heritage and iconic design</strong> to an over-crowded category. The <em>Acton III</em> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/">dropped to a record low of $179 for Black Friday’s opening day on Amazon, down from its usual $299 price</a>. Marshall built its reputation on guitar amplifiers that shaped rock and roll for decades, and that audio expertise translates directly into home speakers that sound like music instead of compressed digital mush.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small Speakers Sound Big</h2>
<p>The Acton III delivers a <strong>wider stereo soundstage compared to the previous generations</strong>, hence giving the impression of sound surpassing the physical speaker cabinet. To achieve better stereo separation in such a compact form factor, Marshall redesigned the internal driver arrangement and acoustic tuning. The signature Marshall sound <strong>emphasizes midrange clarity and controlled bass</strong> which makes vocals and instruments sound present rather than distant. You get to hear details in recordings that cheaper speakers bury under the boomy bass or shrill treble.</p>



<p>Marshall engineered the Acton III to be immediately usable without complicated setup procedures or compulsory app installations. You power on the speaker, toggle on Bluetooth on your phone, select Marshall Acton III from available devices and <strong>start playing music within 30 seconds</strong>. This straightforward approach saves you from frustration over pairing modes, connection failures, or multi-step configuration processes. This speaker remembers your previously paired device and picks up the signal automatically when it comes in range.</p>
<p>Next-generation <strong>Bluetooth 5.2 provides more stable connections with lower latency</strong> than older Bluetooth versions. The improved protocol keeps connections strong even when you walk into other rooms with your phone and reduces audio lag during video playback. Marshall future-proofed the speaker by building in support for Bluetooth features that haven’t been finalized yet, so firmware updates can enable new capabilities as the Bluetooth standard evolves.</p>



<p>The<strong> 3.5mm auxiliary input will accept wired connections</strong> from devices that don’t have Bluetooth or for situations where you want to avoid wireless compression. You can plug in older MP3 players, laptops without Bluetooth, or use the aux input for guaranteed zero-latency audio during gaming or video editing. For purists who prefer wired, analog input bypasses digital processing.</p>
<p>The <strong>top analog control knobs adjust the volume, bass, and treble</strong> with very satisfying tactile feedback-beating tapping on glass touchscreens any day. Boosting the bass for hip-hop or dialing it back down for acoustic is straightforward; you can easily dial in your preferred sound signature. The treble control brightens up vocals and cymbals or tames overly harsh recordings.</p>
<p>At $179, this Black Friday price makes the Marshall Acton III cheaper than many generic Bluetooth speakers that don’t feature the audio engineering, build quality, and design heritage that Marshall has. That 40% discount brings premium audio down to mid-tier pricing, and that wider soundstage combined with Marshall’s signature tuning delivers an experience that justifies the brand’s reputation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="90" data-end="688">Searching for a holiday gift that fits the lifestyle of the fitness lover in your life? Whether your partner prefers long runs, scaling indoor climbing walls, or sticking to a steady gym routine, the right present can show how much you pay attention to what they care about. Right now, thanks to an early Black Friday promotion, you can snag the Google Pixel Watch 4 at a solid discount. The 41mm model usually sits at about $450, but Amazon has it marked down to $350 for a short window. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">That works out to a 22% price cut, putting an extra $100 back in your pocket.</a></p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="924">The Pixel Watch 4 has a clean, polished look while maintaining the practicality people expect from an everyday wearable. You can pick between two display sizes, 41mm or a slightly larger 45mm, depending on preference or wrist size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="926" data-end="1470">The Google smartwatch can act as a personal fitness coach. It can suggest running workouts tailored to your goals, your training history, and how prepared your body is on a given day. Those personalized plans can help runners watch their progress unfold mile after mile, as longer routes and quicker splits start to feel more manageable. You can even design your own workouts, complete with warmups, cooldowns, and pace targets. Saved runs can be revisited anytime so you can track improvements and chase new personal bests.</p>
<p data-start="1472" data-end="1708">Beyond workouts, the watch provides a wide range of useful health metrics, including daily readiness scores, cardio load stats, and the FitBit Morning Brief, which gives you a quick snapshot of your recovery and helps you shape the day ahead.</p>
<p data-start="1710" data-end="1995">With the Pixel Watch 4, you can use offline Google Maps, pay on the go with Google Wallet, and connect it with other Pixel products or smart home gear such as a Google Nest hub with ease.</p>


<h2>Upgrades With the Pixel Watch 4</h2>
<p>The main upgrades we’re seeing on this newest model over the Google Pixel Watch 3 are subtle. First, while it’s hard to tell in the pictures along, the watch now features a curved display. While the Pixel Watch 3 had curved glass as well, the actual screen underneath the Watch 4 is also curved, standing out visually.</p>
<p>You can also expect better battery life with this new model getting you up to 30 hours as a standard when using the always-on display or up to 48 hours when in Batter Saver mode.</p>
<p>And to no one’s surprise, Google is now touting AI features on the Pixel Watch 4 with direct access to Gemini.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option-2000645709</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option.1359130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kicked off Black Friday by dropping the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/">Seagate 4TB external hard drive to a record low of $99, down from its usual $124 price</a>. External storage solves the constant problem of running out of space on laptops, game consoles and desktops without requiring you to open up your machine. This 4TB capacity gives you enough room to store your entire game library, backup your computer multiple times, or archive years of photos and videos. The drive’s<strong> universal compatibility with Windows, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation</strong> means you buy it once and use it everywhere without reformatting or compatibility headaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plug-and-Play Simplicity</h2>
<p>The Seagate 4TB HDD <strong>doesn’t need any software installation or setup process</strong> to get it up and running. You connect the provided 18-inch-long USB 3.0 cable between the drive and your computer, and the OS immediately recognizes it as available storage. Windows users will see the drive pop up in File Explorer; Mac users will find it in Finder; and console gamers can format it via their system settings in roughly 30 seconds. This is true <strong>plug-and-play functionality</strong> with no troublesome proprietary software, driver downloads, or cumbersome setup wizards.</p>



<p>In theory, the USB 3.0 interface can reach transfer speeds of as high as 5Gbps but realistically, <strong>this works out to 100-120MB/s for sequential file transfers</strong>. You can back up your entire photo library in the time it takes to make coffee or transfer 4K video footage without waiting around all afternoon. You will be able to copy a 50GB game in about 7-8 minutes. This speed is more than adequate for directly playing games from the drive on either an Xbox or a PlayStation, though load times will be slower compared to internal SSDs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact design measures approximately 4.5 inches long by 3 inches wide</strong> and less than an inch thick, so it easily slips into a laptop bag or backpack. Weighing only a few ounces, you hardly know the drive is in the bag when on the move. Finished in matte black to resist fingerprints, it looks professional when plugged into your laptop for home or office use. The rounded edges and smooth surfaces keep the drive from catching on contents inside a bag or scratching other devices. Seagate has engineered the enclosure to shield the internal drive against minor drops and bumps common during normal travel.</p>



<p>The 4TB of capacity offers enough space for <strong>around 1,000 hours of HD video, 80,000 high-resolution photos, or around 50 of the latest AAA games</strong>. Xbox and PlayStation users are able to install their entire game collections and not have to continuously uninstall titles to make room for new releases. Archive completed projects, store raw footage, or maintain multiple backup versions of important files without running out of space on the drive.</p>
<p>In addition, Seagate bundles the drive with one year of <em>Rescue Service</em> which will help you get your data back in case the drive dies or you accidentally delete some important files. That service alone can save you thousands of dollars compared to paying for professional data recovery out of pocket. With decades of experience in the storage business, the company’s drives power everything from consumer devices to enterprise data centers.</p>
<p>At $99, this <strong>Seagate external hard drive costs just 2.4 cents per gigabyte</strong>, which is exceptionally good value for reliable branded storage. Amazon’s Black Friday pricing brings the cost down to where buying cloud storage subscriptions for the same capacity would cost more over two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone-2000645672</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone.1359127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s stock counter shows<strong> fewer than 12 units remaining at the time of writing this article</strong> which tells you everything about how fast the Sonos Ace headphones are moving at this Black Friday price. Premium wireless headphones solve the problem of airplane noise, open office chaos and commute soundtrack quality but most flagship models cost a fortune. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Sonos Ace just dropped to its lowest price ever at $279 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $399</a>, which puts them at roughly half the cost of AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Music</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sonos Ace delivers spatial audio via Dolby Atmos</strong> which places instruments and vocals in a three-dimensional soundstage around your head. Dynamic head tracking shifts the audio positioning as you move, so the sound stays anchored to your device rather than rotating with your head. This tech creates an immersive listen that’s almost as if you’re sitting in a recording studio or a concert hall. It works great in those Atmos-mixed tracks on Apple Music or Tidal, where producers have placed elements on purpose in the spatial field.</p>



<p>It’s unusual that Sonos allows for <strong>lossless audio streaming over Bluetooth</strong>; most wireless headphones tend to compress audio to fit within Bluetooth’s bandwidth limitations. The company also uses USB-C connectivity for true lossless playback when you want absolute audio fidelity. This dual approach means you get convenience when you need it and maximum quality when you’re sitting down for critical listening.</p>
<p>The <strong>ANC uses multiple microphones to analyze and neutralize external sounds</strong> across a wide frequency range. Sonos engineered the ANC to handle everything from low-frequency airplane engine drone to mid-range conversation noise. It also adjusts in real time to your surroundings, kicking cancellation harder or softer depending on the ambient noise. Transparency mode lets you hear your surroundings when needed, be it airport announcements or quick conversations.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches 30 hours with ANC enabled</strong> which means you can fly cross-country multiple times before needing a charge. That endurance puts the Ace ahead of most competitors that struggle to hit 20 hours with noise cancellation running. The rapid charging feature gives you three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, saving you when you forgot to charge overnight. <strong>A full charge takes about three hours via USB-C</strong>&nbsp;and the headphones support charging while listening through the cable.</p>
<p>The physical design focuses on all-day comfort: <strong>plush memory foam ear cushions are wrapped in soft vegan leather</strong>. Sonos shaped the headband and earcups to adapt to various head shapes, hairstyles, and even accessories such as glasses without causing pressure points. An adjustable headband extends smoothly to find that just-right fit, while earcups rotate to keep up with the angle of your head.</p>
<p>At $279, the Sonos Ace costs roughly half what you’d pay for AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones and delivers comparable or superior features in several areas. The fact that Amazon has fewer than 12 units left at this record low price suggests other people have already figured out this value equation.</p>
