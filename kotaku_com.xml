              <p>The advantages of a laptop goes without saying, but lets say it anyway. It’s portable. It’s a portable computer you can take anywhere with you. But I’m here to tell you, “Big whoop.” a lot of us end up just doing our work from the same spot anyway and if you don’t need that portability, you can save some cash by just going with a tower instead. <strong>Take a look at Dell’s Vostro 3030 PC tower.</strong> This is the kind of computer that does what’s expected of it and nothing more. A capital P, capital C <em>PC</em>.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/"> It normally goes for $899, but Amazon happens to have it right now for 33% off. Right now, you’ll save $299, bringing the price down to just $600 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Diving into the specs, what we have here is a 13-inch by 6-inch by 12inch PC tower powered by a 14th generation Intel Core i3-14100 processor and an integrated Intel UHD 730 graphics card. It’s loaded with 32GB of RAM which while make your performance-intensive apps run fast and react snappy. As far as storage is concerned, the Dell Vostro 3030 is equipped with a PCIe SSD with a capacity of 1TB. You can expect fast load times from anything off this solid state drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compatibility Options</h2>
<p>One big bonus PC towers have over laptops—the ports. With a newer laptop you might have to suffice with just one, maybe two USB slots along the side. That’s not the case here. This Dell tower comes with three USB-A ports and one USB-C, and that’s just on the front. Turn it around and you’ll be greeted with four more USB Type-A ports. That makes eight USB ports in total.</p>



<p>Other connections you’ll find are an HDMI and DisplayPort so you can set yourself up with two monitors side by side. You also have an Ethernet port on the back and a combination headphone/microphone audio jack conveniently on the front. The Dell tower supports Bluetooth so you can pair wirelessly to headphones or other accessories like your mouse or gaming controller. Wi-Fi 6 support enables you to take advantage of fast download and upload speeds.</p>
<p>The Dell PC tower comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. That comes with support for OneDrive and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/">For a limited time, Dell’s Vostro 3030 PC tower is heavily discounted at Amazon. Get it right now for $299 off.</a> That brings the price all the way down from $899 to just $600.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969"><i><span>Light of Motiram</span></i></a><span>, Tencent’s upcoming survival game, is the subject of a lawsuit from Sony, who calls the game a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163"><span>“slavish clone”</span></a><span> of its open-world RPG franchise </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><i><span>Horizon</span></i></a><span>. Looking at the two side-by-side, the comparison is pretty damning, it utilizes both the tribal, prehistoric aesthetic of </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>, and the roaming mechanical animals that have become synonymous with Guerrilla Games’ series. Now that Sony has served papers, Tencent is arguing that the PlayStation company is trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions, and that </span><i><span>Light of Motiram</span></i><span> looks like dozens of other games, actually.</span></p> <p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/"><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i></a> <span>reports that Tencent has filed the motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that Sony is trying to use the power of the law to take a “well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it [the company’s] domain.”</span></p> <p><span>“Sony’s Complaint tellingly ignores these facts. Instead, it tries to transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets,” Tencent alleges. “By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span>—like </span><i><span>Enslaved</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry: Primal</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Far Cry: New Dawn</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Outer Wilds</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Biomutant</span></i><span>, and many more—Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions.”</span></p> <p><span>You can read more about the arguments Tencent makes in </span><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i><span>’s write-up, but the summary is that the company argues that </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>isn’t as unique as Sony claims in the lawsuit. It even points to a statement made in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tLcD1r-6w"><i><span>NoClip</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>documentary</span></a><span> by Guerrilla art director Jan-Bart Van Beek indicating that the studio had its own reservations about the game’s originality, with Van Beek saying it seemed very similar in some ways to Ninja Theory’s 2010 action game </span><i><span>Enslaved</span></i><span>. Tencent also argues that the entire lawsuit is based on hypotheticals, as the game isn’t slated to launch until 2027, and thus might not look anything like </span><i><span>Horizon</span></i><span> by the time it launches. Tencent and </span><i><span>Light of Motiram </span></i><span>developer Polaris Quest </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608"><span>scrubbed the game’s Steam page</span></a><span> of images that featured a red-haired protagonist similar to Aloy from </span><i><span>Horizon </span></i><span>last month.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-devs-difficulty-elden-ring-team-cherry-interview-2000626850</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong-devs-talk-about-why-the-game-feels-harder.1301634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> ratchets up everything from its predecessor. The world is bigger, more detailed, and more dangerous. Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen recently spoke about some of their thinking behind making the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel harder, and what players can do to navigate the higher difficulty.</p> <p>“Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight–so even the base level enemy had to be more complicated, more intelligent,” Gibson said during an interview at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ACMI Game Worlds</a> exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">according to reporting by <em>Dexerto</em></a><em>.</em> Even basic enemies in <em>Silksong</em> hit harder and can be much more aggressive. That’s because the hero Hornet is much more agile, and Team Cherry wanted to balance that out with more effective adversaries.</p> <p>“The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss,” Pellen added. “The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away.”</p>

 <h2>If you keep dying, go somewhere else</h2> <p>That was essentially what Gibson’s advice seemed to be from the interview. He argued that <em>Silksong</em> is much less controlling than its predecessor when it comes to where the player can go and explore at various points in the game.&nbsp;“The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path,” he said. “So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes.”</p> <p>The logic is reminiscent of <em>Elden Ring</em> which, despite its punishing enemies and brutal boss fights, was arguably more inviting than previous FromSoftware Soulslikes because the open world allowed players to approach each challenge in unique ways. In addition to being able to grind additional levels, they could also explore off the beaten path until they found a weapon or spell that would tip the balance of power in their favor.</p>

 <p>“<em>Silksong</em> has some moments of steep difficulty–but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you’re going and what you’re doing,” Gibson said, adding that players “have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled.”</p> <h2>A clash of design philosophies</h2> <p>There was recently a mini-debate about whether <em>Silksong</em> is actually harder than<em> Elden Ring</em>. <em>The Washington Post</em>‘s Gene Park <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/1968136044471324728">came down on the side that it is</a>. I would agree, though I think that’s in part because <em>Elden Ring</em> isn’t necessarily one of the harder games out there. <em>Elden Ring</em> is just a hard game that happened to sell over 30 million copies, meaning that its reputation is partly derived from tons of people who wouldn’t normally play a Soulslike actually giving it a try.</p>

 <p>Ryan Thompson, an assistant media studies professor at Michigan State, teased out <a href="https://x.com/BardicKnowledge/status/1968171985768460778?t=q0BLt1rfRLvioKYTgAnLMg&amp;s=19">what I thought was an interesting observation</a> about one of the core differences between<em> Silksong</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s not just that one is a 2D side-scroller and the other is a 3D open-world RPG; it’s also the way the roots of those genres diverge. “3D games are designed for you to win eventually,” he argues. “2D platformers are originally designed to take your quarter and tell you to piss off.”</p> <p>That’s an oversimplification, but a helpful one when it comes to a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em>. As the genre name denotes, it has its feet in two related but distinct traditions. One is 8-bit action platformers of the NES era that seemed to be perfectly content if the kid they were sold to was never able to beat them. The other is a baroque RPG adventure in which the expectation is you’ll be able to level up or learn your way out of any challenge.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> is as much a 2D bullet hell game as a Metroidvania, maybe even more so. The margin for error on screen is more circumscribed than in its 3D counterparts, and its arsenal is more streamlined. It’s borrowing from <em>Castlevania III: Dracula</em>‘s<em> Curse</em> more than <em>Dark Souls</em>, and the result can be more uncompromising. That might be easier to accept if <em>Silksong</em> didn’t also tell an evocative and whimsical story that’s constantly dropping devilish obstacles in your path. But I’ll take that challenge over the original <em>Mega Man</em> any day.</p>
