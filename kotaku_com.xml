            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After the destructive shitstorm that happened when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>collaborated with Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</span></a><span> in 2023, I’m surprised any esteemed establishment wants to partner with Pikachu and friends. Videos of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers pulling a Black Friday-level raid</span></a><span> on the museum’s store are still lodged in my brain, and when I heard the Natural History Museum in London was going to have a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>exhibit later this month, I started bracing myself for a repeat. It may still happen, but now that The Pokémon Company and the museum have </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-natural-history-presents-pokecology"><span>announced the card</span></a><span> they’ll be giving out at the event, some fans are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1q6bqwn/new_natural_history_museum_promo_for_the/"><span>letting out a sigh of optimistic relief</span></a><span> that scalpers might leave the whole thing alone.</span></p> <p><span>The “Pikachu at the Museum” promo card is super cute, and shows the little yellow guy excitedly walking through a museum adorned with what look like fossils of Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. At a glance, it doesn’t look like a great card for competitive play, with reasonably low stats and good but not great damage output for the amount of energy cards you’ll have to feed into it, but none of that actually matters because this card won’t be used in a deck. It’s a jumbo card, not suitable for use in a playable deck or, perhaps more notably, for placement into a collector’s binder.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657715">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is significant because jumbo cards tend to go under scalpers’ radars, specifically because they’re often harder to sell. Though its rarity may still bring in vultures, fans are hopeful this choice will take the wind out of resellers’ sails. On top of this, the card will be available at select UK retailers on January 30, so if scalpers want it that badly, they might have better luck bothering a store than a museum.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love how their scalping prevention is ‘let’s make it a jumbo, nobody cares about jumbos,’” ZVAARI wrote on Reddit. “Hope someone makes a nice normal sized reproduction of it, the art is cool and I’d like to have it in my binder.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Its both a shame it’s oversized (won’t fit in my collection nicely), but also will hopefully prevent too much hype,” PlopTheOwl wrote in the same thread. “Love the art. Would have liked it to be a full art, but honestly so pleased to see some Pokémon bones like in-game Pokémon museums.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657714">© The Pok<span>émon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>After this announcement, I’m more concerned the collab’s exclusive merchandise might be targeted by scalpers, rather than the card itself. The museum will also be selling an exclusive collection of art, stationery, clothes, collectibles, and a Pikachu plush showing him hugging a miniature museum. These will also be sold online at the UK Pokémon Center shop and the museum’s online store. If nothing else, it seems the museum and Pokémon Company are trying to avoid a second Van Gogh debacle, but we’ll see if these safeguards actually amount to anything, as scalpers still find a way to ruin anything with Pikachu’s face on it. If nothing else, I hope the fans who show up to see the exhibit are able to have a good time without being trampled by someone looking to flip the merchandise.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>x Natural History Museum event will last from January 26 to April 19.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-zenscreen-15-6-portable-monitor-quietly-drops-to-a-record-low-with-a-3-year-warranty-included-2000657284</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tired of running out of screen real estate when working on your laptop? The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) is a mobile monitor that can give your laptop or tablet the feel of a complete desktop wherever you go. It adds extra screen space for work, school and play, without having to carry a large additional display. And best of all, it can make working with multiple windows much more comfortable at home, at the office, or on the go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/">You can find the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ (viewable 15.6″) at Amazon for the low price of $119, which is a $30 savings off of the original price of $149</a>. This is an excellent opportunity to save money on this product, since it’s been discounted 20%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6687/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An additional portable monitor to give you more space</h2>
<p>This 15.6-inch viewable display is large enough to be used as a true secondary monitor. That means you can keep email, chat, or reference documentation open on one window while you are working on the primary window. For example, this would be ideal for students researching papers, professionals managing spreadsheets and taking phone calls, or anyone that likes to keep streaming video and/or social media feeds open while they work. The text appears clear, and the widescreen format works well for having multiple windows side-by-side.</p>
<p>The ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also extremely portable. The monitor is very thin and lightweight, making it easy to fit into a backpack or laptop case without being too bulky. Whether you’re traveling a lot or you just want to give yourself more room to work, game, or browse online, ou can’t do much better than this.</p>



<p>Setting up the ASUS ZenScreen 16″ is also easy. Just connect it with a single USB-C cable that provides both power and video in minutes. That means you don’t actually need any additional power bricks and cables. And who wants to figure out a place to put all of those, anyway? This results in a clean workspace and allows for easy movement between locations. Mostly, that means you might actually use it instead of tossing it in the closet.</p>
<p>Tech can be prohibitively expensive in some categories these days, and it can be hard to find deals on things you want to add to your stack. An extra monitor can be expensive, but this deal makes it relatively painless to spend.</p>
<p>This portable monitor might just change the way you get things done online. It can help, first and foremost, make your digital life seem less cluttered. Whether you’re creating graphics and placing tool palettes to the sides, keeping notes open during online classes, or monitoring chat windows while gaming, the additional screen will make a difference. All you have to do is make sure to grab it while it’s discounted.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[January Kicks Off 2026 With Some Big Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-jan-2026-amazon-prime-2000657707</link>
            <guid>1399354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Epic Games Store’s holiday giveaways are over but it’s getting 2026 started with another batch of very good freebies. That’s on top of a bunch of free games Amazon is giving away for paid Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three</em> Kingdoms</a>, normally $60, is the Epic Games Store’s first big free game of the year, which anyone can go and claim just by logging into the PC <em>Fortnite</em> launcher. The sprawling strategy game is one of the <em>Total War</em> franchise’s best and will cover you for the rest of the month and beyond if you’ve never played it before. It also won’t break your PC in terms of specs, with only a GTX 650 equivalent needed to get the game running.</p> <p>The other freebie right now is <em>Wildgate</em>, the sci-fi PvPvE multiplayer shooter from ex-Blizzard developers. The idea of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> in space with Moba elements is neat, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The player counts have gotten low on Steam, so if you want to check out what this one’s all about before it’s potentially put on ice, now’s the time. Both<em> Wildgate</em> and <em>Three Kingdoms</em> are free through January 8.</p>

 <h2>Prime Gaming free games for January 2026</h2> <p>Amazon also revealed the games that Prime subscribers can claim for free this month, starting with <em>Civilization 6</em>. Here are the rest:</p> <blockquote> <p id="available-now"><strong>Available Now</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Reflections of Life: Dark Architect Collector’s Edition</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-15"><strong>January</strong> <strong>15</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Deathkeep</em></li> <li><em>Brigador: Up-Armored Deluxe</em></li> <li><em>Gunslugs: Rogue Tactics</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-22"><strong>January 22</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em></li> <li><em>D&amp;D Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator</em></li> </ul> <p id="january-29"><strong>January 29</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>Elderborn</em></li> <li><em>Technotopia</em></li> <li><em>Al-Qadim: The Genie’s Curse</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Given<em> Civilization 7</em> still isn’t quite where fans want it to be following its launch last year, <em>Civ 6</em> is a great place to start for anyone who’s been away from the 4X series. <em>Brigador: Up-Armored Edition</em> is also an oldie but a goodie. The top-down, twin-stick shooter is like the old J<em>ungle Strike</em> games but for mechs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-watch-4-gets-a-bigger-discount-than-the-apple-watch-lte-model-is-nearly-as-cheap-as-the-wi-fi-version-2000657678</link>
            <guid>1399351</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartwatches do a lot more than just track your steps and monitor your heart rate. The best options out there are made to help you stay connected, plus on top of your health and fitness levels, right from your wrist.</p>
<p>Google makes some of the best Android smartwatches out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">Now is a great time to pick up its latest Pixel Watch 4, as Amazon has dropped it by 22%. This brings the price of this $450 watch down to just $350</a>. The offer applies to all color options, including the black case with obsidian band, the champagne case with lemongrass band, and the silver case with iris band, so there are options to choose from. Those looking for something basic yet classy should consider the black model. And if you want your watch to pop, the lemongrass band is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plethora of Health and Fitness Features</h2>
<p>The smartwatch flaunts a stunning Actua 360 domed display that’s 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3. You will be able to comfortably use it in both a sunny day and a dimly lit room without squinting. The scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass, paired with aerospace-grade aluminum housing, makes Pixel 4 more durable than ever, meaning you won’t have to constantly stress about those accidental scratches and everyday wear that’s almost inevitable. Speaking of durability, the watch is also IP68-rated, which means it can withstand most weather conditions well. Wearing it while walking in the rain or during sweaty workouts won’t affect its functionality one bit.</p>
<p>Fitness-wise, the watch offers over 40 exercise modes to let you track a range of workouts, from early morning stretches to midday cardio and late-night runs. It features custom run plans and even offers real-time guidance with advanced form tracking to help you train better. When it comes to health, Pixel 4 monitors your heart rate, plus tracks your sleep. The latter helps you understand how well you rest at night, and you can then use those insights to improve your sleep quality.</p>



<p>When connected to your phone, the watch helps you view important notifications, take calls, reply to texts, and manage music – all from your wrist. Additionally, the Satellite SOS feature lets you update your loved ones on your whereabouts, even when you’re off the grid. Gemini comes built in, so you will have a smart AI assistant to help you with stuff throughout the day. You can use it to quickly search stuff, brainstorm ideas, get reply suggestions, create schedules, and more; without picking your phone up.</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of battery life. You can extend it up to 48 hours in Battery Saver mode. That’s more than enough to go a couple of days without worrying about plugging the watch in. Even better, when you’re running low, a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 15 hours of usage. This is great for when you’re in a hurry and don’t have the time to recharge the watch fully.</p>
<p>Note that while the basic health and fitness features are available for free, advanced metrics can be accessed using Fitbit Premium. This membership offers AI-run recommendations based on your goals, deeper insights, and even access to energizing workouts by Peloton instructors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">There’s plenty more to like about the Google Pixel Watch 4. You can now grab a $100 discount, which applies to all color options</a>. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-steam-deck-docking-station-hits-its-lowest-price-compatible-with-rog-xbox-ally-legion-go-and-more-2000657269</link>
            <guid>1399312</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few years back, Valve changed the way we think about portable PC gaming with the launch of the Steam Deck. While comparisons to the Nintendo Switch were inevitable, the real game-changer was the ability to play your existing Steam library on a handheld device. That innovation sparked an entirely new category of gaming hardware: PC gaming handhelds. Being able to take full PC games on the go was something gamers could only imagine a decade ago (I’m ignoring laptops for the sake of this argument), and it’s a level of flexibility that’s hard to beat.</p>
<p>Handheld gaming is what the Steam Deck does best, but sometimes a 7.4-inch display just isn’t enough. You might want to kick back on the couch and play on a massive 65-inch TV instead. The Nintendo Switch has made this concept familiar—but can the Steam Deck do the same? With the right dock, absolutely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/">One superior option comes from UGREEN, and it’s currently available at a 33% discount</a>. Normally priced at $60, the dock is reduced by $20, bringing the cost down to just $40 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6686/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>The UGREEN docking station lets you connect your Steam Deck to an external monitor or smart TV, supporting 4K output at up to 120Hz. That level of visual performance simply isn’t possible in handheld mode, where the Steam Deck tops out at a 1280 × 800 resolution and up to 90Hz. It’s also worth noting that this dock isn’t limited to the Steam Deck—it’s compatible with other handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go and various versions of the ASUS ROG Ally.</p>
<p>The dock charges your Steam Deck via USB-C using 100W PD fast charging, ensuring your device stays powered while docked. It essentially becomes a home base for your Steam Deck, keeping it fully charged and ready to go whenever you pick it up.</p>



<p>In terms of ports, the dock includes two USB-C and two USB-A ports for wired controllers or accessories, though Bluetooth controllers work just as well. HDMI handles video output, and there’s also a built-in Ethernet port capable of speeds up to 1,000Mbps, making it suitable for stable online play or fast game downloads.</p>
<p>The thoughtful design of the UGREEN dock allows it to fold up for easy storage—ideal for travel. You can game in handheld mode on a flight, then dock the Steam Deck to a TV when you arrive at your hotel or Airbnb. The adjustable viewing angle also allows you to use the Steam Deck in a tabletop-style setup, similar to the Nintendo Switch’s Tabletop Mode, while keeping it charged.</p>

              <p>At the time of writing, just as the United States of Games Players are beginning to wake up,&nbsp;<em>ARC Raiders</em> has 159,483 people playing.&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> has 597,408. Meanwhile, the free <em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> has 556. In fairness, a few hours back, that peaked at 1,070, the best numbers it’s seen since Christmas Day. For a game that only officially (re)launched on December 4, that’s…it’s not good. It’s very, very bad. But developers 1047 Games are trying to put a positive spin on things.</p> <p>The game once known as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em> has had a self-inflicted rough time. Originally launched June last year, the sequel to 2019’s free-to-play multiplayer shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">then un-launched in July</a> in response to a cacophony of negative reaction, the game’s lack of basic features like leaderboards, and its <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-skin-bundle-prices-call-duty-maga-hat-1851784073">grim microtransaction prices</a>. None of this was helped by 1047’s CEO Ian Proulx <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-trump-hat-summer-game-fest-1851783949">wearing a MAGA-meme hat in a Summer Games Fest</a> set in the middle of LA’s disgraceful ICE raids, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">then trying to milk the impotent controversy for as long as possible</a>.</p>

 <p>After five months away, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903">the game was re-released early last month</a>, and you’d be forgiven for not having noticed. While&nbsp;<em>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</em> saw a half-decent 27,000 people show up on Steam soon after its original June 6 launch, that number had plummeted to under 2,000 by the time the game wriggled back into beta July 22. So its relaunch last month to a peak of 2,297 players on PC is <em>catastrophically</em> bad. And that was its peak, meaning the number of people simultaneously playing the game on Steam over the last month is failing to beat the worst of the tail-off from before the game was pulled.</p>

 <p>We must remember, Steam is but one of the ways people can play <em>Splitgate</em>, and doesn’t account for console numbers at all. Of course, an online, free-to-play multiplayer shooter would traditionally tend to find a good portion of its audience on PC, but we don’t have the data to show otherwise. As 1047 puts it in a brief, extremely defensive statement <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">posted to its official X account</a>, Steam numbers “show one number, on one platform, at one given moment.” Which is partially true. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">SteamDB, the source of all these PC figures</a>, show the numbers at&nbsp;<em>all</em> given moments, and maps them to a graph. Yes, they don’t show how many copies have sold, but they do tell you how many people are playing at any given point. And it’s barely any. Right now, seven times more people are playing <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4147820/charts/"><em>Your Mom</em></a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations <a href="https://t.co/ir9W0BjFHo">pic.twitter.com/ir9W0BjFHo</a></p> <p>— SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement begins with an unimpeachably true statement, however. “Steam Charts don’t measure fun.” There’s no denying this, and if the 1,000 people who are persisting with the game a month after its re-release are having a great time, then all power to them. We all know excellent games that unfairly failed to find an audience, and 1047 absolutely should be defending a game its proud of and boasting about its community. It also remains the case that when those games are based on a freemium model where income comes from players buying in-game items, then its long-term potential is somewhat limited.</p>

 <p>The statement is defiant, maintaining “The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of&nbsp;<em>Spligate</em> possible,” and thanking the players the game does have. It also implores people to give the game a try, arguing “the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion.” But what the post <em>doesn’t</em> do is provide any data for console sales to bolster the opening point that people only know how it’s performing on PC.</p>

 <p>It must be so awful, to have worked&nbsp;<em>so</em> hard on a game, and then to have had the enormous setback of a failed launch, only to re-emerge after months more effort and for no one to show up despite the game being free. I can’t even imagine. Yet, I really don’t know if putting out a statement responding to Redditors being rude about SteamDB numbers is the most professional look. Still, it’s working—we’re writing about the game as a consequence, and perhaps that’ll inspire a few more people to give the game a look. I kinda hope it works.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn the playercount is lower than your studio name. <a href="https://t.co/kgdyGxs4vu">pic.twitter.com/kgdyGxs4vu</a></p> <p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/2008628012611158306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Oof.</p>
