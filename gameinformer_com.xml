Dubbed Lego Voyagers, this take on everyone's favorite building blocks is less about building cubic dioramas and more about adventuring through a Lego world, with puzzles, platforming, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed during today's Summer Games Fest showcase, Lego Voyagers is a two-player co-op adventure where two small bricks work together to advance. Nonetheless, looks gorgeous, with a realistic visual style that matches that of Lego Builder's Journey.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Lego Voyagers reveal trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYggKzKdg08"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYggKzKdg08" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Bricks who click together, stick together," the trailer's description reads. "Lego Voyagers is a new 2-player co-op adventure that's all about building spaceships, excitement, and friendships."&nbsp;</p><p>There's no release date for Lego Voyagers, but it's set to launch in the future on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
