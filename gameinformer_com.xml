The third-person action title seems to borrow liberally from what we’ve seen in the Hitman games, but definitely has an active and fast-moving pace that establishes a unique identity.&nbsp;</p><p>From a storytelling perspective, this new installment takes us back to Bond’s earliest days in the spy service, and the tagline “Earn the number” suggests he won’t even have that familiar 007 designation as the game begins. We see a handsome younger version of Bond offering up plenty of swagger and confidence with the ladies, but the trailer also shows off some high-octane action sequences.&nbsp;</p><p>We also learned that 007: First Light is on track for a release in 2026. We don’t have full details yet on platforms, but its prior announcement appearance confirmed the game for Switch 2, and today’s appearance during State of Play confirms we’ll also see the game on PS5. We’d be surprised if the game didn’t also make an appearance on Xbox and PC, but that remains to be confirmed.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4qY9DYE184"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4qY9DYE184" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike the last two games, this one includes a split combat style, allowing you to swap between samurai and ninja styles. You can get a look for yourself with the trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The ninja style looks to be more fluid and acrobatic than the game's standard style, and in one shot, we can even see the player swap mid-battle. Stages have also expanded into open fields, which general producer Fumihiko Yasuda says will significantly increase player freedom and exploration in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer shows off lots of what we've come to expect from the series, including flashy attacks, elaborate boss designs, and a whole lot of swords. If it looks interesting, you're in luck – there's a demo for the game's alpha out today on the PlayStation store, complete with a character creator, but it will only be available until June 18, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/">according to the PS Blog</a>. Otherwise, you can play the game when it comes out early next year.</p><p dir="ltr">For more from today's State of Play, you can check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/lumines-arise-gives-the-popular-puzzler-the-tetris-effect-this-fall">the reveal of the new Lumines game from the Tetris Effect developers</a> or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/pragmata-capcoms-new-sci-fi-action-game-launches-next-year">our first look at gameplay of Pragmata</a>, Capcom's new IP.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
