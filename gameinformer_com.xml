            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/persona-4-remake-possibly-confirmed-by-voice-actor-from-original-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Given the success of Persona 3 Reload, a similar remake of Persona 4 would seem like an obvious layup, but developer Atlus and publisher Sega have not announced such a project. However, if a recent post on Bluesky by voice actor Yuri Lowenthal is anything to go by, it sounds like it's a real thing.</p><p>Lowenthal voiced Yosuke Hanamura, one of the main characters in the original Persona 4. Today on Bluesky, Lowenthal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">posted</a> the following: “And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWO_Nlfgek0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWO_Nlfgek0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It doesn’t sound like Lowenthal is just speculating either. Considering he apparently received a “no” on returning, it seems like the Persona 4 remake is happening… just without him. This is a bummer for Lowenthal and fans of the original game, but not surprising. Atlus and Sega brought on a new voice cast for last year’s Persona 3 remake, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em> has contacted Sega to ask about Lowenthal’s post and if the rumored Persona 4 remake is real. We will update this story if we learn more.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/persona_4_golden/b/playstation_vita/archive/2012/11/16/persona-4-golden-review.aspx#:~:text=Persona%204%20is%20bold%2C%20never,the%20player%20and%20the%20characters."><em>Game Informer’s</em> Persona 4 Golden review</a>, then <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-3-reload/into-the-light">check out our thoughts on Persona 3 Reload</a>.
