However, in a newsletter sent out last night, developer/composer Toby Fox explained that the game itself will launch a little earlier than the console, depending on where you live.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for purchase in Japan starting at midnight on June 5, and since Deltarune will be a launch title, the game will also go live digitally at that time. However, Deltarune is not a console exclusive – it's also launching on PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC – so tying its international release to the staggered launch of just one of its platforms doesn't make sense. Instead, the game will go live worldwide at midnight JST.</p><p>Since Japan's time zone is ahead of most of the world, Deltarune will launch on June 4 in most areas. In the US, that becomes 8 AM Pacific and 11 AM Eastern, while Europe can expect to play the game in the early evening, and Asia can expect it later that night. The exceptions to this are parts of Australia, New Zealand, and other territories east of Japan. Because their midnight will come even earlier than Japan's, meaning the Switch 2 launch happens earliest there, they'll get access to Deltarune a few hours before the rest of the world's simultaneous release.</p>

<p>On the subject of Australia and New Zealand, Fox's newsletter urges them not to spoil the game. "But, for convenience's sake, we're just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out…" the newsletter says. "Meanwhile, don't say anything about it please."</p><p>The newsletter also announced cross-generation purchasing, which applies if you buy the game on a Nintendo or PlayStation platform. For example, if you buy a PlayStation 4 version of the game, you also get a PlayStation 5 version, which is pretty standard on the platform. However, the same will go for Nintendo: if you buy the game on the Switch, you can get the Switch 2 version at no additional cost. Whether you're unsure what time your Switch 2 will arrive on launch day or you didn't get one yet, you can buy the Switch 1 version and have the upgrade ready when you get the new platform. A prior newsletter also confirmed that you can transfer save data between the two versions.</p><p>Deltarune is Toby Fox's follow-up to Undertale, one of the most successful indie games of all time. If you're interested in playing the first two chapters, they're available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC for free. The complete game, which will include four chapters and free updates for any subsequent chapters, will be $24.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/07/ex-bungie-developers-create-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>A team of developers formerly employed by Bungie has negotiated a deal to spin-off from its original company and form its own, known now as teamLFG. The news was announced in a </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"><span><span><span><span>PlayStation Blog post</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, where PlayStation CEO Herman Hulst says, "teamLFG originated at Bungie, but has also rallied developers from across the industry." The team is working on an "ambitious incubation project," though it gave few concrete details outside of that.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>While employees of the new developer </span></span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%22106699404%22%5D&amp;origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&amp;sid=KGq"><span><span><span><span>are listed publicly on LinkedIn</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, the announcement did not name anyone as founder or CEO, instead providing a statement from the studio as a whole. After stating its studio would be based in Bellevue, Washington, the statement explains that the "LFG" in the studio's name stands for "looking for group," a common internet acronym for people searching for people to play games with.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>TeamLFG's first game will include a wide range of inspirations, including one odd one. The statement reads, "Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games." Not only does this list not include shooters, the genre Bungie is best known for, but it also includes "frog-type games," a genre none of the staff at Game Informer is familiar with. If the studio's goal was to pique our curiosity, it succeeded.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sega has been making a concerted push into the multimedia space in recent years. The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>theatrical&nbsp;trilogy has led the charge since 2020, but just last year, we also received the Amazon MGM Studios-produced streaming series&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza&nbsp;</em>on Prime Video. On top of that, Sega has announced adaptations based on Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and other franchises in the future. The company isn't stopping there, however, as a new report attaches actress Sydney Sweeney and director Michael Bay to an upcoming adaptation of the arcade driving series OutRun.</p>

<p>This report, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">comes from <em>Deadline</em></a>, attaches Sweeney as producer, Bay as director, and Jayson Rothwell as scriptwriter. Additionally, Sega senior executive officer Toru Nakahara will produce from Sega's side, while Sega President and Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi will oversee the project. Nakahara has produced every project in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>film series, including the Paramount Plus&nbsp;<em>Knuckles</em>&nbsp;show. He is also lined up to produce the Streets of Rage movie. Utsumi has served as executive producer on <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Knuckles,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>.</p>

<p>Sweeney is best known for her roles in shows like&nbsp;<em>Euphoria</em>, <em>White Lotus</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>, as well as films like&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.&nbsp;</em>Though best known for her onscreen work, according to <em>Deadline</em>'s report, Sweeney is only attached as a producer at this point. Bay is known as a longtime director of action films, including&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys, Armageddon</em>, five&nbsp;<em>Transformers</em>&nbsp;films, and&nbsp;<em>Pearl Harbor</em>. Rothwell wrote for&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arachnid</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The film is being developed by Universal Pictures, though plot details are scarce at the moment, according to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>. You may note that Universal Pictures is also the studio behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which is the studio's third highest-grossing film of all time, behind only&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Furious 7.&nbsp;</em>While OutRun hardly has the name recognition of Super Mario Bros., it stands to reason that Universal would want to return to the video-game-adaptation well that brought them success with both <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i>&nbsp;and <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>.&nbsp;</p>
