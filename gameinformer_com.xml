            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nacon, the publisher behind the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/greedfall-the-dying-world">GreedFall: The Dying World</a> and other games like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hell-is-us/brains-over-brawn">Hell Is Us</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, has filed for insolvency. In other words, Nacon is out of money; as such, the publisher has requested the initiation of judicial reorganization proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p>Insolvency, in this instance, means Nacon is unable to pay the debts it owes to a debtor. Insolvency typically involves companies that have assets with value – publishing rights, IP, and the like, in this case – but lack the hard cash needed to make payments it owes. &nbsp;And because the debtor is seeking payment, non-cash assets that might otherwise be up for sale have little leverage if they don't add up to the funds owed, which is likely the situation Nacon is in.</p><p>"In a video game sector marked by long investment cycles and significant transformations, on [February 20, 2026], Nacon announced that the situation of is majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations," the <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf">filing</a> reads.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFbgFsAzz9Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFbgFsAzz9Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"The Company indicated on this occasion that its liquidity situation required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations, and that it was considering procedures intended to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the Court," the filing continues. "To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this context, the Company will, as of today, file for [insolvency]."</p><p>As for what this means for upcoming games like GreedFall: The Dying World, which launches into 1.0 on March 12 after years of Early Access, it probably means nothing – GreedFall: The Dying World, which is a sequel to Spiders Studios' 2019 <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/greedfall">GreedFall</a>, will likely launch as planned next month. In the longer term, Nacon's filing says the aim of insolvency is to "assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework. This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan."&nbsp;</p><p>Another wrinkle to this insolvency filing is that Nacon is set to hold its Nintendo Direct-style showcase – Nacon Connect – next week on March 4. That's likely to still happen, though, similar to GreedFall: The Dying World's launch the following week. Nacon also just launched <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>, the third game in the stealth series that started in 2014 with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/styx-master-of-shadows">Styx: Master of Shadows</a>, last week on February 19.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2rp4yWv49c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2rp4yWv49c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>Game Informer </em>will update this story if it learns more about Nacon's ongoing insolvency efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/robocop-rogue-city/serving-the-public-trust"><em>Game Informer's </em>RoboCop: Rogue City review</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/greedfall/greedfall-review-empowering-choice">check out our thoughts on the first GreedFall</a>.
