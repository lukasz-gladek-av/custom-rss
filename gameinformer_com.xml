            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Earlier this Summer, Dark Horse Comics and Hasbro's Wizards of the Coast revealed "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks", an all-new Forgotten Realms D&amp;D adventure comic series written by Greg Pak, penciled by Wilton Santos, inked by Advan Alves, colored by Raul Angulo, and lettered by Nate Piekos. This four-issue miniseries begins when Issue #1 arrives this October, but ahead of its release, <em>Game Informer </em>can exclusively reveal a look at a special new art piece and never-before-seen character sketches.&nbsp;</p><p>The four issues will feature art by Marguerite Sauvage, Uzuri, Stephen Segovia, and Dan Panosian, but all four issues will include back cover art by Julie Dillon which, when collected, connect in an homage to J.C. Leyendecker. For the first time ever, you can get a look at what those four back cover art pieces look like when connected here at <em>Game Informer</em> – check it out below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's not all, though, because we also have a first look at never-before-seen character sketches for "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks" from artist Wilton Santos that you can view below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside these character sketches, we have some details for each:&nbsp;</p><h3>Tessalynde (Tess) Halendria: The Rogue – Elf</h3><p><em>Tess is a professional young infiltrator who always has a plan.</em></p><p>Tess was such a proficient thief as a child—and caused so much havoc in her small town—that her overwhelmed parents sent her to the city to train with an elderly halfling rogue famed for her good deeds. Now, with the skills of a master burglar, tempered by the conscience to use them for good, she pursues high-stakes jobs and big-time coin, always striving to keep her party safe.</p><h3>Anson Iro: The Fighter – Human</h3><p><em>Anson always gets back up when he’s knocked down, even if staying down is smarter.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Orphaned at a young age, Anson and his brother were polarized by their boyhood trauma. While Anson chose the path of a righteous warrior, his brother embraced a life of crime. Still, Anson refuses to give up on his only surviving family member. Having lost so much, Anson clings to what’s his, even if it’s broken.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cazrin Varaith: The Wizard – Human</h3><p><em>Cazrin is a walking reference library who enthusiastically shares her knowledge whether you want it or not.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Cazrin’s long-ago ancestress was a wizard who launched devastating attacks on elite institutions of magical learning in the belief that magic should be accessible to all. The horror of these actions prevents the Varaith family from using magic to this day. But Cazrin has taught herself the fundamentals of spellcasting by recovering scraps of her ancestress’s knowledge. A fearless experimenter, she will test any theory in the name of learning.</p><h3>Lark Silverstring: The Bard – Tiefling</h3><p><em>A born showman who attracts attention and trouble in equal measure.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Lark lives to perform. But that’s a problem when he’s being hounded by dangerous bounty hunters and a small but dedicated fanbase. Consumed by the need to entertain, he routinely blows his own cover and must scramble out of the spotlight. As his old band enjoys widespread fame, Lark evades pursuers and questions about who wants him and why.</p><h3>Baldric Goodhand: The Cleric – Dwarf</h3><p><em>A smooth talker who negotiates for spells with a variety of gods.</em></p><p>Baldric’s certain he can talk his way out of anything. Though a man of the cloth, he refuses to pledge service to a single god, preferring to bargain for spells and favors from the entire pantheon. His unconventional relationship with the gods gives him a freewheeling confidence. But while he’s jaded with the divine, his faith in fellow mortals runs deep.</p><hr><p>"In a time of fickle dogs and feckless governors, the world yearns for heroes," a press release about this comic series reads. "What it gets are the Fallbacks – a party of daring, dubious, and dysfunctional adventurers who arrive in the city of Loudwater in search of gold and glory. But an encounter with kobold thieves puts the Fallbacks in the crosshairs of a rival team of deeply annoying local heroes. Will the Fallbacks pull off a heist for the ages? Or will they sacrifice it all to put these 'heroes' in their place?"</p><p>Here's a look at the different covers for Issue #1:&nbsp;</p><p>The Fallbacks begins this October with Issue #1 from Dark Horse Comics.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to be checking out Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks in October? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/08/27/dungeons-dragons-the-fallbacks-get-an-exclusive-look-at-new-art-and-character]]></content:encoded>
