            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Solo developer Immersiv Games reached out to me back in June to check out its non-linear adventure game, Arcadian Days, during Steam Next Fest, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/06/13/the-25-best-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try">it ended up being one of my favorite demos from the event</a>. Now, Immersiv Games has revealed Arcadian Days hits Steam Early Access on September 16, and if you're looking for something relaxing and unique to check out, I'd recommend giving it a shot.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2L7IvxgwNo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2L7IvxgwNo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>During the Steam Next Fest demo, I was impressed by its minimalist, free-flowing exploration and sun-kissed visuals â€“ throughout the demo, a gorgeous sunset created a painterly backdrop to my leisurely tasks, which included collecting plants for a crop or wood in a shed. The tasks I experienced weren't too challenging, and completing them took little effort, but Immersiv Games' self-proclaimed "non-linear" and "relaxing" makes me think this is by design. Though I love me some fast-paced, high-intensity action games, Arcadian Days' demo reminded me that it's equally as rewarding to check out a game that asks you to slow down and breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>I look forward to seeing how the Arcadian Days evolves during its Early Access period. Arcadian Days launches on PC via Steam Early Access on September 16.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, check out my Arcadian Days demo thoughts in this round-up <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/06/13/the-25-best-steam-next-fest-demos-you-need-to-try">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/arcadian-days-a-relaxing-non-linear-adventure-hits-early-access-next-month]]></content:encoded>
