Howard told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview"><em>GQ</em></a><em> </em>this in a new interview, where he also teased that, when TES VI is ready for release, the company might shadow-drop it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>GQ </em>mentions <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/22/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-available-today">Bethesda shadow-dropping The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> back in April, and asks if the company could "actually do that with" TES VI.

It worked out well."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkFdqqyI8y4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkFdqqyI8y4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>While not definitive, it sounds like shadow dropping TES VI is a possibility one day, but given Howard also told&nbsp;<em>GQ&nbsp;</em>the game is still a long way off — more than seven years after its initial reveal — it will be a while before we see anything like that happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Howard says Bethesda has "hundreds" of people working on the Fallout franchise right now, between <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and "other things we're doing," but notes that TES VI "is the everyday thing."&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more one day, read about some <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/01/04/new-elder-scrolls-6-tease-fires-up-location-theories-once-more">TES VI location theories</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/26/bethesda-gives-a-small-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-6">check out the latest TES VI update</a> prior to today.
