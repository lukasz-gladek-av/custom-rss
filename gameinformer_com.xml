            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Season four of Marvel Rivals is officially known as The Heart of the Dragon, and it's introducing one character fans of the (super) hero shooter have been hoping for: Daredevil. In the cinematic reveal trailer, he faces off against Angela, the long lost sister of Thor and the other character joining the roster. You can check it out for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer shows the two characters seemingly acting as representatives of Heaven and Hell. This is a particularly interesting take on Daredevil, as his stories, especially in the recent live-action series, traditionally focus on street-level crime with minimal super powers. In this trailer, he also seems to unleash energized punches and a powerful devil form. It's hard to tell what his canonical abilities are, versus what are stylized visuals for the animation, but Marvel Rivals sometimes provides original takes on characters and their origin stories, so it could go either way.</p><p>"The Timestream Entanglement has drawn the Seven Capitals together, forming the Heart of Heaven. After Knull’s fall, Hela is imprisoned in the An'Hay-Zhidi, where Dizang—Devil of the Eighth City—dares her to atone for her sins," the video description reads. "But Angela will not forgive her betrayal. She arrives in the Heart of Heaven demanding Hela be handed over, yet its guardian refuses to surrender someone under his protection. Justice will be served and a debt will be paid."</p><p>In a following, more detailed video, the developers at Netease confirm that Angela would be a vanguard, using her ichor to form weapons and a shield. She'll also get a team-up with Thor, who will be able to throw a thunder spear which he can jump to, dealing damage upon landing. Other team ups are adjusting as well: Magik and Black Panther are losing theirs, but Magik is getting a tether ability as a part of the team up between Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange, while Black Panther is joining the team up between Namor and Hulk.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Season four will also bring other, more minor new features. A new arcade hub will hold new and returning modes like big brain blast, clone rumble, conquest, conquest (annihilation), and doom match, along with free fight, which removes limits on duplicate heroes. You'll also be able to mark your preferred heroes into a favorites tab, other players can see custom ultimate effects, and, hilariously, they're adding a slow walk setting to the PC version of the game because they "heard how much you like slow walking for superhero aura farming."</p><p>Lastly, they announced that rank placement matches are coming to the game eventually, but won't be ready in time for season four. Players have expressed frustration that each season resets them so far down the competitive ladder that it's frustrating to have to fight through lower ranks with less skilled players to get back to their standard challenge, and placement matches are a possible solution to that.</p><p>Angela and the rest of Marvel Rivals season four come to the game for free a week from Friday, on September 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/03/marvel-rivals-season-four-adds-daredevil-and-angela-to-the-roster-launches-next-week]]></content:encoded>
