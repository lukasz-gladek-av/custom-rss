            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's the first Friday of December, which means we're one step closer to the Winter holidays – whatever and however you celebrate, something tells me video games are involved, along with some relaxation, good food, great friends and family, and maybe some more video games. As the year begins to wind down, our backlogs are looking a bit more manageable and I wager I'll look at mine, download multiple games, and touch roughly none of them this month.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, it's been a <em>busy </em>week here at <em>Game Informer</em>! We wrapped up the behind-the-scenes work on our special oversized end-of-year issue, and if you aren't already a subscriber, head here to ensure that issues hit your mailbox. We also published reviews for games like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, and Octopath Traveler 0, and covered the week's biggest news, too!&nbsp;</p><p>Before we get into the staff's weekend recommendations, here's a recap of the biggest stories of the week:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Review – Worth The Wait</a></li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/marvel-cosmic-invasion/making-the-dream-work">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review – Making The Dream Work</a></li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler-0/going-from-zero-to-hero">Octopath Traveler 0 Review – Going From Zero To Hero</a></li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/03/steam-and-the-epic-games-store-refuse-to-sell-indie-horror-game-horses-heres-why">Steam And The Epic Games Store Refuse To Sell Indie Horror Game Horses – Here's Why</a></li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/paramount-announces-a-new-sonic-universe-film-for-holiday-2028">Paramount Announces A New Sonic Universe Film For Holiday 2028</a></li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/02/helldivers-movie-lands-fast-furious-director-justin-lin">Helldivers Movie Lands Fast And Furious Director Justin Lin</a></li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/sony-set-to-publish-four-player-co-op-shooter-developed-by-jj-abrams-bad-robot-games">Sony Set To Publish Four-Player Co-Op Shooter Developed By JJ Abrams' Bad Robot Games</a></li></ul></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinions/2025/12/05/the-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-december-5]]></content:encoded>
