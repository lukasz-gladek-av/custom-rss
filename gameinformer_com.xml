            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has unveiled the first trailer for Battlefield 6. While the two-minute trailer was more cinematics than actual gameplay, it sets a grim tone for the next installment.</p><p>The trailer begins with the US president giving a conference discussing a “dark day” in the country’s history after suffering a mysterious, unprovoked attack. We then see cinematic, in-engine footage of locations like New York City embroiled in all-out war, suggesting the conflict will at least partially unfold on American soil.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to a press release, Battlefield 6’s single-player campaign centers on a private military corporation called Pax Armata. Funded by former NATO states, this force threatens to ignite a global conflict.</p><p>“In Battlefield 6, the series’ incredible blend of visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom returns,” reads the press release. "Blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage or take to the skies in white-knuckle dogfights. Take part in a war filled with tanks, fighter jets, and sweeping combat at a grand scale but remember: the deadliest weapon is your squad.”</p><p>Today’s trailer ended with a teaser for the reveal of the game’s multiplayer content one week later on July 31. Billed as “The biggest moment in Battlefield history” in the press release, the designers at Battlefield Studios (which consists of developers from multiple studios such as DICE, Criterion Games, Motive Studios, and Ripple Effect) will discuss the suite of new and returning multiplayer modes, showcase the game’s maps, and broadcast the first multiplayer matches played by content creators.</p><p>Battlefield 6 does not yet have a release date or announced platforms.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31]]></content:encoded>
