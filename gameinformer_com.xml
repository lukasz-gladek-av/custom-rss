"Bulked by Mega Evolution, it uses its muscles to take hit after hit from opponents' moves and flex its own strength. After luring its opponent into attacking, it retaliates to make them flinch before diving at them using its signature move, Flying Press, to aim for victory."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out Mega Hawlucha in the new video below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>To celebrate Mega Hawlucha and the upcoming launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, The Pokémon Company International has partnered with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to host a special event at Arena México in Mexico City on September 25 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET.

<p>As for what to expect at the Summit and Direct, RGG doesn't tease anything, though it has various projects in the works like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/rgg-studios-project-century-formally-unveiled-as-stranger-than-heaven-in-new">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/04/check-out-the-first-gameplay-of-the-next-virtua-fighter">a new Virtua Fighter</a>, and almost assuredly, a new Like A Dragon project. The studio also recently released <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a>, which features new cutscenes and more, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, and fans are hoping the team might bring it to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>
