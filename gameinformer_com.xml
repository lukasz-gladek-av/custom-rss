            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been a long time coming; last month, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine-archive">we finally relaunched our physical magazine</a>, and the first issue should be arriving in subscribers' mailboxes this week. But as our readers crack open a fresh magazine to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/borderlands4">read our coverage of Borderlands 4</a> and the games industry, we're already putting the finishing touches on the next issue, and today, we're finally able to share which game is on the cover. We're thrilled to announce that the next <em>Game Informer </em>cover story will showcase Vampire: The Masquerade â€“ Bloodlines 2.</p><p>We were invited to visit The Chinese Room's studio in Brighton, England, to get an exclusive look at the game, interview the development team, and see how the sequel is coming along since its infamous developer swap in 2021. While we're not yet able to showcase the cover art itself, we can show off a screenshot featuring a dark alley illuminated by a mysterious purple mark, which looks an awful lot like the brand on the protagonist Phyre's hand. For more details about that and everything else Bloodlines 2, stay tuned for our exclusive coverage this month.</p><p>The next issue will launch digitally on July 22 at 12 PM ET/ 9 AM PT. To celebrate, we'll be streaming on Twitch starting at 11:50 AM ET/8:50 AM PT, where we'll reveal the cover art live on stream and talk about some of the stories you can expect to read in the issue. You can join us over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer">www.twitch.tv/gameinformer</a>.</p><p>This upcoming issue will also be our first to ship with a poster, for no additional charge, to all subscribers. Learn more about that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/14/the-next-game-informer-issue-includes-dd-poster-forgotten-realms-reveals">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-game-informers-next-cover-story]]></content:encoded>
