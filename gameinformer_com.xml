            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Possessor(s) is the next action game by Heart Machine, a studio best known for the well-received <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/hyper_light_drifter/b/pc/archive/2016/04/06/game-informer-hyper-light-drifter-review.aspx">Hyper Light Drifter</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/solar-ash/solar-ash-review-a-rollercoaster-of-style-and-substance">Solar Ash</a>, as well as the currently early access Hyper Light Breaker. The Metroid-style 2D search action game is coming this November, and a new trailer breaks down its story premise and combat mechanics.</p><p>Coming to PlayStation 5 and PC on November 11, the game takes place in a quarantined city overrun by demons following an interdimensional catastrophe. Players control Luca, a high school student who becomes mortally wounded during the calamity, losing both of her legs. To survive, she makes a desperate deal with a demon named Rhem to restore her body. Though Luca and Rhem donâ€™t always get along, the two must cooperate to escape the city and bring down a corrupt corporation that has been siphoning demonic energy for its own gains.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6la77h-t7rU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6la77h-t7rU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Luca uses ordinary makeshift weapons, ranging from a guitar to a computer mouse, to execute stylish directional combos and air juggles to conquer her demonic adversaries. As the journey progresses, she gains new powers to access new areas, such as a wall-running ability and a whip for swinging across gaps.&nbsp;</p><p>We played a slice of Possessor(s) during Summer Game Fest in June and were largely impressed with its well-tuned, if familiar, action. You can read our full impressions <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/24/metroidvania-from-the-creators-of-hyper-light-drifter">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/26/possessors-the-next-action-game-by-the-makers-of-hyper-light-drifter-and-solar-ash]]></content:encoded>
