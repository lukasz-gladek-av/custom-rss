In the series, music lead Atsuko Asahi discusses the game’s score, developing tracks, and even the fact that more than 200 songs are featured in the Mario Kart World jukebox.</p><p>These 200 songs are all new arrangements, and they were recorded live, too, according to Asahi, and if they’re anywhere near as delightful on the ears as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s</a> excellent jazz-infused score, we’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>“Altogether, over 200 for the ‘jukebox,’” Asahi <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-2/">said</a> when asked about the total number of musical pieces in Mario Kart World. “These are all brand-new arrangements, and we also did live recordings. We prepared pieces from quite a wide variety of musical genres. I believe those who are well-versed in video game music, as well as those who aren’t, will enjoy listening to them.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Asahi is asked about the challenge of crafting background music and integrating tracks into Mario Kart World’s open world design. Asahi explained music for the designated courses came first, then the open world parts of the game.</p><p>“First, we created music for the courses like we’ve always done before and then thought about what to do for the roads outside the courses,” Asahi said. “We decided to have two different kinds of music depending on how you’re playing. For the Knockout Tour mode, we started off by simply trying to connect the course themes. But that approach didn’t work well. It ended up sounding weird because the tracks have different tempos and beats. So, we decided to find a way to end each of the course themes, even though they’re connected by the route.</p><p>“Video game music often plays on a loop, and in this game, too, the same music keeps playing if you’re driving laps around a course. But for Knockout Tour, as you get closer to the next course, the music transitions to the outro, so the theme ends nicely. We also created a new intro for each course theme, which starts to play shortly before you reach the gate, building excitement. Then, as you actually pass through the gate, it changes to the theme of the course you’ve entered. By repeating this, it feels like a medley is playing along to you live, creating a sense of immersion.”</p>

<p>For other modes in Mario Kart World, like the open world Free Roam, Asahi said the team prepared lots of music in addition to the course tracks, and that the game automatically selects the right track depending on the situation. During development, the team referred to this carousel of music as the “jukebox,” and that’s how the jukebox feature made it into Mario Kart World.</p><p>Mario Kart World launches exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p>For more, read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/22/nintendo-considered-lowering-resolution-frame-rate-for-mario-kart-world-before-changing">Nintendo considered dropping the resolution and frame rate of Mario Kart World</a> before changing development to Switch 2.

In this interview series, Yabuki is asked how many courses are in the game, to which he responds that there are more than 100.</p><p>Yabuki explained that because Mario Kart World is designed as an open world racing game with lots of terrain and more to explore en route and between designed race tracks, it’s tough to quantify the number of courses. However, if you add up all the possible variations, the number exceeds 100, according to Yabuki.</p>

<p>“In this game, you don’t just race on the courses,” he said in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-2/">interview</a>. “The areas between courses are also used for racing. So it’s as if there are courses spread out all over the world, and if you were to add up all the possible variations, it would easily exceed 100.”</p><p>The interviewer then joked that Yabuki said earlier that Mario Kart World’s design philosophy wasn’t about increasing the amount of content, despite the game doing just that. Yabuki added, “Since it’s now a single, interconnected world, it’s hard to do a direct comparison with the last game, but in the pursuit of approachability and fun in this new, vast world, the volume of content we had to create in terms of visual design, programming, and audio increased dramatically.</p><p>“And as a result, the gameplay is more varied than ever before.”</p><p>We’ll all discover how varied the gameplay is in two weeks when Mario Kart World launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting"><em>Game Informer’s</em> hands-on preview of Mario Kart World</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/22/nintendo-considered-lowering-resolution-frame-rate-for-mario-kart-world-before-changing">Nintendo considered dropping the resolution and frame rate</a> of Mario Kart World before changing development to the Switch 2.
