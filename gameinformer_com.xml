Late last week, we learned that the studio in question would be A24 (<em>Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>) and it already had a director attached â€“ Alex Garland, who has directed several projects with the studio, including this year's&nbsp;<em>Warfare&nbsp;</em>and last year's&nbsp;<em>Civil War</em>. Today,&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-warfare-kit-connor-the-dish-1236412868/'"><em>Deadline&nbsp;</em>reported</a> that an actor in the former project is set to star in Garland's Elden Ring film.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Kit Connor is in talks to play the lead in the From Software adaptation, but no formal deal has been offered yet, according to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>. Given that players in the video game play as silent custom characters known as the Tarnished, it's likely Connor portrays one of them, though it's unclear what exactly that will look like. While he's known best for his role as Nick Nelson in the Netflix series&nbsp;<em>Heartstopper</em>, Connor is not a total stranger to performing in video game stories, portraying Lucas in 2022's A Plague Tale: Requiem.</p><p dir="ltr">A24 had no comment on the report, according to <em>Deadline</em>, which is unsurprising, given that any potential deal has yet to go through. Given that the movie is still in its earliest phases, we likely won't expect it to release any time soon, assuming it gets made at all. While this movie was announced second, it will be interesting to see whether it beats&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/death-stranding-movie-lands-the-director-of-a-quiet-place-day-one">the Death Stranding adaptation</a> to the box office.</p><p dir="ltr">We, like most gaming outlets, adored Elden Ring at release,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring/absolutely-astonishing-adventure">granting it the rare&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em> 10/10</a>. We were also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/an-emphatic-exclamation-point">big fans of its huge DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, and to a lesser extent,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">enjoyed Elden Ring Nightreign, which will launch tomorrow</a>. For more Elden Ring, you can read about how one of our editors declared it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2025/05/12/the-worst-games-to-play-with-a-newborn-at-home">one of the worst games to play with a newborn at home</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-warfare-kit-connor-the-dish-1236412868/"><em>Deadline</em></a>]</p><hr><p><em>What do you want to see in an Elden Ring film?
