            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> is one of the best indie games of recent memory, distilling the risk/reward formula of roguelikes into a concentrated rush of challenge and achievement. Its success has prompted it to cross over with all sorts of games, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/impressions/2024/05/10/vampire-survivors-contra-dlc-shows-one-of-gamings-best-values-still-has" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ffd11bbf-fa2a-4f83-9a24-4aeea4fea496" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Contra</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/10/vampire-survivors-announces-crossover-with-square-enixs-saga-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9b63d83c-34e6-4574-a933-19ef91aa2246" data-entity-substitution="canonical">SaGa</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/vampire-survivors-balatro-update-is-out-today-alongside-more-castlevania-content-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fed2db4-75fb-4ae3-9c71-2ccfd7861673" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Balatro</a>, and Castlevania, but today we learned of the first fully new game to take the formula and run: Warhammer Survivors.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's exactly what it sounds like. The standalone game stars characters from Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar in the classic Vampire Survivors format, complete with hordes of enemies, simple, pixelated graphics, and treasure chests that make you feel like you hit the jackpot in Vegas. The game is not developed by Poncle, which created the original Vampire Survivors, but by Auroch Digital, the developer of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, using Poncle's engine.</p><p>Warhammer Survivors content is pretty evenly divided between the world of 40,000 and Age of Sigmar, with several maps, weapons, and characters from each universe. According to a press release, the characters revealed so far include Malum Caedo, Cadian Shock Trooper Kozlowski, Space Marine Intercessor Brother Luca, Neave Blacktalon, Gotrek Gurnisson, and Stormcast Eternal Vanquisher Sharynn Azurwrath. Each character comes with unique abilities and a different starting weapon, which include the Boltgun, Astartes Chainsword, and Whirlwind Axes.</p><p>Warhammer Survivors is set to launch next year. For now, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669620/Warhammer_Survivors/">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/04/warhammer-survivors-puts-space-marines-in-the-vampire-survivors-engine]]></content:encoded>
