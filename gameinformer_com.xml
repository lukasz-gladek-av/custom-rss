            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Seven years ago, this would have been my weekly recommendation of what to play – after all, I did put over 1,000 hours into the original Overwatch – but if you told me coming into 2026 that I'd be back into it, I would have laughed at you. But here we are; Overwatch's recent complete overhaul, which saw the game stripped of the "2" in its title, made me curious enough to jump back in. As a regular player from 2016 to 2019, Overwatch sits near the top of my personal favorite games of all time, but following the announcement of Overwatch 2 back in 2019, the title fell off hard. Content slowed to a drip as the team focused on Overwatch 2's story content, most of which never saw the light of day. Then, when Overwatch 2 arrived, I still enjoyed it (I <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/overwatch-2/a-heroic-return">gave it an 9 out of 10</a>, after all), but it was a far cry from the novelty and excitement surrounding the original game during those first several years.</p><p>This reworking of the entire game is so much more than just a simple title rebrand; in addition to a more prominent story, complete with Blizzard's famously great cinematics, it's also refocusing on what players love. A permanent 6v6 mode is there for those who favor the original Overwatch team compositions. A ton of new heroes are joining the roster this year (including five heroes just this week), completely flipping any existing Meta on its head. And speaking of Meta, the new Conquest Meta Event has you pick a faction and fight for it over the course of a five-week event, earning rewards every step of the way. As someone who hasn't played the game for several years now, I'm struggling to not only rewire my rusty muscle memory, but also relearn my favorite heroes, as many of them have received reworks in my absence. It's a little overwhelming, and many of my old strategies now fail, but I'm having a blast dipping my toe back in. And when I am able to go on a run as one of my old favorites, I'm reminded precisely why I fell in love with this game in the first place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/13/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-13]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warhorse Studios has surprise-dropped a free <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> update on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S that brings the game up to Ultra Quality-like PC visuals on consoles. That includes 60 FPS performance, 4K resolution upscaling, improved textures and assets, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Out now, this update is free to all existing owners of Kingdom Come: Deliverance on PlayStation and Xbox, and if you don't already own the game, you can pick it up on digital storefronts for $29.99. In a new "Next-Gen Update" trailer highlighting the game's PS5 and Xbox Series X/S enhancements, Warhorse reveals Kingdom Come: Deliverance has surpassed 10 million copies sold, which is more than double the 4 million copies sold of its sequel, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/best-of-2025/2025/12/16/editor-top-10s-of-2025">which was my Number Two game of the year in 2025</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gLXjKFYQg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gLXjKFYQg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h3>My Quick Kingdom Come: Deliverance Next-Gen Update Impressions</h3><p>As you can see, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is looking better than ever. I adored Kingdom Come: Deliverance II last year, but I had actually never played its predecessor. With how much I enjoyed Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, I'm happy to report that in my early hours with this updated version of the first game, I'm having a great time. Something I especially appreciate is that Warhorse seemingly held great restraint when essentially remastering this game – it looks very much like the original release, but is just a bit easier on the eyes. The artistic vision of that first game remains intact, and based on comparisons I've been seeing, there aren't any major changes that disrespect what the original developers accomplished more than half a decade ago.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, that is an ideal enhancement update: make it run better, increase the resolution, and lightly touch up the other areas of the game. It's okay if that knight still kind of looks a little wonky – it's the knight your original players of the 2018 came to enjoy seeing on their screen, and I like that this update upholds that. Even the gameplay matches that of the original game, and while that's for the worse when compared to the across-the-board improvements made in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, it's nice to experience this game with a new coat of paint and come to understand the context in which its fans came to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's why, when I watched <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> for the first time in the late 2010s, I chose the original version– not <em>Kai</em>, which essentially trims the filler and remasters the visuals. <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>is a beloved anime, and I wanted to see it the way its long-time fans originally did; I appreciate Goku's adventures more because of that. I imagine I'm going to roll credits on Kingdom Come: Deliverance on my PS5, feeling the same.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read my <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/a-medieval-day-epic">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II review</a> to find out why it was one of my favorite games of 2025, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/kingdom_come_deliverance/b/xboxone/archive/2018/02/28/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-game-informer.aspx"><em>Game Informer's </em>review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> to learn what we thought of it in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information about this update, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance/kingdom-come-deliverance-patch-197-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">you can check out the full patch notes here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you excited to check out this update for Kingdom Come: Deliverance?
