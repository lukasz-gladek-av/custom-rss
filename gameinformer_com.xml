            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/17/john-wick-inspired-action-game-spine-coming-to-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Spine was first announced in 2021 as a multiplayer game, but after a couple of years in development, developer Nekki changed course. Today, Spine is a cinematic single-player game that draws heavy inspiration from action-packed blockbusters like&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em>​​​​​​. Using free-flow gun-fu combat, Spine has drawn the attention of a large population of players, attracting more than 400,000 wishlists according to the publisher. Today, Nekki showed off new gameplay footage of the cyberpunk action title, announced a new ultra-difficult Hardcore mode, and shared that the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>In Spine, you control Redline, the highly trained protagonist who can seamlessly move from enemy to enemy by parrying them, disarming them, and defeating them with her weapons, in hand-to-hand combat, or by turning their own weapons against them. She can also resourcefully use items in the environment as makeshift weapons and smash enemies into various surfaces in the world. The camera is specifically designed to put the player in the action so they feel like they are in an action movie.</p>

<p>In addition to announcing that the game is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nekki also revealed Hardcore mode. In this mode, Redline cannot take any damage, which is represented by a special pair of sunglasses she wears in this mode. In order to keep the sunglasses intact, she must make it through untouched by enemy fire or strikes.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer showing off the combat below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZbHDdd5drA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Freeflow Gun Fu combat means constant tactical awareness – both of your enemies and of the surroundings in which you fight," game director Dmitry Pimenov said in a press release. "For us, everything comes back to that cinematic experience, while always giving players complete control. We want to make players feel like both the star and the director of their own action movie, rewarding them with opportunities for creative takedowns by mastering the combo system and the environment, and showcasing their combos with dynamic camera angles to immerse them in the action."</p>

<p>Spine doesn't currently have a release date, but it was originally scheduled for a 2025 release. However, the Steam page currently says "To be announced," while the press release makes no mention of a release window. It is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/mario-kart-world-modes-and-courses-detailed-free-roam-features-missions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mario Kart World is Nintendo's big launch title for Nintendo Switch 2, and for good reason. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/mario_kart_8_deluxe/b/switch/archive/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-game-informer-review.aspx">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, despite being an enhanced version of a Wii U game, has sold nearly 70 million copies, making it one of the five best-selling video games of all time, and the franchise typically lands in the top five best-selling games on nearly every system it appears on. Naturally, Nintendo sees the first all-new Mario Kart game in more than a decade as a big-ticket item, which could explain the $80 price tag. However, it also explains the confidence Nintendo has to launch the successor to its most successful console of all time with Mario Kart World. During today's Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct, we learned how players can engage with the big launch title of Nintendo Switch 2, as Nintendo detailed the various modes, as well as several of the courses.</p>

<p>Grand Prix</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9d8a3a5b-fd7a-43b6-871d-b7b88ad76778" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Grand Prix</h4>

<p>As I experienced during my hands-on time with Mario Kart World (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting">read my full preview here</a>), the game features two flagship modes: Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix sets you up with a series of four races as you try and place well enough that you land on the podium at the end of the four races. Players can race through new and returning courses (see below), but the difference in Mario Kart World is that once you complete a race, you then drive to the next course alongside your opponents, hammering home the fact that this is one big, interconnected world. Grand Prix organizes the courses into four-race Cups, with seven Cups available – Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, Shell Cup, Banana Cup, Leaf Cup, and Lightning Cup. However, the Direct heavily implies that if you take home gold in all seven Cups, you will at least unlock Rainbow Road, though it's more likely you'll unlock an entire Special Cup.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour</p>

</article><h4>Knockout Tour</h4>

<p>The other big mode Nintendo has shown is Knockout Tour. Here, you race in elimination matches across multiple checkpoints. Each time you pass through a checkpont, you must be better than the position shown in the checkpoint gate or you're eliminated. With 24 players available in every race – not to mention the Mario Kart tendency to hit you hardest when you're on top – Knockout Tour competitions are chaotic and stressful, but during my time playing the game, this mode served as the highlight.</p>

<p>Time Trials</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e7018dbf-3973-4acc-be52-07a4e60b5e61" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Time Trials</h4>

<p>During today's Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct, we also learned about the other modes players can participate in. In Time Trials, you can hone your skills to post the best time possible across the various courses without worrying about other racers getting in your way or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/every-new-item-and-trick-in-the-mario-kart-world-direct">hitting you with items</a>. If you go online, you can compete against Ghost data from across the globe. As with previous iterations of the mode, it appears as though players start with three Mushrooms, which must be used judiciously to score the best time.</p>

<p>VS Race</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="123488ba-4d11-4f06-8bd2-8afc0fe477a5" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>VS Race</h4>

<p>If you'd prefer real competition, you can enter into VS Race, which allows you to compete against a full field of 24 racers, including real humans and COM drivers. You can select the courses you want to race with the traditional three-lap format or even compete by racing between specific courses. The ruleset is also fully customizable; you can select what class you want to race in (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc), split the 24 drivers into up to four teams, select or restrict specific items, designate the COM driver difficulty, and choose how many races are in the series.</p>

<p>Battle Mode</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b250456e-160a-4f00-9860-ff4651469abb" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Battle Mode</h4>

<p>The franchise mainstay Battle Mode also makes its return in Mario Kart World. The Battle Mode present in Mario Kart World seems more in line with the series' traditional offering as seen in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, rather than the unpopular version found in the Wii U version of Mario Kart 8. Battle Mode can be played locally or online, with two modes announced: Balloon Battle and Coin Runners. Balloon Battle gives players a set number of balloons to represent their hit points. Each time you take damage, one of your balloons pops. You are eliminated from the match if all of your balloons are destroyed. Coin Runners first debuted in Mario Kart Wii, with the main objective of collecting as many coins as possible while preventing your opponents from collecting more than you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Free Roam</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b0010571-26cc-4693-b0fd-f6079fbfbb29" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Free Roam</h4>

<p>If you just want to explore Mario Kart World's vast region free from the fires of competition, you can do so in Free Roam. Here, you can run along the roads, go off-roading, or even speed down the rivers as you uncover every nook and cranny this open world has to offer. As you drive around, you can engage with various side objectives. One such objective presents itself in the form of P-Switches. Once you activate a P-Switch, a mission begins, requiring you to show off your skills. In the Direct, one objective involves jumping between multiple rails to collect blue coins, while another task involves reaching a goal while dodging incoming boulders within a set time limit. Nintendo claims there are hundreds of P-Switches across the world. You can also find collectibles such as hidden coins like the Peach Medallion shown in the Direct, hidden panels to activate, and more secrets. While in Free Roam, which can be done solo or with friends, you can access Photo Mode at any time.</p>

<p>Multiplayer</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8c281b99-2489-49c5-b719-57ee301f33dd" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Local and Online Play</h4>

<p>If you'd like to play with friends (or strangers), you can hop online to compete in the various modes on offer in the Mario Kart World package. Mario Kart World supports up to 4-player splitscreen, as well as local wireless for up to 8 players, with two players allowed on each individual Switch 2 system. Up to 24 players can compete online, with a maximum of 2 players on each system. While you're waiting for players to join and ready up, you are placed in a joint Free Roam session so that you can explore with the other players. By opening the map, you can see where the other players in the session are and teleport to them immediately for cooperative exploration. If you have the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/mario-kart-worlds-cameraplay-lets-you-broadcast-your-live-facial">use GameChat features</a> and even superimpose each player's face over their character so you can know who is playing as who at a moment's notice and see their reactions in real time.</p>

<p>Course List</p>

<p>Mario Kart World is poised to be the most ambitious Mario Kart game yet. However, the $80 price tag has stirred up sufficient controversy. Nintendo has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d07f55a-1a29-495e-8613-f59f3047c54b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">justified the price tag</a> by saying it priced the game based on the value it brings to players, but many still decry the price as too much. Still, as the flagship launch title of the Nintendo Switch 2, it will likely sell well off the starting line, even with preorder details for the console still up in the air in the wake of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">ongoing tariff saga in the United States</a>.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World launches alongside Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. For more on the new game in the beloved franchise, check out our hands-on preview of Mario Kart World <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e91306ba-da57-4a47-8e31-de54d59fabe4" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting">here</a>.</p>

<p>GameChat allows for in-game voice chat, allowing players to speak to each other during online races using the Switch 2’s built-in microphone. You can also watch each other's live game screens broadcast to the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that players can use GameChat without subscribing to Nintendo Switch Online until March 31, 2026. After that, a Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CameraPlay allows owners of the Switch 2 camera to capture live footage of their face, which appears in-game as a portrait over their driver. This allows players to see each other’s live reactions as they ruin each other's day in the many ways Mario Kart allows. If you’re playing four players locally, a single camera can capture everyone's faces in the room at once.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World launches on June 5 for Switch 2 at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">$79.99</a>.
