            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>My.Games has announced a new collaboration with the iconic Swedish metal band Sabaton for its long-running mobile mech PvP shooter, War Robots. The band's inclusion arrives alongside the upcoming Fire Storm event, which starts on October 28. The collaboration features art and music from the band's 11th studio album, <em>Legends</em>, which just came out on October 17.</p><p>The collaboration happened as a result of a survey that My.Games and developer Pixonic sent to its players about their interests outside of the game. According to producer Boris Burangulov, an overwhelming number of players said rock and metal were their favorite genres of music, and that Sabaton topped the list of most-loved bands within the community.&nbsp;</p><p>"When Pixonic approached us with the results of that survey, the band was thrilled," Sabaton bassist, manager, and co-founder Pär Sundström said in a press release. "It was humbling to learn that so many players chose us. We thought about the best way to say thank you. And here we are: with this little collaboration, we’re bringing one of our new songs straight to the hangars! We hope the players enjoy it."</p>

      <p>The new hangar, which draws inspiration from Sabaton's new album, Legends</p>
  
</article>

<p>War Robots players and Sabaton fans can expect one of the tracks off <em>Legends</em>, "A Tiger Among Dragons," to play as part of the in-game hangar soundtrack, as well as a new <em>Legends</em>-inspired hangar. This new hangar pulls inspiration from the new album's art, which publisher My.Games says "perfectly syncs with the atmosphere of War Robots – a world of steel, fire, and conflict."&nbsp;</p><p>We had the exclusive opportunity to interview Sabaton's Pär Sundström about the collaboration. You can read his thoughts on the collaboration below.</p><hr><p><strong>Game Informer: When you were approached for this collaboration, was "A Tiger Among Dragons" the first song that came to mind to put into a game like this?</strong></p><p><strong>Sabaton's Pär Sundström: </strong>I’ve felt strongly for “A Tiger Among Dragons” since the day we wrote it. It has a unique sound and it really stands out. I always believed the song would have a life outside of the ordinary heavy metal stories we create as a band.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months ago, we invited some people from War Robots to our office to listen to the whole <em>Legends</em> album, and I am happy that they liked "A Tiger Among Dragons" and thought it would be suitable for the game.</p><p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the themes of the song and how you think it will fit into a game like War Robots?</strong></p><p>All the songs on <em>Legends</em> are quite old stories. Some are more famous than others, but all fit the idea of what a legend is. This was the basis for the album; if someone has done something in life that’s still valid a very long time after the deed is done, it turns into a legend. Our song "A Tiger Among Dragons" tells the story of Lü Bu, the Chinese warlord, which is perfectly suitable for a video game, for sure. The song has a kind of machine-like sound to it, thanks to the rhythm section, fitting for ancient warriors as well as futuristic mechs.&nbsp;</p><p>Lü Bu was known as the Flying General and was one of the fiercest warriors in all of ancient China. His duel at Hulao Pass, where he took on the best fighters of his age, turned him from man to legend. He’s basically the kind of figure that is worthy of a song. "A Tiger Among Dragons" dives into that mix of glory and madness; the rush of battle, the betrayal, the hunger for power, and the loneliness that comes with being unstoppable. In a game like War Robots, that energy fits perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>Rock and its various subgenres have experienced many ebbs and flows in terms of popularity and mainstream appeal. What does it say to you that the community of War Robots chose a metal band as their favorite? What was your first reaction when you heard Sabaton topped the list?</strong></p><p>It says everything about the War Robots community. Firstly, they’ve got great taste! Secondly, they’ve got a taste for battle soundtracks, not just background noise.&nbsp;</p><p>The metal genre was at a low point when we started the band; the end of the '90s was not the greatest time for our genre. But metal is not supposed to be trendy. It’s music for the people who live and breathe it, who love it. And bands like Sabaton never tried to fit in, be mainstream, be trendy… We just did our own thing, and today, there are more fans around who grew up with the classic heavy metal that is around to enjoy concerts.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing many of the classic old bands sell out huge stadiums proves that rock and metal is a music genre that the fans stay with for life.</p><p><strong>Have you had a chance to see the </strong><em><strong>Legends</strong></em><strong>-themed hangar? How do you feel it represents the band?</strong></p><p>I was actually involved in the design. We wanted to make the players recognize themselves, but still add a few elements that were Sabaton. Since the collaboration is about paying respect to players, we wanted to ensure that the Sabaton presence in the game did not take up too much space.</p><hr><p>War Robots launched in 2014 on iOS as Walking War Robots. It eventually came to Android in 2015. As of this writing, it has a 4.7 out of 5 user score on iOS, based on over 588,000 reviews, and a 4.3 on Android from 4.35 million user reviews from its 300 million registered users across its 11-year lifecycle. It also has a console and PC counterpart, War Robots: Frontiers, which arrived in March 2025. That game currently has a "Mixed" rating on Steam, with nearly 2,000 English-language user reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire Storm event begins in War Robots on October 28 and runs through December 9. The Sabaton collaboration is available via the new 11.5 update.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/10/23/metal-band-sabaton-talks-collaboration-with-war-robots]]></content:encoded>
