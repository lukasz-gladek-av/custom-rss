The difficult 2D platformer was a popular game on the platform, and though it has never received a proper numbered sequel, it has been given a few spin-offs like Super Meat Boy Forever and Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtXRCarKd9A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtXRCarKd9A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Super Meat Boy 3D, however, looks to be its biggest follow-up yet. The game is fully 3D and looks every bit as challenging as the games that preceded it. It also features the ghosts of previous attempts, which is a staple for the series.</p><p>The game is apparently being developed by Sluggerfly (Hell Pie), Headup Games (Casual Loop), and Team Meat.</p><p>The game is coming coming Xbox Platforms early next year.</p>
