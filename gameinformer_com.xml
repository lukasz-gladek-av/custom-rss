            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has revealed the launch date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows' first story expansion. It also detailed other significant updates coming as part of the summer stretch of its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-year-1-roadmap-includes-story-expansion-parkour-improvements-new">Year 1 content roadmap</a>.</p><p>Claws of the Awaji, the game’s first big story DLC, is launching on September 16. Set after the conclusion of Shadow’s events (meaning you need to beat the game to unlock it), it centers on Naoe tackling a fresh slate of foes on the new island setting of Awaji. The expansion is touted to feature over 10 hours of content and will be free to players who pre-ordered Shadows. It is unclear how much Claws of Awaji will cost to purchase standalone.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New Game Plus arrives in an update next week on July 29. The mode resets story and objective board progression, but allows players to retain their character level, gear, skill points, knowledge rank, and Hideout progression in a fresh campaign. When starting New Game Plus, players have the option of restarting the story from the very beginning or skipping the prologue and starting when Naoe first acquires the Hideout.</p><p>In terms of progression, the July update also raises the level cap from 60 to 80. New Knowledge Ranks, Mastery, and Knowledge Skill ranks will also be introduced. The Hideout will receive new upgrades, including those for Heiji’s Forge. July 29 will also add Project 3, adding new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>FromSoftware has announced major sales milestones for Elden Ring’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/an-emphatic-exclamation-point">Shadow of the Erdtree </a>expansion and its multiplayer spin-off, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, the well-received expansion for Elden Ring that released last June, has passed 10 million worldwide sales. Meanwhile, the cooperative roguelike spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign has surpassed 5 million units sold globally since launching on May 30.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This news comes after FromSoftware announced in April that the original Elden Ring had <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-shipped">shipped 30 million units</a> since launching in 2022. A Switch 2 port called Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is slated to launch later this year. Additionally, a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/23/elden-ring-live-action-movie-in-the-works-with-ex-machina-annihilation-director-alex">live-action film</a> directed by Alex Garland and developed by A24 is also in the works.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, the Elden Ring franchise has proven incredibly lucrative for From Software. Whether or not it will follow-up on that success with a proper sequel remains to be seen, but the developer has already announced its next action game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/the-duskbloods-from-softwares-next-game-is-a-switch-2-exclusive">The Duskbloods</a>, which launches exclusively for Switch 2 next year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/elden-ring-nightreign-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hit-major-sales-milestones]]></content:encoded>
