            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Helldivers 2 is coming to Xbox Series X/S on August 26. This marks the first appearance of the series on a Microsoft platform.</p><p>The cooperative third-person shooter was first released on February 8, 2024, for PlayStation 5 and PC. As soldiers defending Super Earth in 2184, players work together in three-person squads to fight in the never-ending Galactic War against the insect-like aliens, the Terminids (among other threats). Helldivers 2 on Xbox will support cross-play on all platforms.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," says Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson in a press release. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><p>This announcement is notable because while we've seen several first-party Xbox titles make the jump to PlayStation hardware in the last year, this is a more uncommon instance of a Sony-published game migrating to Microsoft's console. Helldivers 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024. We scored it a 9 out of 10 upon its release (check out our<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"> review</a>), and it also landed a spot on our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/20/game-informers-belated-top-10-games-of-2024-awards">Top 10 Games of 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august]]></content:encoded>
