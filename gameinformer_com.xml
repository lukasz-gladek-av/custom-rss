Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate/radical-repetition">finally made the leap from Apple Arcade to consoles last year</a>, takes several cues from Hades, but wraps it in the shells of Eastman and Laird's iconic Turtles. Earlier this year, the mask-wearing Casey Jones joined the playable roster of characters in the isometric roguelike, and now, it's Metalhead's turn.</p><p>A robotic turtle built by Donatello, Metalhead is the sixth playable character and delivers an all-new playstyle to the game. He operates as the longest-range character on the roster to date, with a laser gun, explosive landmines, and tactical skills designed to keep enemies at a distance. The story introduces Metalhead by having him accidentally open a rift under a pizzeria, and it's up to the team to stop the chaos that spills out of the rift. Additionally, the paid DLC adds five new artifacts to let you further experiment with your builds.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the paid Metalhead DLC, all players will have access to a free title update that adds an Arcade mode, new levels, a new storyline, additional powers, enemies, visual upgrades, and tuning. Arcade mode offers a fast-paced way to experience the content alone or with friends, complete with a new Hex and Flex system, which adds new variables to account for during a run; some combos you unlock will weaken you (Hexes), while others will make you stronger (Flexes). The update also adds three new biomes – the Spectral Sewers, Astral Ship, and Manic Metropolis – a new Wraith enemy set, and Enemy Invasion mechanics that unlock new encounter combinations. These updates stack with more than 100 gameplay and quality-of-life improvements, including visual polish and balancing adjustments.</p><p>Both the Metalhead paid DLC and the free update hit all versions on September 30.
