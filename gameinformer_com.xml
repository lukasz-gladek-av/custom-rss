            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you are a fan of games like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls, you know it's in the lineage of those games to feature third-person and first-person viewpoints for gameplay. That's why fans were disappointed that The Outer Worlds didn't feature third-person gameplay when Obsidian Entertainment, which developed Fallout: New Vegas, a game that included a third-person camera, launched the game in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the studio has heard the fans, and you can expect not one, but two third-person viewpoints in The Outer Worlds 2 when it launches later this month. While that will be a fun way to see your customizable Earth Directorate hero in-game, this wasn't always planned to be a feature.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"We didn't intend to do third-person when we first started the game," game director Brandon Adler tells us. "We actually didn't start doing it until, really, maybe about two years ago or so."&nbsp;</p><p>Adler says he and The Outer Worlds 2 team at Obsidian were discussing a long list of things everyone wanted to add to the game. "You're like, 'It's too expensive for us to do some of these things; maybe on the next one," Adler says, noting the team isn't saying a third Outer Worlds game is in the works but rather, hypothetically, there's a list of things it might do in another crack at the series. "But again, about halfway through, we were like, 'I think people are really going to want this,' so we did an evaluation of how difficult it was going to be to implement it."&nbsp;</p><p>Obsidian ended up collaborating with a team called Disruptive to create a third-person camera system that integrates seamlessly within the gameplay and mechanical structure of The Outer Worlds 2. That includes animation, in-world interactions, FOV, and more. And you can see that third-person gameplay in action in the clip below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).
