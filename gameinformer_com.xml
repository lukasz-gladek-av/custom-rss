            <p>The main advantage of Nintendo Switch 2 over its predecessor is its improved hardware, so it's nice that so many developers, Nintendo included, are taking advantage of it to boost Switch 1 titles.

From Stardew Valley to Hades II, here's every Switch 2 version we learned about today.</p>
