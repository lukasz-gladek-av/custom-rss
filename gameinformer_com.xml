            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a new Bungie game upon us, and if its previously released Halo and Destiny games are any indication, it’d be quite silly to outright ignore it. I mention that because, unlike Halo and Destiny, understanding what Marathon is attempting to do in the shooter genre is tougher to parse (and easy to ignore as a result). It’s an extraction live-service shooter, a niche variant in a genre that a lot of people turn their noses up to by default. That’s all well and good (and understandable if you already know this isn’t for you), but if you’re interested in seeing what one of the industry’s best shooter-makers is doing in the extraction genre, which itself is on the rise thanks to games like Arc Raiders, I recommend checking out Marathon – for free! – via this weekend’s Server Slam.</p><p>Download the Marathon Server Slam Client and hop in. That’s what I did last night, and I’ll be honest, I really struggled to parse through its UI, menus, and in-game action, but the visual-audio experience of Marathon is worth checking out alone. It is a gorgeously mixed soundscape of alien sci-fi rumbles, instruments, and tech-based beeps and boops that sounds great in a headset. And visually, it’s one of the most distinct games I’ve played in some time. As for the gameplay itself, you drop into a map, collect as much valuable loot as possible, and exfil from the map to secure said loot and reap the rewards for doing so. Moment to moment, that means you’re going to be searching around cyberpunk-esque environments for things to scavenge while avoiding (or seeking out) enemy AI and other players for firefights that play out via Bungie’s best-in-class first-person shooting.</p><p>I’m not so sure that Marathon is shaping up to be Bungie’s next Halo or Destiny, but it is, at the very least, something unique, and I’m excited to see if this extraction shooter clicks into place as I play more over the weekend. If it doesn’t, well, at least the Server Slam is free.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/27/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-27]]></content:encoded>

Amongst general sadness at the news amongst players, there was also a feeling that the studio would have been the one to (finally) do something with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, ideally a remake, considering Bluepoint's pedigree.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, according to a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>&nbsp;report, it turns out Bluepoint&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;pitch a Bloodborne remake in early 2025, but it was rejected by PlayStation due to FromSoftware's desires.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Crk_GpxGQE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Crk_GpxGQE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>says its sources told it that Bluepoint "was told that the numbers made sense [to remake Bloodborne] but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen." As the report notes, former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida theorized during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?si=kIez-r304hGEmfes"><em>Kinda Funny</em> interview last year</a> that FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki, who directed Bloodborne, was interested in remaking the 2015 action game himself but was too busy to do so; Yoshida said he "doesn't want anyone else to touch it" and that if that's true, he believes PlayStation would respect Miyazaki's wishes, even though PlayStation owns the Bloodborne IP.&nbsp;</p><p>As previously reported, Bluepoint was working on a live-service spinoff of Santa Monica Studios' <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/god-of-war">God of War</a> series (which recently got the side-scroller treatment in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta/fighting-in-the-shade-of-greater-games">God of War Sons of Sparta</a>). <em>Bloomberg </em>reports that Bluepoint's spinoff was a game in which Kratos' son, Atreus, one of the main protagonists of&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a>, fell into Hades (hell). "A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to have some sort of cooperative gameplay and ongoing support," the report reads. However, PlayStation canceled this project in January of 2025. Tasked with figuring out its next project, something PlayStation helped with, Bluepoint eventually pitched the aforementioned (rejected) Bloodborne remake.&nbsp;</p>
