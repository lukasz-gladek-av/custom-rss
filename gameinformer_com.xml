            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Scott Pilgrim EX, the beat-em-up inspired by the popular graphic novel series, is getting two more playable characters. Roxie Richter and Lucas Lee, two of the series' iconic Evil Exes, join Scott and Ramona Flowers in their fight against the vegans, robots, and demons that have taken over the city. You can see them in action in the gameplay trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZ2JNJq5s4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZ2JNJq5s4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you'd expect, both playable exes use abilities seen in their past appearances. Lucas Lee uses a skateboard as a weapon and summons his crew of stunt doubles, while Roxie Richter wields a katana with ninja-like agility. Their announcement brings Scott Pilgrim EX's playable roster up to four, but developer Tribute Games has previously announced the game would have seven total playable options, so there are still three fighters we don't know about yet.</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/scott-pilgrim-ex-is-a-new-throwback-beat-em-up">was announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. While it's not a direct sequel, it continues the legacy of 2010's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was infamously de-listed from digital marketplaces in 2014, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-complete-edition" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c11da4e-b823-40d4-9b2c-5edca714292e" data-entity-substitution="canonical">was re-released in 2021</a>. Scott Pilgrim EX features a soundtrack by Anamanaguchi (who composed for this game's predecessor) and an original story written by Bryan Lee O'Malley, the series' original creator. EX's developer Tribute Games is also known for its work on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvel-cosmic-invasion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="93e6f4a8-bd26-439d-84bb-14107cc17eec" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/scott-pilgrim-ex-adds-lucas-lee-and-roxie-richter-as-playable-characters]]></content:encoded>
