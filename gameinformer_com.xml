            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/Fallout/status/1975926711339409781">took to social media to announce the return of Fallout Day</a>, a livestream to celebrate their post-apocalyptic series and announce new game content in the process. The stream will take place on Thursday, October 23 (the day the bombs fell in the Fallout universe) at 10 &nbsp;PT/1 PM ET/6 PM BST.</p><p>"Tune in for the latest news about our existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events!" the announcement reads. Fans hoping for a surprise reveal of a new spin-off or the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/06/14/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-coming-after-elder-scrolls-6-shares-additional-starfield">far-off Fallout 5</a> are out of luck, but Fallout 76 players likely have news to look forward to. Just last week, <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7uCbEFtoNrbecM1hMWtY3u/fallout-76-burning-springs-first-look">Bethesda announced the newest free expansion, Burning Springs</a>, would take players to rural southeast Ohio later this year.</p><p>There's also an optimistic reading of this language that means there's potential for a remake or remaster to show up, which isn't as impossible as it might seem. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/19/leaked-microsoft-doc-indicates-xbox-is-working-on-oblivion-remaster-fallout-3">Leaked documents from the Xbox/Activision Blizzard FTC trial revealed a Fallout 3 Remaster was in the works</a>. Given that the Oblivion Remaster turned out to be real, there's a good chance Bethesda actually has a Fallout 3 Remaster in the works, though whether it's announced on Fallout Day is anyone's guess.</p><p>Last year's inaugural stream was almost entirely devoted to Fallout 76, and coincided with sales for the series' past games, Twitch drops, and a post-show led by Fallout for Hope, a charity organization supported by the Fallout community. You can get an idea of what to expect by checking out last year's show below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEIjbxhnHps"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEIjbxhnHps" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For more Fallout, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/2024/04/10/the-fallout-tv-show-is-good-season-1-review">our review of the Fallout TV series</a>, which returns for season 2 on December 17.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/08/bethesda-announces-fallout-day-stream-for-later-this-month]]></content:encoded>
