With </span></span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/"><span><span><span><span>a 91 on Metacritic</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3lkbeztsqbs2b"><span><span><span><span>two million copies sold within the first week</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> of its release, it's about as big a success as the studio could ask for.&nbsp; Yesterday, however, Variety reported the game is on its way to an even bigger audience, as it's in the works to become a feature film.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Jon M. Chu, best known for his recent work on the film adaptation of <em>Wicked</em>, would direct the movie. While Chu has never adapted a video game before, he has built his career transferring stories from other media onto the big screen, including books, cartoons, and recently, Broadway musicals. At the very least, he's been successful in directing at least one movie starring two women with magical abilities, so one can see the logic in bringing the assignment to him.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The project will also star Sydney Sweeney (</span></span><span><span>Euphoria, White Lotus, Madame Web</span></span><span><span>), though it's yet to be decided which of the leads, Mio or Zoe, she will play. Sweeney is also set to executive produce the film. Oddly, this is the second piece of Sweeney-related game adaptation news we got this week, since </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/21/sydney-sweeney-to-produce-michael-bay-directed-outrun-movie"><span><span><span><span>she'll also be producing a Michael Bay-directed adaptation of Outrun, a Sega racing series</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Story Kitchen is set to produce the film and bring the project to movie studios, as none have picked it up yet. The production company happens to have tons of other game adaptations in the works as well, including films based on Just Cause, Ruiner, Shinobi, and a live-action Tomb Raider series.</span></span></p>
