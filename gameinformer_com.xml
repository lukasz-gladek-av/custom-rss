            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's Friday – congratulations, reader, you made it to the end of the traditional work week! Here at <em>Game Informer</em>, we've been hard at work publishing stories each and every day, from previews to reviews to exclusive interviews and the daily onslaught of gaming news, to behind-the-scenes proofing and editing on the next issue of our magazine. Speaking of, it features [REDACTED] on the cover and wowsers, it's a beaut (and the story is fantastic and packed with the kind of game development details you won't find anywhere else).&nbsp;</p><p>Also, hey, this is the first This Week On GI story we've made for the site! Newsletter subscribers are familiar with our weekly round-up of stories, but fret not – this is its own thing. Now, as the Newsletter writer, I highly recommend subscribing to it because I bring a more laid-back, casual vibe to it that's not befitting of the CMS here. What I want This Week On GI to be is a post you can look forward to every Friday that not only catches you up on the latest <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping, but will also neatly organize all the stories we published this week. We know life can get busy, and you might not be able to refresh the greatest video game website ever made hourly; this article is for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, you'll find our general <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping section followed by the article round-up underneath it:&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Informer Housekeeping</h2>

<p>We've seen that many of you have already received our latest magazine issue, which features World of Warcraft: Midnight on the cover and is extra-large due to our extensive Game of the Year coverage, Editor's Top 10s, and more. If you've already received it, I hope you love and appreciate it as much as we did creating it – if you haven't yet, don't worry because it's in the mail and on the way to your mailbox.&nbsp;</p><p>We're aware of shipping hiccups that occurred in 2025 and continue to do our best to remedy any situation where someone didn't receive an issue they should have. If you missed it, the government shutdown affected postal services across the country last year, and that heavily affected our shipping processors; that's not your fault, though, and we apologize for any inconvenience or stress this may have caused you. With the World of Warcraft: Midnight issue, we're seeing that our shipping is seemingly back to normal, and people are receiving issues in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what's in the pipeline, we can't quite share what game is gracing the next edition of <em>Game Informer, </em>but trust me: you don't want to miss it. Plus, it features a massive round-up of our most anticipated games of 2026 and beyond, making it the perfect issue for those of you who like to plan out your year of gaming (like me). If you aren't already a <em>Game Informer </em>subscriber, there's still time to become one and receive this awesome issue – you can subscribe here.&nbsp;</p><h2>Story Round-Up</h2>
