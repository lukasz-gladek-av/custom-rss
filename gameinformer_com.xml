            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>School-life tactics RPG Demonschool will open for enrollment quite soon. Developer Necrosoft Games and publisher Ysbryd Games announced today that Demonschool will arrive on September 3, 2025 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and PC through both Steam and Epic.</p><p>Shown during today's Nintendo Indie World Japan showcase, Demonschool follows college freshman Faye, born into a line of demon hunters, through quite an eventful semester. As creepy, spooky, and scary events transpire around her school life, she'll have to team up with newfound friends to combat the looming demonic threat.</p><p>She's got no shortage of friends though, as Necrosoft Games says there are 15 playable characters, alongside side quests to pursue, social links to cultivate, and combos to develop. Some easy comparisons could be drawn to both Shin Megami Tensei and its sister series Persona, and true sickos might even detect the faint aroma of the dual-screen duology Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Demonschool was originally planned to launch a while ago, but <a href="https://necrosoftgames.com/demonschool-in-2025/">several delays</a> have pushed it to where it is now, as the team worked to realize their vision for this demonic tactics RPG. Still, it's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/07/the-coolest-games-weve-played-at-summer-game-fest-2025">managed to impress</a> through the various demos Necrosoft Games has shown over the years.</p><p>“At long last, Demonschool<em> </em>is finally coming out. It's been a long road but we're through certification and ready to go,” said Brandon Sheffield, Necrosoft's creative director, in a press release. “We really put a lot of ourselves into this thing and now the future of Demonschool&nbsp;is in your hands. We truly hope you will enjoy it."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/07/tactical-rpg-demonschool-will-officially-open-its-doors-in-september]]></content:encoded>
