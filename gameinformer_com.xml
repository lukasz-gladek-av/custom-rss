            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Sharkmob has announced it will be shutting down the servers for its 2022 free-to-play battle royal <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/06/10/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-preview-battle-royale-meets-vampires-no-seriously">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt</a> next year. This will render the game completely unplayable.</p><p>Bloodhunt will be taken offline on April 28, 2026. Sharkmob explains in a <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026">blog post</a> that this decision was made due to the game’s player count dropping below a sustainable amount. &nbsp;</p><p>"When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did," Sharkmob writes. "From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways.&nbsp;</p><p>During these past 4 years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable."</p>
