Now, a Koei Tecmo studio head has pulled back the curtains on what players can expect from the narrative of this game, revealing Age of Imprisonment will show how the people of Hyrule defeated Ganondorf before the events of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p>In a new Creator’s Voice behind-the-scenes video for Age of Imprisonment called “Beyond the Legend,” Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita and Koei Tecmo triple-A games studio head Yosuke Hayashi discuss the upcoming game, what’s to unfold in the story, and how the Switch 2 makes it possible. Hayashi reveals Age of Imprisonment shows the full story of the Imprisoning War, which is only seen in fragmented chunks in Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“This game takes place during the Imprisoning War, which is shown in fragments in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,” he says. “In this Hyrule Warriors game, you’ll see how the people contended with the threat of the original Ganondorf.”</p><p>Matsushita picks up this thread, stating, “As a story that you can only fully experience here, it doesn’t just depict the battles of the Imprisoning War via a Warriors game; it also shows the kingdom of Hyrule after Princess Zelda is sent back in time. You’ll also get to know the four masked sages from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the video, Matsushita and Hayashi discuss how the Switch 2 makes Age of Imprisonment possible. They explain that the console's power allows the game to feature more enemies on screen and maintain a high and stable frame rate (which looks like 60 FPS in the video).</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment hits Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this Winter.</p><p>In the meantime, read about how <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/nintendo-has-a-plan-for-continuous-flow-of-switch-2-through-the-holidays">Nintendo has a plan for “continuous flow” of Switch 2 through the holidays</a>, and then check out the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-free-resolution-framerate-and-hdr-updates-for-select-switch-games-on">Switch games getting free updates on Switch 2</a>.

However, it’s clear season two will leave us with a lot of story left when it’s over. While many fans predicted that a third season, which has already been greenlit, could finish the story, showrunner Craig Mazin alludes to needing a fourth season to wrap up the events of The Last of Us Part II.</p><p>In a new interview with <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/"><em>Collider</em></a>, Mazin explains, “there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season” when asked about a theoretical fourth season.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span><strong>Spoilers For Season Two Of HBO's The Last Of Us</strong></span></p><hr><p>“I think there’s a decent chance Season 3 will be longer than Season 2, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different,” Mazin, who is also a director and writer on the show, told <em>Collider</em>. “The thing about Joel’s death is that it’s so impactful. It’s such a narrative nuclear bomb that it’s hard to wander away from it. We can’t really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story.</p><p>“I’m not sure that will be necessarily true for Season 3. I think we’ll have a little more room there. But certainly, there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we’ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That’s the likely outcome.”</p><p>Though it seems like Mazin and the team behind the show are still waiting to see if a fourth season will be greenlit, which likely depends on the reception of season three, it’s clear he believes a fourth season is needed to finish the story of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">The Last of Us Part II</a>. It also sounds like we can expect a Bill and Frank-style episode in season three.</p><p>Regardless, this theoretical fourth season is years away.
