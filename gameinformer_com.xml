Released during today's Future Games Show: Summer Showcase 2025, this trailer gave us another look at this narrative-focused horror experience's first-person gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>"In the last known city on Earth, people are disappearing in their sleep," the game's description reads. "Those who remain exist in a crisis of reckless experiments to keep awake. Katja must navigate depraved death cults, otherworldly forces, and the ever-present horror of The Hush, to save herself and those who rely upon her."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Sleep Awake gameplay trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6txum7vHznA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6txum7vHznA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Notably, Blumhouse Games, the video game arm of horror movie production company Blumhouse, is publishing the game. It also published last year's indie horror, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/fear-the-spotlight">Fear the Spotlight</a>. Sleep Awake blends 3D gameplay with live-action FMV elements alongside a "brain-melting industrial soundscape," courtesy of Finck.&nbsp;</p><p>Sleep Awake is due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p>
