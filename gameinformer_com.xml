            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Even though developer CD Projekt Red promised that last year's Update 2.2 would be its last big update for the game, it seems the team just can't escape Night City. That's because Update 2.3 is on the way, arriving tomorrow, and features new quests, vehicles, Photo Mode additions, PC tech improvements, VRR on consoles, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 2.3 is the last big update, says CD Projekt Red (we believe them this time, considering Cyberpunk 2 has moved into pre-production as of May), and hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow. Switch 2 players running through Night City via Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will have to wait for a "later date" to receive the Update 2.3 additions, however.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This patch introduces 4 new vehicles, the AutoDrive feature, self-driving Delamain cabs, and more," the <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">patch notes</a> read. "It also contains update for CrystalCoat and Photo Mode, as well as support for AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR10+ gaming on PC, among others."</p><p>Update 2.3 also brings Cyberpunk 2077 to Mac computers running on Apple Silicon. You can purchase the game via the Mac App Store and the other usual PC storefronts. If you already own it on GOG, Steam, or the Epic Games Store, you're set to play the game on Mac&nbsp;</p><h3>Here's the full Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3 Patch Notes:&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p><p>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p><ul><li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong><ul><li>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Hunt</em> and <em>The Beast In Me</em>).</li><li>An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong><ul><li>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Beast in Me: Badlands</em>, <em>The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo</em>, <em>Transmission, </em>and <em>Search and Destroy</em>).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong><ul><li>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete <em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...</em>).</li><li>If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong><ul><li>Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Introducing AutoDrive!</strong> This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map).
