I'll be doing individual write-ups for a lot of these games, but I'll also be writing condensed quick-hit thoughts on the coolest games I've played so far, and you can read them right here (so bookmark this page, folks!).&nbsp;</p><p>Below, you'll find a running list of the games I've played during Gamescom 2025. They'll be listed in reverse-chronological order, so the latest game I've played will be at the top and the first game I played will be at the very bottom!</p><h3>Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>

<p>It's real, y'all. Hollow Knight: Silksong exists and is playable, and I checked out the game's very first level, Moss Grotto. After a brief cutscene that shows Hornet trapped in a Cinderella-like carriage (that she then breaks out of), I take control. Immediately, Hornet is much faster than the first game's protagonist, both as she platforms around and with her attacks. She has a new ability called Bind (used by pressing B on an Xbox controller) that heals her. However, you can't spam this ability as it requires using a bar on screen that must be full.&nbsp;</p><p>It recharges over time and by defeating enemies, and I found it pretty easy to get it full for another Bind. Platforming around Moss Grotto feels a lot like 2017's Hollow Knight, though Hornet is more nimble and can mantle up cliffs and platforms. The enemies here are easy to defeat, and it's not until I fight the demo's boss, Moss Mother, that I'm challenged. It's a fun fight, but still mostly easy.&nbsp;</p><p>With the demo and my hands-on time with Silksong behind me, I'm excited to see what else awaits me in the full game. If this first level is any indication, it's going to be a great Metroidvania, much like the first game. That said, I'm not convinced it's going to break through the hype and make a mark on the genre like the first game did. I'm also not convinced it needs to, though.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/we-played-the-first-level-of-hollow-knight-silksong-heres-what-we-think">read my full Hollow Knight: Silksong hands-on thoughts here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/the-most-dope-games-weve-played-during-gamescom-2025]]></content:encoded>
