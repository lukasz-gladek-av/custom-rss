            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>While Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon games (the series is so large that it's hard to see how it wouldn't be), it does develop other games from time to time. That said, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/pokemon-developer-game-freak-announces-beast-of-reincarnation-for" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3606a6f8-a353-44c5-bc83-19ef23e07cc0" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Beast of Reincarnation, the studio's upcoming post-apocalyptic action role-playing game</a>, is a big swing even by the studio's standards. After seeing the game in action during today's Xbox Developer Direct, we got a much clearer vision of what to expect when it launches this summer.</p><p>Set in Japan in the year 4026, Game Freak describes the game as a "one-person one-dog action RPG." The person and dog in question are named Emma and Koo, respectively, and they live in a time where the human population has been decimated by a parasitic plant called "blight." Somehow, Emma is able to seal that blight within her body, so she's known as a Sealer. Unfortunately, this is an ability people fear, causing her to live in isolation from the remains of society.</p>

<p>After forming a bond with Koo, a magical white dog with a tail made of vines and branches, Emma is told (by the a hologram of perhaps the most cyberpunk-looking guy of all time) to defeat the titular beast of reincarnation to save the Capital. To do so, she'll have to defeat "malefacts," corrupt fusions of animals and blight. I assume "malefact" is pronounced less like "male fact" more like "artifact," but given that the word was only provided in the Japanese speakers' subtitles, this is just a guess. Extremely powerful malefacts, known as Nushi, are the bosses of this world. They can create blighted forests full of enemies and obstacles players will have to overcome before facing off against the deadly beasts.</p><p>Emma is particularly suited to this task thanks to her ability to absorb and dispel blight, but also because of her trusty sword, magic abilities, and vinelike hair. Her sword is her main weapon in combat, and can be upgraded with spirit stones to get special effects when she parries. She and Koo can also use Blooming Arts, powerful magic moves that slow time and allow them to harm or hinder foes. Each character also has a skill tree, and the abilities from one character impacts the other's; the developers also hint that the two will unlock more powers as their bond deepens. Finally, Emma's hair can be used in various ways for platforming, like as a bridge that extends forward over gaps or as a long stilt-like extension of Emma's leg.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo will also have to face golems – robots with corrupted human souls – and meet other human characters, like Brad, Kagura, and the mysterious swordswoman Kunai. The dystopian elements are a bit on the nose, but game looks beautiful, especially for a studio that's been criticized for the poor technical performance of recent Pokémon games. It helps that this game, at the time of writing, is not coming to Switch or Switch 2, and is instead launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. We're excited to check it out when it hits shelves this summer.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/pokemon-developers-beast-of-reincarnation-a-post-apocalyptic]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 6 Gets First Gameplay Details And May Launch Date]]></title>
            <link>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-gets-first-gameplay-details-and-may-launch-date</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct kicked off with the first look at gameplay for Forza Horizon 6. We got a look at the game’s cover cars, a breakdown of new customization features, and, of course, a glimpse into how much fun driving across the game’s rendition of Japan could be.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign sees players begin as a tourist who joins the Horizon festival and climb the ranks, a departure from previous entries where the player is already a relative superstar. You’ll still progress via the established wristband system, but Horizon 6 introduces a new method of progression called the Collection Journal. The Collection Journal is inspired by Japanese stamp collecting and lets players build a digital collection of mementos discovered while exploring. Players can take photos of murals, landmarks, and other scenic sights to save to the journal as well.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/XG1Ll2CVhug?si=UxhcYwsW7n4nhXCE" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XG1Ll2CVhug" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Japan is the series’ biggest map yet. Tokyo alone is the largest city in the series, featuring multiple districts for players to cruise through and recognizable sights, such as Shibuya Crossing, Tokyo Tower, and Ginko Avenue. Playground Games is also striving to accurately represent topographical details, from various countryside to mountains and city streets, to add as much authenticity to the experience as possible. Seasons also return, shifting the environment from winter to spring and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Japanese car culture will be represented in a major way. Cars have no customization options and a fully overhauled roster for improved balancing. More cars will be available at launch than ever before, and new aftermarket cars include rare or unique vehicles to unlock at a bargain. Playground also revealed Forza Horizon 6’s cover cars: the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can now build custom structures from any location, and building is now fully multiplayer, allowing friends to concoct creations together. In addition to unlocking player houses for vehicle storage and fast travel, you’ll also unlock a new destination called The Estate. This giant plot of land gives players a blank canvas to build what they want. What begins as a rural section of land can be transformed into mountain hideaways, your own personal race track, a factory complex, and more, based on items purchased using in-game currency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another new feature is Car Meets, inspired by the real-world Daikoku car meet. This social space is always available to join, and it lets players meet up, share custom paint jobs and designs, and purchase their own versions of cars they like.&nbsp;</p><p>New driving features include Auto-drive and proximity radar. In terms of accessibility options, Forza Horizon 6 features a customizable high-contrast mode to help make the game easier to play for the visually impaired.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends with a tantalizing tease of a pair of giant robotic feet stepping behind a vehicle that looked suspiciously like a Gundam. Given Forza Horizon’s penchant for crossover content, odds are we’ll be piloting a mobile suit, which is the perfect fit given the setting.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During Xbox's Developer Direct today, Double Fine took a surprise spot on the virtual stage to announce its charming new pottery party game, Kiln.</p><p>Developed as part of Double Fine's internal game jam Amnesia Fortnight, Kiln is a multiplayer party brawler where you build pots and destroy them. Per today's Xbox Developer Direct, the drive behind Kiln is allowing players to build creatively, and then letting them destroy each other's creations. The Quench mode, for example, tasks players with picking up &nbsp;and carrying water to their enemies' kiln, with the goal of dousing it for the win. It's reminiscent of a MOBA in some ways, or Splatoon, or maybe just multiplayer objective-based games in general.&nbsp;</p><p>There are tons of options for shaping and sculpting your pottery, with detection tools for identifying specific shapes like bowls or cups. Once they enter the arena, they can run, jump, and attack, and each shape also has different special attacks all their own. Plates can fling a pie, for example. Maps range from dance floors to ancient history, with different lanes and avenues. Some paths might only be accessible for specific shapes, giving a small advantage to the little cups.</p><p>Kiln is set to arrive in spring 2026 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Double Fine plans to host a beta ahead of that launch, with specific details yet to be announced. If you want to sign up for the beta, <a href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/sign-up-for-the-kiln-beta">you can do so at Double Fine's site here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-developer-direct/2026/01/22/double-fine-announces-online-multiplayer-pottery-brawler-kiln]]></content:encoded>
