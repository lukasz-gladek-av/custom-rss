Season 1, which introduces a new champion and extended progression, will coincide with that launch across all platforms. During this time, players will gain access to unlocked content, including champions, skins, mastery rewards, and more, regardless of which platform you play on, with a catch-up mechanic to help console players earn content from the PC early access period.&nbsp;</p>
