However, it’s clear season two will leave us with a lot of story left when it’s over. While many fans predicted a third season, which has already been greenlit, could finish the story, showrunner Craig Mazin alludes to needing a fourth season to wrap up the events of The Last of Us Part II.</p><p>In a new interview with <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/"><em>Collider</em></a>, Mazin explains, “there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season” when asked about a theoretical fourth season.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span><strong>Spoilers For Season Two Of HBO's The Last Of Us</strong></span></p><hr><p>“I think there’s a decent chance Season 3 will be longer than Season 2, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different,” Mazin, who is also a director and writer on the show, told <em>Collider</em>. “The thing about Joel’s death is that it’s so impactful. It’s such a narrative nuclear bomb that it’s hard to wander away from it. We can’t really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story.</p><p>“I’m not sure that will be necessarily true for Season 3. I think we’ll have a little more room there. But certainly, there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we’ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That’s the likely outcome.”</p><p>Though it seems like Mazin and the team behind the show are still waiting to see if a fourth season will be greenlit, which likely depends on the reception of season three, it’s clear he believes a fourth season is needed to finish the story of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">The Last of Us Part II</a>. It also sounds like we can expect a Bill and Frank-style episode in season three.</p><p>Regardless, this theoretical fourth season is years away.
