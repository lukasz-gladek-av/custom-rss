The black shoe is adorned with the Xbox face buttons, d-pad, the white Xbox button, and even pairs of analog sticks. The interior of the shoe sports the Xbox brand name with the Xbox logo adorning the heel straps. The shoe also comes with a limited-edition five-piece Jibbitz charm pack inspired by series such as Halo, Fallout, Doom, and Sea of Thieves.&nbsp;</p><p>You can purchase the shoe beginning tomorrow, November 25, from the Crocs <a href="https://www.crocs.com/p/xbox-classic-clog/211439.html?cgid=xbox&amp;cid=001">website</a> for $80.&nbsp;</p><p>To read more recent Xbox news, check out some of these announcements from last week's Xbox Partner Preview for games such as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/new-gameplay-trailer-for-arthurian-action-game-tides-of">Tides of Annihilation</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/20/reanimal-the-next-game-from-the-little-nightmares-team-drops-in-february">Reanimal</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-is-the-next-game-from-the-vampire-survivors-team">Vampire Crawlers</a>, the next game from the creator of Vampire Survivors.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2025/11/24/crocs-and-xbox-partner-for-a-controller-inspired-shoe-thats-available]]></content:encoded>

Now re-christened as Wild Blue Skies, the upcoming retro throwback has over four minutes of new gameplay footage.</p><p>Wild Blue Skies was first revealed in March, and this homage to Star Fox has some authentic expertise behind it; Giles Goddard, a former Nintendo programmer who worked on the original Star Fox, leads the development team at the Kyoto-based Chuhai Labs. &nbsp;The gameplay trailer, revealed by <em>IGN</em>, shows off an unedited dogfighting sequence through the ancient ruins of a stormy planet.&nbsp;</p><p>Wild Blue Skies centers on ace pilot Bowie Stray and his team taking on the forces of the evil Grimclaw. The flight combat, along with the comms chatter of your dorky anthromorphic animal comrades, certainly captures the spirit of Nintendo’s oft-neglected rail shooter.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Wild Blue Skies is currently confirmed for PC only, but it does not have a release window.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/24/star-fox-inspired-wild-blue-skies-formerly-wild-blue-gets-extended-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

There's plenty of Reimagined content to read here, but I also took this opportunity to ask Horii about the secret sauce behind Dragon Quest.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Horii, it's two things: warmth and ease of access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The key concept that I really try to prioritize, or keep important to me, for Dragon Quest is that, you know, older computer games didn't really have a sense of warmth," Horii says on the games he played preceding his work creating Dragon Quest. "But [warmth] was something that I really wanted to bring for the Dragon Quest titles. That, and accessibility for the players."&nbsp;</p><p>Horii tells me that when developing Dragon Quest, he specifically wanted to launch it on the Nintendo Famicom, recognizing its ease of access for players compared to home computers, which still carried a hefty price tag comparatively.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think [warmth and accessibility] are pretty important in terms of what makes Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest," he continues. "But one thing that I also have in mind, one potential reason why it's been beloved for so long, for almost 40 years, is that the Dragon Quest series also serves as a sort of communication tool for players. A lot of people might have memories of playing the Dragon Quest games with friends; they might have a memory of playing the game with their older brother [...] who they might ask to play the game on their behalf so that they can grind and skip the [leveling process challenges].</p><p>"So I think that for a lot of people, Dragon Quest games just have a special place in their heart, and that's why it's been so successful for so long."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seated beside Horii during this interview was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/05/who-is-takeshi-ichikawa-the-producer-of-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa</a>. In my time playing it so far, Reimagined retains the warmth of the original island-hopping Dragon Quest VII adventure, and the new visual aesthetic lends itself well to those feelings. That's one of the bigger takeaways from my preview: it's cozy, warm, and invites adventure. I asked Ichikawa the same question I posed to Horii, curious about his takeaway.</p><p>"I think all the RPG elements the series has to offer are the biggest strength of the Dragon Quest series, and I like to call it part of the Horii-esque elements," he says. "All the humor, the jokes in the narrative, the dialogue, and the expressions and the portrayals; It's just so adorable at times, and when you look at the story, it's an epic story but also somehow feels relevant to you at the time."&nbsp;</p><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p><hr><p><em>What do you think the secret sauce of Dragon Quest is?
