For Hire</a> evokes the classic cartoons of the 1930s in its rubberhose animation style, but it’s a first-person shooter at its core. That means it’s all about the guns, of which we’ve largely only seen era-specific firearms like Tommy guns and pistols. A new trailer reveals three more off-the-wall weapons that lean much more into the absurdity of Mouse’s cartoon world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First up is a freeze weapon called the COOL-D Cold Steam Applier, which can encase foes in ice, which you can shatter with a stiff kick. The CLEAN-D Automatic Turpentine Cleanse is a chemical weapon firing Turpentine that melts foes on contact. Lastly, you can scramble enemy brains with the MIND-D Self-Aware Attitude Changer. This mind-warping beam causes the target to go insane to the point that their head explodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First revealed in 2023, Mouse: P.I. For Hire stars Jack Pepper, a detective and war hero who becomes embroiled in a mystery within the criminal underworld of the city of Mouseberg. The Noir-inspired adventure lets players blast through non-linear levels using a variety of ranged and melee weapons and power-ups, like a Popeye-inspired spinach boost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire launches this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

<p>As a member of the Black Spider Clan, Kumori combines modern weaponry with demonic power to take down threats. She most prominently wields twin daggers to slice apart foes up close, but she can also toss them to hold back distant threats. See Kumori in action in the game’s new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was announced last December during The Game Awards and is being helmed by Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen and published by Dotemu (TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4). Ragebound canonically takes place immediately after the conclusion of the original Ninja Gaiden for NES. Ryu Hayabusa has left his village to avenge his father, leaving a new playable hero and upstart Hayabusa Clan ninja, Kenji Mozu, to protect his home from a demonic threat.</p>

<p>The 2D action features optional side quests, upgradable abilities, and secret collectibles. Naturally, it will also sport the series' signature (or infamous) precision-based, skill-demanding platforming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound launches this summer for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be the second of three Ninja Gaiden releases in 2025, following Ninja Gaiden II Black in January and before the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4 later this year.&nbsp;</p>
