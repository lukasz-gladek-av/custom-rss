Today, you can play <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-announced">the enhanced edition of Little Nightmares</a>, which gives a graphical boost to the 2017 puzzle platformer as well as Brews &amp; Bastards, a twin-stick dungeon crawler starring a cast of drunken heroes.</p><p>Tomorrow, Game Pass Premium subscribers will also gain access to a handful of titles that were previously locked to the Ultimate tier, including Atomfall, Lost in Random, Rematch, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition. The following week introduces some more heavy hitters: Star Wars Outlaws makes its debut exclusively for Ultimate subscribers, while Resident Evil Village becomes available to Premium members a few weeks before its sequel drops.
