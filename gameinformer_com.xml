This new tale&nbsp;sees Kay Vess and Nix team up with pirate Hondo Ohnaka (who fans may remember from the <em>Clone Wars</em> animated show) to plunder the riches of the Khepi Tomb.</p>

<p>However, they’ll have to take on Stinger Tash and her Rokana Raiders. Kay also meets the Miyuki Trade League, who tasks Kay with smuggling goods in exchange for new rewards for the <em>Trailblazer</em>. To access the DLC, players will need to have completed the main story campaign. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Pirate’s Bay will be automatically available to Season Pass owners and can be purchased standalone. Ubisoft has not listed the à la carte price for the DLC, but the previous story expansion, Wild Card, cost $14.99, so we imagine this is similarly priced. Additionally, a title update arriving alongside A Pirate’s Bay will give all players free cosmetic items inspired by the Disney Plus series <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em>. You can find these items in the delivery crate inside the <em>Trailblazer</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, a free three-hour demo of the game is now available. We also learned that the Switch 2 version of Star Wars Outlaws launches on September 4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced that the new U.S. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2">pre-order</a> date for the Nintendo Switch 2 will be April 24. Pre-orders were initially scheduled for April 9 before Nintendo <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">delayed this</a> due to the changing economic environment caused by the United States' tariffs. The company also details where prices for the console and its accessories now stand.</p>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/">website</a> confirms the console prices will remain unchanged.
