            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Pokémon Company has announced that it will hold a Pokémon Presents next week on Friday, February 27, at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET. As in prior years, a Pokémon Presents is happening on the specific day of February 27 because it's Pokémon Day, which marks the release of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>This year's Pokémon Day marks 30 years of Pokémon, a big milestone for the series that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/psa/2026/02/04/pokemon-to-celebrate-30th-anniversary-with-super-bowl-commercial-special-merch-tcg">The Pokémon Company is celebrating with Super Bowl ads, merchandise</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/20/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-are-coming-to-switch-switch-2-digitally-next-week">the release of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2</a> consoles next week. The Pokémon Company says this year's Pokémon Presents video presentation will feature "exciting updates and announcements across the Pokémon franchise." Previous Pokémon Presents have included updates to mobile games, reveals of spinoffs, and even the announcement of brand new generations (here's hoping we see Gen 10).&nbsp;</p>

You would assume an announcement like this would be saved for the Pokémon Presents happening next Friday as a shadow-drop that fans who watch these kinds of showcases enjoy, but alas, maybe The Pokémon Company needs more time for something else (maybe a Gen 10 reveal?) during the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen announcement trailer for Switch and Switch 2 below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p url="https://youtu.be/k8c_C4vfUMo?si=bmJMsbfVvxw-1WDi" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8c_C4vfUMo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Originally launched on the Game Boy Advance system in 2004, Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version will be coming to the Nintendo Switch system as download-exclusive titles to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon," a press release reads. "These titles will be available to play after the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents presentation and can be played on both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 systems."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That Pokémon Presents presentation will air on Friday, February 27, at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the meantime, check out some additional images from the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen below:&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/the-struggles-of-evolution">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review</a>, and then read <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a/maintaining-rank">Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a> after that.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to hop back into the Kanto region next week?
