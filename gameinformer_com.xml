            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie’s Marathon has a new release window after it was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/marathon-delayed-indefinitely-from-september-release">pushed out</a> of its original September 23 launch date. The upcoming multiplayer extraction shooter will now be released in March, and Bungie has shared a new documentary sharing its updated vision for the game</p><p>Among other things, the near-23-minute documentary discusses how Bungie is “doubling down” on the Marathon's dark, grounded sci-fi world. The game centers on players controlling bio-cybernetic characters called Runners exploring and scavenging the lost colony of Tau Ceti IV. Runners accomplish this by transferring their consciousness into Shells, high-tech bodies sporting unique capabilities.</p><p>The video dives into the new features added to the PvPvE experience since the playable alpha, such as proximity chat, solo queue, and a new Runner shell called Rook. We also get a look at Marathon’s four maps, its copious amount of loot, the various factions players will perform jobs for, and a showcase of the game’s improved visual fidelity, audio, and environmental storytelling.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to sharing the March launch window. Bungie states that the game will be priced at $39.99. Owners will be treated to free gameplay updates throughout the first year, including new maps, new Runner shells, live events, and more. This will kick off with the Season 1 exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive.&nbsp;</p><p>Bungie also shares that Marathon’s Reward Pass – essentially a battle pass – does not expire, and you can also purchase and unlock prior passes. Bungie hopes this will eliminate the FOMO that players can feel by not logging in regularly. The studio promises that Marathon will never devolve into a “pay-to-win” experience. “We believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” reads the team’s <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">blog post.</a></p><p>It seems Bungie is taking players' concerns to heart, but it remains to be seen if Marathon can right the ship after some shaky first impressions. First revealed in May 2023, the game now faces some stiff competition in the form of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/arc-raiders/consequential-and-worthwhile-multiplayer">Arc Raiders</a>, a similarly designed extraction shooter that launched on October 30 to a glowing reception from critics and fans. Marathon has also been a subject of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">controversy surrounding plagiarized art assets</a> that appeared in the game. Earlier this month, it was reported that the issue <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">had been resolved</a>.&nbsp;Here's hoping Marathon is back on track on the road to its launch next spring.&nbsp;</p><p>Marathon launches in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/marathon-launches-next-march-as-bungie-shares-an-updated-look-at-the-game-in-action]]></content:encoded>
