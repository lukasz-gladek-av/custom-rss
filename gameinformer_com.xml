As in previous years, it will be a double feature with a presentation dedicated to The Outer Worlds 2 airing immediately afterward.</p>

<p>The Xbox Showcase occurs during the week of Summer Game Fest and begins at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. Like previous years, the event is a digital-only showcase, meaning it's pre-taped instead of being a live event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with the Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Directs the last two years, The Outer Worlds 2 Direct promises to reveal new gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG with an inside look at Obsidian Games and insights from its developers. The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-announcement-trailer-left-us-smiling">announced</a> in 2021, but got its first gameplay reveal during The Game Awards last December.</p>
