            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/the-gta-like-mindseye-gets-new-story-trailer-and-june-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>MindsEye, the Grand Theft Auto-esque story-driven action game led by former Rockstar Games producer Leslie Benzies, is arriving on June 10. Developed by Build A Rocket Boy Games, a new story trailer shows off the game’s setting, Redrock City, and provides a glimpse into the story and antagonists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redrock City, a fictional desert metropolis ruled by AI, consumer-grade robots, and other cutting-edge technology, is the stage for protagonist Jacob Diaz. He’s a former soldier carrying the MindsEye, a neural implant plaguing him with mysterious memories from a life-changing mission. His fight to find the truth pits him against both the government and Big Tech, namely Redrock mayor Shiva Vega, who may be a little too eager to establish complete control in her city, and Marco Silva, an eccentric tech CEO with big plans for altering the course of human evolution. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MindsEye first became known as part of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/heres-the-first-look-at-everywhere-led-by-ex-rockstar-producer-leslie">Everywhere</a>, Build A Rocket Boy’s yet-to-be-released game-making platform first announced in 2022. Last October, the studio announced a publishing partnership with IOI Partners, the publishing arm of Hitman developer IO Interactive, for MindsEye. The title was formally revealed during the PlayStation State of Play in February.</p>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy tells <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-new-thriller-from-former-gta-producer-and-hitman-publisher-gets-release-date">Eurogamer</a></em> that while MindsEye can be accessed through Everywhere, it will be available as a standalone title. You can purchase it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC for $59.99.</p>
