Even before his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/deadpool-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e812bb87-8a14-4388-8593-2fab410b2edf" data-entity-substitution="canonical">official reveal at the Game Awards this year</a>, it was only a matter of time before one of Marvel's most popular characters made his way to massive hero shooter. The question lied in how the developers at NetEase would adapt the character's signature swords, pistols, and meta humor into a game setting. And once that's done, which of the game's three roles the developers they assign him? According to today's reveal trailer, it'll actually be all of them.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That's right – Deadpool can be a Duelist, Strategist, or Vanguard depending on the player's choice. His appearance remains unchanged, but his max health and moveset will fit the role. Duelist Deadpool can throw his sword to rotate like a razor blade, Vanguard Deadpool gets a deployable, spherical shield, and Strategist Deadpool heals allies by shooting them or slashing them with his katanas. It wouldn't make sense for any other character, but for Deadpool, it just feels right.</p><p>Even outside of the role-swapping, the merc with a mouth's abilities are unique, to say the least. As he fights his foes, he'll be able to level up his skills, opening up an in-game book-like menu to select what to unlock. He also has a move that deal damage to enemy players when they miss shots, as well as the ability to take photos with people he defeats. In the reveal trailer, we even see Deadpool using that photo mode to become invincible, absorbing Magneto's Ultimate Ability with his butt.</p>

      <p>Deadpool's level up screen in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>As per usual, season six also brings other improvements to Marvel Rivals. A new map, Museum of Contemplation, frops January 29. Times Square, the combat-free lobby, is adding a photo mode and The Clobberin' Club, where players can duel and broadcast their match on one of the street's giant screens. Hero proficiency is also getting an overhaul. The small handful of tiers has been fully revamped to include more hero-specific rewards, including in-game currency and animated character avatars.</p><p>Finally, more team-ups are coming, while others are phased out. Peni will lose her team-up with Rocket, and Spider-Man will lose his team-up with Human Torch. However, Peni and Spider-Man are getting a new team-up (which grants Spider-Man a web bomb), and Jeff is getting a team-up with Deadpool, which creates a spinning toy that heals allies and covers enemies' screens with animated Deadpools. You can see the full list of updates in the video below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For more Marvel Rivals, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/30/gender-swapped-lady-loki-skin-comes-to-marvel-rivals-for-the-month-of-january">the limited-time Lady Loki skin</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/marvel-rivals/a-super-shooter">our review from last year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/deadpool-officially-joins-marvel-rivals-season-6-as-a-duelist-and-a-strategist-and-a]]></content:encoded>
