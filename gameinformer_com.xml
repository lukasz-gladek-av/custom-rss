            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>You can turn any genre into a roguelike these days, and Ball x Pit is the latest exciting example. This fantasy block-breaker has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ballxpit.com/post/3m3v7hizftk2q">already sold 400,000 copies since its release on October 15</a>, which includes sales on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC, but not Switch 2. Nintendo's recently released console would get the game at a later date, but it turns out it wasn't that much later – the upgrade will be available tomorrow, October 28.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ballxpit.com/post/3m46m3rnkvs2x">According to the Ball x Pit social media accounts</a>, the Switch 2 version will have enhanced resolution and an improved frame rate. More specifically, it will run "1080p and 60 fps (or more) in handheld mode." Owners of the Switch 1 version can upgrade to the Switch 2 version as well, so there's no need to buy the game a second time. In fact, the announcement also asserts that the Switch 2 upgrade will be free for people who own the game on Switch, so it should be as simple as opening up the eShop to download the newer version.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18pHUtXzF2w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/18pHUtXzF2w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Inspired by classic block-breaking game Arkanoid, Ball x Pit has players bounce various powered balls against armies of block-shaped fantasy enemies. We greatly enjoyed it, with our editor-in-chief Matt Miller <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ball-x-pit/breathtaking-brick-breaking">scoring it an 8.75</a> and saying, "It’s one of those surprise successes of a game that is easy to recommend to almost anyone for some simple fun, following in the footsteps of titles like Vampire Survivors to present a perfect zone-out and focus-in experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/27/ball-x-pit-breaks-out-a-free-switch-2-update-tomorrow-october-28]]></content:encoded>
