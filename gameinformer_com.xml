Considering it’s coming from the mind behind Katamari Damacy, expect some fun hijinks. Plus, your save data transfers over to the final game.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nD9H6__29A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nD9H6__29A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“A charming, colorful adventure game from the creator of Katamari Damacy and the uvula team about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion,” the game’s Steam description reads. “While their body is stuck in a T-pose, they do their best to make the most of it.”</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727290/to_a_T_Demo/">Steam page</a> also details what to expect of the full game, including an episodic story that unfolds over multiple days, plenty of minigames, a cute town to explore, and unique character customization.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/20/stellar-blade-developer-plans-to-release-a-sequel-before-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Korean developer ShiftUp released <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> last year, and it quickly became a hit. In roughly one year, it has brought in more than $48 million of revenue for the developer, so it won’t be a surprise that the team is working on a follow-up game. However, according to a <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">Q1 2025 fiscal year presentation</a> from ShiftUp, the developer plans to have a sequel before 2027.</p><p>In the presentation, which is where ShiftUp reveals Stellar Blade has brought in 68.1 billion KRW (or $48 million), there’s a slide titled, “IP expansion on its way with high visibility.” We can see the 2024 release of Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5, additional strategy for ShiftUp’s mobile gacha game, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, and “Platform Expansion” for Stellar Blade. This likely alludes to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-hits-pc-next-month-pc-specs-and-features-revealed">the upcoming PC release</a>. However, beyond that, the slide also shows “Sequel” for Stellar Blade before the year 2027, which is represented as the cutoff for the slide’s timeline.</p>

<p>Though there aren’t any accompanying details, given the reception to Stellar Blade, it makes sense ShiftUp is planning a sequel for the action game.</p><p>Elsewhere on the slide, there’s mention of something called "Project Witches," which gets its own color and is separate from Nikke and Stellar Blade, as it’s likely a new IP.</p><p>While waiting for a Stellar Blade sequel, potentially next year, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/stellar-blade/more-than-a-pretty-face"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Stellar Blade review</a>.

Now, a Koei Tecmo studio head has pulled back the curtains on what players can expect from the narrative of this game, revealing Age of Imprisonment will show how the people of Hyrule defeated Ganondorf before the events of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p>In a new Creator’s Voice behind-the-scenes video for Age of Imprisonment called “Beyond the Legend,” Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita and Koei Tecmo triple-A games studio head Yosuke Hayashi discuss the upcoming game, what’s to unfold in the story, and how the Switch 2 makes it possible. Hayashi reveals Age of Imprisonment shows the full story of the Imprisoning War, which is only seen in fragmented chunks in Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“This game takes place during the Imprisoning War, which is shown in fragments in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,” he says. “In this Hyrule Warriors game, you’ll see how the people contended with the threat of the original Ganondorf.”</p><p>Matsushita picks up this thread, stating, “As a story that you can only fully experience here, it doesn’t just depict the battles of the Imprisoning War via a Warriors game; it also shows the kingdom of Hyrule after Princess Zelda is sent back in time. You’ll also get to know the four masked sages from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the video, Matsushita and Hayashi discuss how the Switch 2 makes Age of Imprisonment possible. They explain that the console's power allows the game to feature more enemies on screen and maintain a high and stable frame rate (which looks like 60 FPS in the video).</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment hits Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this winter.</p><p>In the meantime, read about how <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/nintendo-has-a-plan-for-continuous-flow-of-switch-2-through-the-holidays">Nintendo has a plan for “continuous flow” of Switch 2 through the holidays</a>, and then check out the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-free-resolution-framerate-and-hdr-updates-for-select-switch-games-on">Switch games getting free updates on Switch 2</a>.
