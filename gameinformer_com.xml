            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema have released the first official trailer for their upcoming sequel, <em>Mortal Kombat II</em>. The film retains many cast members from the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2021/04/22/mortal-kombat-movie-review-a-strong-first-round">first film</a>, while adding numerous iconic characters absent from the original to this follow-up entry.</p><p>The trailer starts with Raiden and Sonya recruiting washed-up action star Johnny Cage, played by <em>The Boys</em> star Karl Urban. After learning about the Mortal Kombat tournament and its fight-to-the-death nature, Cage seems less than thrilled about the prospects of competing. However, we soon see him training with Kitana, played by <em>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em> and <em>Riverdale</em> actress Adeline Rudolph, and facing off against the likes of Baraka, played by <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> actor CJ Bloomfield. We also see Kitana fighting Jade, who is portrayed by Tati Gabrielle, best known for her roles in <em>You</em>, <em>Uncharted,</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdC5mFHPldg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdC5mFHPldg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>We also get a blink-and-you'll-miss-it look at Lewis Tan's Cole Young, who served as the main character of the first film, plus more of Hiroyuki Sanada's Scorpion, including a fight against Noob Saibot, portrayed by Joe Taslim, who fittingly played Sub-Zero in the first movie. The entire trailer exists in the shadow of intimidating looks at Shao Kahn, played by bodybuilder-turned-actor Martyn Ford.</p><p>The first film in this continuity arrived in 2021. Though some didn't like the lack of a tournament structure and the story's handling of characters like Goro and Scorpion, it was still <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2021/04/22/mortal-kombat-movie-review-a-strong-first-round">a fun homage to the games</a>. <em>Mortal Kombat II </em>hits theaters on October 24.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/17/first-mortal-kombat-ii-movie-trailer-showcases-johnny-cage-kitana-shao-kahn-and-more]]></content:encoded>
