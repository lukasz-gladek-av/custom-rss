Yesterday, <em>Bloomberg </em>reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q">posted on Bluesky</a> that Bend was laying off 30% of its staff, or roughly 40 people. Later that day, Bend confirmed the news on <a href="https://x.com/BendStudio/status/1932547248313033104">X</a>, stopping short of revealing how many employees had been affected.&nbsp;</p><p>"Today, we said goodbye to some incredibly talented teammates as we transition to our next project," the post on X reads. "We're deeply thankful for their contributions as they've shaped who we are, and their impact will always be part of our story. This is a difficult moment for our team, but we hold immense respect for everyone who got us here. As we move forward, we remain <span>committed to building the future of Bend Studio with creativity, passion, and innovation in the titles we craft."&nbsp;</span></p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmLMQbopDk&amp;t=1s&amp;pp=ygUeZ2FtZSBpbmZvbXJlciBkYXlzIGdvbmUgcmV2aWV3" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pOmLMQbopDk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span>Bend helped developer Climax Studios release </span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/days-gone-remastered"><span>Days Gone Remastered</span></a><span> back in April, roughly </span><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/days-gone/surviving-in-a-divided-world"><span>six years after the launch of the original game</span></a><span>.
