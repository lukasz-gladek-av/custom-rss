            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is gracing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">the latest cover of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and it's somehow the very first time a Dragon Quest game has done that. Because of the momentous occasion, we spoke to Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, who still works closely on the franchise, about the mainline series' history. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">You can read my full deep dive into that very history here</a>, but I mention all this because Horii is 71 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>By now, many developers have retired or at least stepped back to produce or consult on games in the series they're closely attached to. But Horii is still deeply involved in the creation of each new mainline Dragon Quest, including the in-development <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/05/27/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-announced-a-darker-turn-for-the-series">Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate</a>. I close out my 90-minute interview with Horii by trying to politely ask why he's still working on Dragon Quest to this day. I mention that fellow Japanese game developer with a perhaps similar level of stature in the industry Hideo Kojima, who directed this year's Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, recently stated he's going to develop games until he dies; he apparently even has a USB stick with game ideas for his team to use following his death one day, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/#google_vignette"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ask Horii if he feels the same about game development and why he continues to make Dragon Quest games. Here's what he said:&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, in recent years, there's been increasingly more areas where I rely on other members to work on parts of the Dragon Quest titles," he tells me. "But I would still like to keep myself involved to oversee everything. I do consider Dragon Quest to be my child. I just really love it, and in that sense, I do think I will work on it until I die.</p><p>"I think the next goal for me is to witness the 50th Anniversary [2036]."</p><p>I hope he does witness that anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for its launch, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.
