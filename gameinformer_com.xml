            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Thanks to the massive success of Insomniac's Spider-Man games, its next project, Marvel's Wolverine, is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond">easily one of our highest-anticipated games of the year</a>. Usually, every new piece of news about a game of this caliber would be closely guarded and revealed in grand fashion, but today's release date was a straightforward social media post. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-comes-out-swinging-in-gameplay-trailer">After learning last year that it would drop sometime in fall 2026</a>, we just learned the official release date: September 15.</p><p>The news comes in a quick, six-second video posted to Insomniac's various social media platforms. Text above the video reads, "Let's cut to the chase: Marvel's Wolverine launches September 15, 2026." The video itself just shows the game's key art (which features the illustration of the titular mutant that appears on the game's box art) and text announcing the release date. Fans (like me) hoping this news would be accompanied by some more footage or gameplay details are sadly out of luck.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This is especially interesting timing given that Sony put on one of the biggest State of Play showcases we've seen in a while just a few weeks ago, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/11/marvels-wolverine-probably-wont-be-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play-and-heres-why">Wolverine was notably absent from the lineup</a>. This was not a surprise, as Insomniac suggested on social media that Wolverine wouldn't be shown, but it also teased a bigger look at the game in its most recent trailer, possibly hinting at a larger trailer or dedicated showcase coming this spring. That said, we're not complaining about the locked down release date, and look forward to seeing more of what the game has to offer in the coming months.</p><p>For more Marvel games, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-locks-in-an-august-launch-and-a-few-more-x-men">check out the recent X-Men-focused trailer for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>.
