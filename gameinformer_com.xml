            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>FX is developing an anthology TV series adapting Ubisoft’s Far Cry franchise. The upcoming show will stream on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ internationally.</p><p>According to a press release, the series will “retain Far Cry’s signature standalone storytelling format” and each season will take place in a new setting and star a different cast. Far Cry is being helmed by executive producers Noah Hawley, creator of FX’s <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Alien: Earth</em>, and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney after a legal name change this summer), creator of <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>. Mac, who also co-wrote and stars in the FX docuseries <em>Welcome to Wrexham</em> and Apple TV's <em>Mythic Quest,</em> will join the cast of <em>Far Cry</em> in the starring role.</p><p>“What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of <em>Fargo</em> is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley in a press release. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”</p><p>"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,” said Rob Mac in a press release. “Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support."</p>

<p><em>Far Cry</em>’s executive producer credits also include names from various production companies, such as Emilia Serrano (26 Keys), Nick Frenkel (3 Arts), Jackie Cohn (More Better), and John Campisi. Ubisoft Film &amp; Television executives Gerard Guillemot, John Campisi, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill are also involved.</p><p>FX’s <em>Far Cry </em>has no premiere date or announced cast besides Rob Mac.</p><p>Whether it's the 2010 <em>Prince of Persia</em> film or the 2016 <em>Assassin's Creed</em> film, Ubisoft has never been shy about bringing its franchises to the big and small screens. Far Cry already has a TV show to its name in the form of 2023's<a href="https://gameinformer.com/ubisoft-forward/2023/06/12/heres-your-first-look-at-the-far-cry-blood-dragon-anime"> <em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em></a>, an adaptation of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. There is also the terrible 2008 Uwe Boll Far Cry film, but perhaps that is best forgotten.</p><p>Other recent Ubisoft adaptations include a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/18/netflix-greenlights-live-action-assassins-creed-series-led-by-westworld-halo-producers">live-action Assassin’s Creed series</a> currently in development by Netflix, and the animated show <em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, which premiered on Netflix in October, is nominated for a Best Adaptation trophy for this year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/17/here-are-the-nominees-for-the-game-awards-2025">Game Awards</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on Far Cry, you can read our review of its most recent entry, 2021’s Far Cry 6, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/far-cry-6/far-cry-6-review-the-spark-that-ignites-the-fire">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/25/fx-announces-far-cry-anthology-series-coming-to-hulu-from-alien-earth-and-its-always]]></content:encoded>
