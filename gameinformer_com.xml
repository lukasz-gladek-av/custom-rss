Arguably one of the most interesting details about the game is that it is helmed by Masahiro Sakurai, the director of the Super Smash Bros. series, and the creator of Kirby. This will mark the first time Sakurai has actively worked a dedicated Kirby game since the original Kirby Air Rider in 2003.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/nintendo-is-holding-a-45-minute-kirby-air-riders-direct-on-tuesday]]></content:encoded>
