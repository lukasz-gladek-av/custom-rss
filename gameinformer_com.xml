            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>For years, a lot of China's video game development has happened in the realm of mobile games or as outsourced developers for studios elsewhere in the world. But there's been a shift happening – with big releases like last year's Black Myth: Wukong and plenty more, Chinese developers are aiming for new audiences around the world and seeing massive success. After visiting S-Game's Beijing, China, studio last month to check out hours of its upcoming "kung fu punk" action game, Phantom Blade Zero, I'm feeling pretty confident it's going to be the country's next big video game hit.&nbsp;</p><p>In our newly announced <a href="https://gameinformer.com/ninjagaiden4"><em>Game Informer </em>issue</a>, featuring Ninja Gaiden 4 – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/08/26/cover-reveal-ninja-gaiden-4">read about that cover reveal here</a> – I wrote eight pages about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/kung-fu-punk">Phantom Blade Zero,</a> my time in Beijing, China, playing the game and speaking with the game's director, and even about my attempt at becoming a kung fu master in S-Game's Shanghai-based mocap studio (it's not in the cards for me). But that's not all the Phantom Blade Zero in this issue: <strong>each copy includes a double-sided Phantom Blade Zero poster!!!</strong></p><p>Check out the poster that comes with your issue – at no additional charge, of course – below:&nbsp;</p>
