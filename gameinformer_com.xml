            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>IllFonic released a new trailer for its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a>, during today's PC Gaming Show, and it showcases its first map, Haddonfield Heights. Of course, Haddonfield is the fictional Illinois town where killer Michael Myers attempts to kill Laurie Strode in the original 1978 <em>Halloween </em>film, so it's no surprise a map like this is in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Developer-publisher IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive describe Haddonfield Heights as a map nestled beneath the iconic Haddonfield water tower that brings players deep into the heart of the town, "introducing a warm, tight-knit neighborhood that hides terror behind every picket fence and perfectly manicured lawn." It features a cluster of charming homes, plenty of front yards and winding side streets to hide in, and a neighborhood full of nooks and crannies necessary to run from (or stop) Michael.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Haddonfield Heights trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As a civilian, you will have to scavenge for supplies, guide residents to safety, and locate a phone to call the police before the time runs out in Haddonfield Heights. And if you're playing as Michael, you can expect to prowl the shadows and use abilities like Shape Jump to traverse through the neighborhood unseen and strike without warning.&nbsp;</p><p>"This neighborhood allowed us to reimage the tension of Haddonfield in a way that feels both intimate and terrifying," IllFonic design director Jordan Mathewson writes in a press release. "We wanted players to feel the comfort of the neighborhood they recognize from the film right before we turn it into a panic. Every hedge, hallway, and backyard was built to heighten suspense and reward clever play, whether you're hunting or being hunted."&nbsp;</p>
