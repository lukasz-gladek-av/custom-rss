The update, titled The Regal, will add new characters, more balls, and other features.</p><p>The Regal arrives on Monday, January 26, and adds two characters to the ball-bouncing, town-building roguelike: The Carouser and The Falconer. As detailed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481">Steam post</a>, the Carosuer’s ability allows returning balls to orbit around him, while The Falconer has two falcons at her side that throw balls.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight new balls join the game alongside several new passives that have not been detailed. The developer also teases an additional surprise it’s saving until the update launches. You can watch a YouTube short of the update in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vgGaNZTeEIg">here</a>.</p><p>The Regal is the first of three big post-launch updates planned for Ball x Pit in 2026. The two remaining updates, Shadow and Naturalist, are slated to arrive in April and July, respectively. The Regal is coming to all versions of Ball x Pit on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/ball-x-pits-first-free-update-adds-new-characters-balls-and-more-next-week]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Rockstar representative speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/emergency-services-called-to-grand-theft-auto-maker-rockstar-north-after-reported-boiler-explosion"><em>GameIndustry.biz</em></a> and other outlets suggested that the structural damage was minimal and confirmed that the studio is “open and operational." The representative also stated that the incident was caused by a “malfunction in one of the heating boilers.”</p><p>"Many thanks to those that reached out with concern, and also to the police and fire crews who were on scene quickly to assess the situation - please know that everyone is well and our studio remains open and operational," said Rockstar's spokesperson.</p><p>Rockstar North is currently working on Grand Theft Auto VI,<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delayed-to-november-2026"> set to release on November 19</a> after years of anticipation and a couple of delays.&nbsp;While legions of fans await the game's launch with bated breath, we're just happy that none of Rockstar's employees appear to have been harmed by could have been a much more dangerous situation.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/rockstar-north-open-and-operational-after-fire-crews-respond-to-reported-boiler-room]]></content:encoded>
