            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>An unexpected publisher stepped into the spotlight during <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/everything-announced-at-the-february-playstation-state-of-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2341a4a8-a8a9-4b6a-b81a-622fd5e9d7be" data-entity-substitution="canonical">yesterday's PlayStation State of Play presentation</a>. That publisher was Konami, a once-prominent developer and publisher of video games that, in recent years, has come under fire from gamers for largely neglecting its multiple iconic franchises. Yesterday's State of Play served as a reemergence party of sorts for the publisher, as the company announced multiple projects, including the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-guns-of-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3bdf4820-12c3-42a2-b7b0-cd57df1ba12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/castlevania-belmonts-curse-made-by-konami-and-the-dead-cells-devs-launches" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f6ac4864-5c64-4c84-94d3-3d3870af84fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</a>. Fans expressed excitement after learning these iconic franchises still have pulses, and today, it would seem Castlevania may not only have a pulse, but potentially a new lease on life.</p><p>Following its block on the State of Play, Konami updated its <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/#games">Castlevania Portal Site</a> with the following message regarding Castlevania's 40th anniversary:</p><div><p>The doors of Castlevania open once more.</p><p>This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, “Castlevania” will be revived.</p><p>First up is this title: ‘Castlevania: Belmont's Curse’.</p><p>We couldn’t think in other studios to work together rather than Evil Empire and Motion Twin, studios brimming with talent and passion, to deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation.</p><p>This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania.</p><p>Look forward to the return of the magnificent “nightmare” lurking in the darkness.</p><p>- Castlevania series Production Team</p></div><p>In addition to this message, Konami also released a YouTube video featuring the official Castlevania 40th anniversary logo, which plays off the key art from the original Castlevania. It also features a ton of Castlevania imagery, which could potentially hint at what's next for the franchise. You can view that video below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsIye_bWY_8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsIye_bWY_8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The last true Castlevania release arrived in 2014, with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. Since then, Castlevania has crossed over with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Vampire Survivors, and Dead Cells, but the series has been largely dormant outside of retro collections, re-releases, and cameos in other games. That will change later this year when Castlevania: Belmont's Curse arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/13/konami-promises-numerous-new-castlevania-products-for-40th-anniversary]]></content:encoded>
