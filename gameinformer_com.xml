Characters Yunobo, Tulin, Riju, and Sidon from the game are all getting Amiibos on June 5.</span></span></p>



<p><span><span>Nintendo also promised but has not yet shown, a Mineru's Construct Amiibo for the future. Presumably, the Mineru's Construct Amiibo will be a little like Breath of the Wild’s Guardian Amiibo, which was oversized and a little different.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Though it didn’t overtly say as much, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 will be Amiibo compatible. </span></span><a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the"><span><span><span><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> is getting a Switch 2 release and with it will also come alongside a collection of Amiibo and Amiibo cards.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 Direct aired today, and it was jam-packed with announcements, including hardware specs, new Mario Kart, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/new-sakurai-directed-kirby-air-riders-announced">Kirby</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">Donkey Kong</a> games, and a long list of third-party titles coming to the console. The one thing it didn't detail, however, is the pre-order process, which is a little convoluted.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="56edb9ce-2e0e-4efe-b723-cffc17c36b65" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Pre-orders at participating retailers will go live next Wednesday, April 9. At the time of publishing, retailers have yet to prepare their individual pre-order pages (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?id=pcmcat1742407305710#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20notifications%20about%20the%20new%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%2C%20games%20and%20more">though Best Buy has a link to sign up for updates</a>), but they will likely be updated within the next few days. That said, based on how recent console launches have gone, it will likely be a fairly frantic process with scalpers attempting to buy up stock to resell at a higher price. Once we learn specific launch times, you'll want to be right on the webpage the moment it goes live to maximize your chances.</p>

<p>To avoid that scramble, you can try to grab your console directly from Nintendo, but there's more to that process than meets the eye. If you head to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">Nintendo's website</a>, you'll be able to sign up to indicate interest in purchasing a system once they're available. To be clear, this is not a pre-order, but a sign-up list to indicate who might want to pre-order, so there's no payment information required. You will, however, need an active Nintendo account – more on that below. Once you sign in, you can choose between a base system for $449.99 USD or a bundle including a digital version of Mario Kart World for $499.99 USD.</p>

</article><p>The timeline here is different, however. Invitations from Nintendo won't arrive until a month or so after, on Thursday, May 8. They'll also come in waves, with additional invites sent out to eligible accounts until the store is open to the general public. Invitations will also only go to account holders that meet the following "priority criteria":</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The account must be the one that purchased a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">That Online Membership must have been active for a minimum of 12 months.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must have opted to share gameplay data and played at least 50 hours of games.</li>
</ul><p>If your account fits all three of those criteria, you'll be able to order a console to be shipped to your address – no Nintendo Store pickups are allowed. The link will be active for 72 hours, so it will be less intense than the mad dash on other sites. It also specifies that launch day delivery is not guaranteed and that purchases will be limited to one system per account, though you can also buy accessories for the system.</p>

<p>As wheelchair-bound basketball players, movement involves dragging the Joy-Cons simultaneously to push yourself forward, simulating the movement of pushing a wheelchair. Flicking the controller performs shots, and players can even roll up skateboard-style half-pipes to perform fancy trick dunks. The game’s challenge comes in intuitively using both Joy-Cons at the same time to steer the characters and take it to the hoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

The upcoming multiplayer game will be exclusive to Switch 2.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer follows From Software’s standard of using out-of-context clips, showcasing various characters such as a swordswoman wielding a ringblade and a rocket-powered flying robot. Scenes of a gothic castle complex and cathedral interiors create an oppressive atmosphere, and things take a turn for the bonkers with clips of a guy biting someone’s neck and draining them of a dark substance. A character is also seen transforming into a T-Rex-like monster. From Software describes The Duskbloods as a PvPvE experience, meaning players will face off against other human-controlled characters in addition to in-game enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>What does it all mean? The vague narration stating that “the moontears will flow for one and one alone” doesn’t illuminate much. However, a developer diary with game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will air on April 4 and should, hopefully, explain more. But until then, color us fascinated given From Software’s stellar track record.</p>

<p>The Duskbloods is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

Sakurai is the originator of both the Kirby franchise and Smash Bros., so his involvement with the new Air Riders is exciting news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details are scarce on the new game, but footage revealed Kirby flying along on a star beside three of his other-colored Kirby friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Kirby Air Ride released on GameCube over 20 years ago. It was a racing game with simplified controls and high-speed course navigation, which also highlighted Kirby’s ability to suck up enemies and absorb their abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while some games from today’s Nintendo Direct were highlighted as launch games, Kirby Air Riders features no date of launch on Switch 2.</p>

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wilds/Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, Pokémon Legends Z-A, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are the first titles confirmed to play better on Switch 2.</p>

<h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmDD7JSfhcE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Switch 2 editions of the acclaimed titles feature improved resolution and framerates and now support HDR. They’ll also exclusively support a new feature called Zelda Notes, a new feature for the Nintendo Switch app. This app guides players using voice navigation to find hidden Korok and shrines. Players can also share creations with QR codes, which adds it to another player’s game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/whats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2/">For&nbsp;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members who already own Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Switch 2 upgrade packs will be included with your subscription</a>.</p>

<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0jkSlm6gVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The Switch 2 addition includes Jamboree TV, an expansion introducing new minigames such as Bowser Live, the mouse-controlled Carnival Coaster, and other games utilizing the Switch 2’s hardware features.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5peJd37J-k" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to a graphical and framerate bump, Kirby’s 2021 adventure is also getting a Switch 2 exclusive story DLC called Star-Cross World.

Among other new features, the right Joy-Con also has a mysterious C button, and now we know what it means. The c stands for chat, meaning the Switch 2 will be the first Nintendo console to have native voice chat.</p>

<p>Pressing the button while playing the console will activate chat mode, which creates a line of boxes at the base of the screen with the people in your party. The microphone is included on the top of the main console, so you can speak freely without needing a second microphone. The feature also allegedly can erase background noise: their example had someone using a blender.</p>

<p>You can also fill these boxes, which normally have profile pictures and soundwaves, with game footage. Whether it's the same game or separate ones, players will be able to see each other's screens, though it looks like the footage will have a heavily reduced frame rate, based on what they showed.</p>



<p>You can also show yourself on screen using the Switch 2 Camera, which launches the same day as the console. It can erase your background, placing you in front of your gameplay, or just show a direct feed of your surroundings, no game included. Some games, like Mario Party Jamboree, will also make use of the camera to include players' heads and their reactions. Unlike the game footage, the frame rate of this footage does not look dramatically reduced, though I'm sure that will depend on your internet speed.</p>

<p>This voice chat feature is collectively known as GameChat. The Switch Online service is required to use it, but there will be a months-long period where that's not the case for the game's launch. That period will last from the console's launch in June to March 31, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-launches-in-june-for-44999<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>A question all Nintendo fans have been pondering for years has finally been answered. During today's Nintendo Direct focused on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, the iconic gaming company revealed that the hotly anticipated hybrid gaming system is set to arrive on June 5.</p>

<p>Following the Direct stream, Nintendo revealed on <a href="https://press.nintendo.com/HEADLINE-PLACEHOLDER">its press website</a> that the console will be $449.99. The box will include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nintendo Switch 2 console</li>
	<li>Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R)</li>
	<li>Joy-Con 2 Grip</li>
	<li>Joy-Con 2 Straps</li>
	<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock</li>
	<li>Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable</li>
	<li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter</li>
	<li>USB-C Charging Cable</li>
</ul>

<p>Another version of the console will also be available on launch day that will include a digital copy of Mario Kart World. The Mario Kart World bundle will be $499.99.</p>

<p>It's unclear exactly how pre-orders will yet work, but you can acknowledge your interest by <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">visiting this site</a>, signing into your Nintendo account, and letting Nintendo know you are interested.</p>

<p>The news comes as part of an onslaught of information related to Nintendo's next console during today's hour-long Nintendo Direct. The original Switch launched on March 3, 2017, meaning it will have been over eight years and three months between full console releases for Nintendo. Though the first Switch arrived in March, the company has traditionally launched its home consoles in the fall or holiday seasons. The last time a Nintendo home console arrived in North America during the summer months was August 1991 with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo's handheld systems are much less predictable when it comes to their release dates, though the Game Boy Advance was the last time Nintendo released a handheld platform during the North American summer months.</p>

<p>If you do get lucky enough to snag one, you can get excited about enjoying your Nintendo Switch 2 when it arrives on June 5.</p>
