Although the video is light on flair, it shows off the fluidity and technicality that fans expect.</p><p>The no-frills teaser, which premiered during EVO 2025, shows off a one-on-one training bout between two characters. We still know next to nothing about the game, but the demonstration concludes with a message saying to expect more details during Tokyo Game Show in September.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KkGmeofGSw0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KkGmeofGSw0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New Virtua Fighter Project was <a href="https://youtu.be/pmeGL2JP9N0?si=2sY6qwRtVxAxOB2q">first revealed</a> last December during The Game Awards, and does not have a release window&nbsp;or announced platforms.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/04/check-out-the-first-gameplay-of-the-next-virtua-fighter]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last Friday's THQ Nordic showcase featured the reveal of Darksiders 4. The next entry in the long-running series finally pays off the ending of the 2010 original, uniting all four horsemen of the apocalypse in one game.</p><p>The teaser trailer shows War, Death, Fury, and Strife atop their mounts as they prepare to face the apocalyptic events that conclude the first game. For fans, seeing the story finally move forward is an exciting proposition as each sequel's plot has either run parallel to or taken place before the first Darksiders' narrative. Darksiders 4 is being developed by Gunfire Games, which previously made Darksiders III and is also known for its work on the Remnant franchise.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Although the trailer excludes gameplay footage, Darksiders 4 is described as a fast-paced third-person action game that blends traversal and puzzle-solving. Players will control their preferred Horsemen (how/if you can switch between them during the campaign is unclear), and the game will feature online co-op. Unfortunately, it's unknown how many players can ride together or how cooperative play will work in general.</p><p>Darksiders 4 doesn't have a release window, but it will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
