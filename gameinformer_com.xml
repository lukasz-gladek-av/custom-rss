The mobile version, playable on iOS and Android devices, will be released later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to older Pokémon games, like Pokémon Stadium back in the Nintendo 64 era, Pokémon Champions will allow players around the world to battle each other with all kinds of pocket monsters. It will "feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike," according to the game's description. Revealed during the Pokémon Day Presents showcase held in February of last year, we finally know that we can play Pokémon Champions on Switch (and Switch 2, though a Switch 2 Edition hasn't been announced) in April, before it comes to mobile devices later this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can check out an overview of Pokémon Champions in the trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4v--PNtHWA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4v--PNtHWA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><hr><p><em>Are you excited for Pokémon Champions?
