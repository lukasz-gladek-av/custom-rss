            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">announced plans</a> to increase the prices of its Xbox consoles in the United States for the second time this year, starting on October 5. The company cites “changes in the macroeconomic environment” as the reason for the price adjustments.&nbsp;</p><p>In a time when consoles are becoming more expensive over time rather than cheaper, the five available models of Xbox Series X/S will have their prices raised yet again. Microsoft already increased these prices <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/01/xbox-console-and-accessory-price-increases-begin-today-80-first-party-games-starting">only a few months ago</a>, on May 1.</p><p>Here are the new prices for each Xbox console. For comparison, we've also included the current price (as of May 1) and the original launch price of each piece of hardware.</p><p><u>Xbox Series S 512 GB&nbsp;</u><br><strong>New Price: $399.99</strong><br>Current Price: $379.99&nbsp;<br>Launch Price: $299.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series S 1TB&nbsp;</u><br><strong>New Price: $449.99</strong><br>Current Price: $429.99<br>Launch Price: 349.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series X Digital&nbsp;</u><br><strong>New Price: $599.99</strong><br>Current Price: $549.99<br>Launch Prince: $449.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series X</u><br><strong>New Price: $649.99</strong><br>Current Price: $599.99<br>Launch Price: $499.99</p><p><u>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition</u><br><strong>New Price: $799.99</strong><br>Current Price: $729.99<br>Launch Price: $599.99</p><p>"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration," reads Microsoft's statement. "Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players."</p><p>This second price hike comes in a year full of them. Sony <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">raised the prices</a> of the PlayStation 5 in the UK, Europe, and other territories in April, similarly citing the current economic conditions caused by the US tariffs. Sony then raised the price of the PS5 in the US <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">last month</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo, perhaps most famously, delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the US due to the economic conditions before <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">raising prices on the console's accessories</a> before launch.&nbsp;Last month, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorllYqkrE8JsNVKW_xi1_3j_JLXXMlNa_BTAxerqdNWRmSI54cq">increased the prices of the original Switch models</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The updated Xbox prices come right before the busy holiday season, which will be more challenging than ever for those looking to purchase game consoles as gifts or for themselves. It's an unfortunate circumstance that, as things currently stand, doesn't appear will be going away in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/19/xbox-console-prices-will-increase-again-next-month]]></content:encoded>
