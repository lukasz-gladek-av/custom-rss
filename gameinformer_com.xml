We look forward to sharing even more information in due time. &nbsp;</p><p>Persona 4 has spawned numerous spin-off works, including TV anime, Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and Persona 4: Dancing All Night, and is a special title that has been a part of Atlus for many years and holds a personal place in my heart. We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love. We are confident that this will be a fresh and surprising product for both newcomers and long-time fans, and we look forward to sharing it with you all.</p><p>Additionally, we are actively preparing for the future development of the Persona series as a studio.

"So, when we broke off and made our own, new thing, we left P-Studio intact. That’s saying, 'Hey, look, we’re still making Persona games, but we’re also going to do this new thing.'"</p><p>Persona 4 Revival does not have a release window, but when it launches, it will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-steampunk-rpg-from-the-makers">first announced</a> at this same Xbox Games Showcase back in 2023, but today’s presentation offered a much deeper look at what we can expect.&nbsp;</p><p>In Clockwork Revolution, players take on the role of a customized character named Morgan Vanette, who lives in a seemingly steampunk-inspired alternate history of 1895, in the city of Avalon in a neighborhood called The Tangle. Part of a gang known as the Rotten Row Hooligans, Morgan navigates a world populated both by people and clockwork individuals, and some that seem halfway between the two.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Gameplay shows off plenty of sneaking and combat, as well as some extensive customization tools for both character visuals and weapons. But the most intriguing gameplay shows off special time powers that let Morgan do things like rewind time, rebuild destroyed structures, slow down enemy bullets, and in a larger sense, rewrite the flow of history.</p><p>There’s no word yet on when we can expect Clockwork Revolution to arrive, but the game is targeting a launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
