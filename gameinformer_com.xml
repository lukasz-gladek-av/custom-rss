            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Game Awards airs this Thursday, December 11, but we now know that one of the big reveals will be related to Tomb Raider. This announcement was first revealed in Fortnite (yes, Fortnite) before the franchise’s <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148">official X account</a> shared the news to a broader audience.</p><p>The announcement consists of a piece of art (posted above) that shows a silhouette of Lara Croft atop a pedestal bearing the words "Announcement December 11”. The Tomb Raider X account then posts the following message:</p><p>As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to&nbsp;@thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider</p><p>While the announcement doesn't explicitly promise a new game reveal, it’s been known <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/04/05/crystal-dynamics-announces-new-tomb-raider-game-will-be-powered-by-unreal-engine-5">since 2022</a> that Crystal Dynamics, which has developed every mainline Tomb Raider game since 2006’s Tomb Raider: Legend, is working on a new entry in the series. At the time, the studio announced it was being developed in Unreal Engine 5, but little else is known about the project other than it will be published by Amazon Games (even after this division suffered <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/amazon-lays-off-more-than-14000-including-significant-role-reductions-across-its-gaming">mass layoffs in October</a>). The development of the game was reportedly also unaffected by the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-an-unknown-number-of-staff">rounds of layoffs</a> that hit Crystal Dynamics in August.&nbsp;</p><p>The last mainline Tomb Raider game was 2018’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/in-the-shadow-of-something-greater">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>. Since then, fans have been treated to two remastered collections of the first six games in the series: Tomb Raider I-III Remastered in 2024 and Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered earlier this year. Meanwhile, Season 2 of Netflix's <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> animated series is set to premiere on December 11 – the same day as The Game Awards. Thursday is shaping up to be a big day for Lara Croft fans.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on The Game Awards, here's the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/17/here-are-the-nominees-for-the-game-awards-2025">full list of award nominations</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/08/the-future-of-tomb-raider-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards]]></content:encoded>
