This time, the popular shoe brand has partnered with Xbox for a clog modeled after Microsoft’s flagship console.</p><p>Although this collaboration is meant to coincide with the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary, this special edition Croc clog appears to be modeled after the Xbox One/Series X/S controller. The black shoe is adorned with the Xbox face buttons, d-pad, the white Xbox button, and even pairs of analog sticks. The interior of the shoe sports the Xbox brand name with the Xbox logo adorning the heel straps. The shoe also comes with a limited-edition five-piece Jibbitz charm pack inspired by series such as Halo, Fallout, Doom, and Sea of Thieves.&nbsp;</p><p>You can purchase the shoe beginning tomorrow, November 25, from the Crocs <a href="https://www.crocs.com/p/xbox-classic-clog/211439.html?cgid=xbox&amp;cid=001">website</a> for $80.&nbsp;</p><p>To read more recent Xbox news, check out some of these announcements from last week's Xbox Partner Preview for games such as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/new-gameplay-trailer-for-arthurian-action-game-tides-of">Tides of Annihilation</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/20/reanimal-the-next-game-from-the-little-nightmares-team-drops-in-february">Reanimal</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-is-the-next-game-from-the-vampire-survivors-team">Vampire Crawlers</a>, the next game from the creator of Vampire Survivors.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2025/11/24/crocs-and-xbox-partner-for-a-controller-inspired-shoe-thats-available]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>The Star Fox-inspired Wild Blue has a new name and gameplay trailer. Now re-christened as Wild Blue Skies, the upcoming retro throwback has over four minutes of new gameplay footage.</p><p>Wild Blue Skies was first revealed in March, and this homage to Star Fox has some authentic expertise behind it; Giles Goddard, a former Nintendo programmer who worked on the original Star Fox, leads the development team at the Kyoto-based Chuhai Labs. &nbsp;The gameplay trailer, revealed by <em>IGN</em>, shows off an unedited dogfighting sequence through the ancient ruins of a stormy planet.&nbsp;</p><p>Wild Blue Skies centers on ace pilot Bowie Stray and his team taking on the forces of the evil Grimclaw. The flight combat, along with the comms chatter of your dorky anthromorphic animal comrades, certainly captures the spirit of Nintendo’s oft-neglected rail shooter.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25wVPzOTSLU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Wild Blue Skies is currently confirmed for PC only, but it does not have a release window.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/24/star-fox-inspired-wild-blue-skies-formerly-wild-blue-gets-extended-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>
