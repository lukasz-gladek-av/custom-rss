            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dead or Alive's last mainline entry dropped nearly seven years ago, so the long-running fighting series was due for a revival. Today's State of Play showcase confirmed exactly that, not only announcing Dead or Alive 6 Last Round, a remaster of the sixth entry on PS5, but also a brand new game, which may or may not be Dead or Alive 7.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRvKpCznyJI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRvKpCznyJI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The video description for the Dead or Alive 6 Last Round announcement refers to the project as "the definitive version of Dead or Alive 6." It not only brings the game to PlayStation 5, but it also adds DLC characters to the main roster and teases the addition of more playable fighters and costumes in future updates. Additionally, a free-to-play version of the game will be available at launch, though it's unclear how that would differ from the paid version. You'll be able to play either version on June 25, when Last Round launches.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxB5NcPrN4c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxB5NcPrN4c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After series producer Yosuke Hayashi introduced Last Round, he threw in a teaser for another game: Dead or Alive is getting another entry. While it might be called Dead or Alive 7, it's currently just referred to as "Dead or Alive New Project." The brief teaser also calls attention to the fact that 2026 marks the Dead or Alive Series' 30th anniversary, so the pair of projects is a part of developer Team Ninja's celebration of that milestone.</p><p>For more Dead or Alive, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dead-or-alive-6/a-low-blow">check out our review of the sixth game</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today's PlayStation State of Play kicked off the reveal of a sequel to 2021's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/kena-bridge-of-spirits/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review-one-of-the-best-adventures-of-the-year">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>. Titled Kena: Scars of Kosmora, the adventure sees an older Kena travel to a new land, and it's coming this year.</p><p>In Scars of Kosmora Kena, now older and more famous, travels to a mysterious new island in search of a cure for an affliction and to reconnect with a long-lost friend. &nbsp;Unfortunately, a powerful corruption fractures her staff, so she must master a new and forgotten form of Spirit Guiding that allows her to command the elements.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12EQpTwn4lY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Most interestingly, the trailer does not show any of her little friends, the Rot, that accompanied her in the first game. Instead, she joined by new animal companions such as a small, magical fox, and we even see her riding a deer-like fox in an open world. Developer Ember Lab promises deeper, more dynamic combat as the action still sees Kena using her staff to unleash combo attacks and parry incoming offense. She also uses it to conjure giant green crystals to drop on foes or transform the staff into a heavier, claymore-like weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>Kena: Scars of Kosmora is coming later this year for PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/kena-scars-of-kosmora-guides-players-to-a-new-adventure-this-year]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last year, Sucker Punch Productions launched <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> exclusively on PlayStation 5, with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-owners-get-free-multiplayer-legends-mode-update-in-2026">the promise of a free update for its multiplayer Legends mode</a>. Now, courtesy of a new trailer during today's State of Play, we know Ghost of Yōtei Legends goes live on March 10.&nbsp;</p><p>This free update will go live for anyone who owns Ghost of Yōtei and, similar to Ghost of Tsushima Legends mode, will feature cooperative multiplayer action for up to four players. This time, you'll be taking on the "demonic Yōtei Six," which appear to be mythological spins on the Yōtei Six protagonist Atsu fought against in the game's single-player campaign.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Ghost of Yōtei Legends release date trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYyhow-EU8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYyhow-EU8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In this trailer, we got a look at the Spider, Oni, Kitsune, and Snake, and while they all look somewhat human, they are also clearly infused with elements of mythology and folk tale legend that make them appear otherworldly; they probably fight using otherworldly powers, too. We see the four-player party in the trailer fight various mob enemies in an effort to reach the demonic Yōtei Six in all kinds of locales (in different seasons, too).&nbsp;</p><p>Players will choose between four classes, which haven't yet been announced, and utilize different skills, weapons, and more to take down bosses.&nbsp;</p><p>Ghost of Yōtei's Legends update launches as a free update to the game on March 10.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ghost-of-yotei/action-and-vengeance-unbounded"><em>Game Informer's </em>Ghost of Yōtei review</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/16/sucker-punch-productions-co-founder-brian-fleming-is-departing-from-the-studio">Sucker Punch's co-founder Brian Fleming is departing from the studio</a>. After that, read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/best-of-2025/2025/12/16/the-top-ten-games-of-2025">why Ghost of Yōtei was one of <em>Game Informer's </em>top 10 games of the year</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out the Legends update next month?
