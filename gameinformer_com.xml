            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the first Layers of Fear, and for fans, developer Bloober Team is celebrating in the best way possible: by announcing a new entry. Layers of Fear 3 is officially on the way.&nbsp;</p><p>A live-action teaser trailer features a man reciting William Blake’s poem <em>The Sick Rose</em>, which is all fans have to decipher meaning from regarding what Layers of Fear 3 entails. The trailer did not reveal gameplay, a release window, or platforms, but we did at least get a logo for the game. Some might say that’s something.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxU-9A3tw80"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxU-9A3tw80" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Layers of Fear is a franchise coming straight from our hearts and a beloved Bloober Team story,” says Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno in a press release. “The one that we keep on narrating since decade, it was the project that shaped our studio’s identity and set us on the path of crafting unforgettable psychological horror experiences. Ten years have passed, but we’re far from saying the last word - now we are revealing something new in the franchise. We hope it will plant a seed of excitement for the fans of this title.”</p><p>Bloober Team revealed more 10th anniversary goodies. For starters, the Layers of Fear games are being discounted. The first game is 90 percent off right now, and on Friday, the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/04/27/check-out-layers-of-fears-unreal-engine-5-performance-in-new-gameplay-trailer">2023 reimagining</a> will be discounted by 60 percent (but those who own the 2016 game can get this in a bundle for 70 percent off). A series of novels based on the franchise is in the works; the first is written by Marta Bijan and will be released at the end of the year. Fans will also be treated to digital and physical soundtracks for Layers of Fear and other Bloober Team games like The Medium and Cronos: The New Dawn.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Layers of Fear 3, we also know that Bloober Team is making a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill">remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>. It'll be interesting to see which game arrives first.
