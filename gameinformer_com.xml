            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-enhanced-comes-to-playstation-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Between <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/forza-horizon-5/firing-on-all-cylinders">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages/believe-in-the-shield">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/worthy-of-a-museum">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, Xbox's exclusives aren't so exclusive anymore, as all three games have made their way to the PlayStation 5 in the past few months. Today, we learned that Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, the harrowingly beautiful action game from Ninja Theory, will be joining their ranks, making its way onto Sony's platform sometime this summer. You can hear it announced by the team itself in a new trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On the same day it comes to PS5, Hellblade II will get some "exciting new features" across all platforms as a free update. This new iteration is known as the "Enhanced" version, though it's unclear how exactly the game will be improved. The newly published PlayStation Store page mentions "added features and immersive haptic feedback," so we can probably expect some new features to tie in with the Dualsense controller.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II originally launched a year ago today on Xbox Series X/S and PC. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/conquering-old-demons">Reviewer Marcus Stewart gave it a 9 out of 10</a>, writing that, "gripping storytelling, refined gameplay, and a jaw-dropping presentation make for a more wholly satisfying sophomore outing." For another of his Xbox reviews also on PlayStation, you can read (<a href="https://youtu.be/dLrLzuwWbCI?si=9KqKoAcGxbKCFVEp">or watch</a>) <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages/believe-in-the-shield">what he though about Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
