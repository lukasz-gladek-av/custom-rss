Ahead of an anticipated Pokémon Day stream later this month on February 27, The Pokémon Company International has announced that a yearlong campaign to celebrate the 30th Anniversary will begin this weekend with a Super Bowl LX commercial.&nbsp;</p><p>The company released a quick teaser for the Super Bowl LX commercial on its YouTube channel today, showing an excited Jigglypuff sitting backstage on a couch, presumably waiting to perform the halftime show of her dreams. This commercial will be the "campaign debut" of yearlong details, announcements, and more.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yogNTgCr9-A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yogNTgCr9-A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"The Pokémon community has been the foundation and inspiration for the brand since the very beginning, and the passion of our fans is what has allowed Pokémon to have a lasting impact on pop culture around the world and across generations," Pokémon Company International president Kenji Okubo writes in a press release. "As we look to the next 30 years and beyond, we invite trainers to join in celebrating this landmark milestone, starting with Super Bowl LX, where they'll see themselves and their fandom reflected in unexpected ways."&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the Super Bowl commercial, The Pokémon Company International has already shared some details about what to expect for this anniversary celebration. Available now at participating retailers, the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/product-gallery/pokemon-day-2026-collection">Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</a> celebrates Pokémon Day, and you can also soon pick up Pokémon TCG: First Partner Illustration Collection cards from Series 1, which spotlights first partner Pokémon from the Kanto, Sinnoh, and Alola regions. Series 1 of the set will be released on March 20, and more regions will be featured in new First Partner Illustration Collection cards set to release in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting today, you can visit the Pokémon Center online to purchase exclusive <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration">30th Anniversary-inspired merchandise</a> that includes apparel, TCG accessories, home decor, and more.

Nintendo says the Direct will feature "roughly 30 minutes of upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch games," and considering it's a third-party showcase, it's unlikely we'll see any big first-party reveals or updates.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ommYYipEGow"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ommYYipEGow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There are a lot of third-party games coming to Switch 2 this year like Pokémon Pokopia (March 5), Pragmata (April 24), Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection (March 13), Resident Evil Requiem, Village Gold Edition, and Biohazard Gold Edition (February 27), WWE 2K26 (March 6), Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties (February 12), and Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection (March 27), to name a few. There's a good chance we'll see updates to some of these games alongside brand-new third-party reveals.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, we don't even have to wait 24 hours to learn more as the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase will air on Wednesday, February 5, at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/03/mario-kart-world-is-the-switch-2s-best-selling-game-so-far-and-its-not-even-close">Mario Kart World is the Switch 2's best-selling game</a>, and then check out this story about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/03/the-switch-is-officially-nintendos-best-selling-console-ever">the Switch is officially Nintendo's best-selling console ever</a>.
