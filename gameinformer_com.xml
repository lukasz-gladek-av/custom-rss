            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> had quite the 2024 on PlayStation 5 and PC, and it's set to bring its bullet heaven, bug-killing mayhem to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august">Xbox later this month on August 26</a>. Ahead of the game's launch on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox has released a new "Bring the Boom" trailer highlighting the fun (and explosions) of Helldivers 2, and at the end of it, there seems to be a tease for a Halo 3: ODST collaboration or crossover.&nbsp;</p><p>At roughly 1 minute and 11 seconds in, after the meat and potatoes of the trailer have finished, the video fades away to one of Helldiver 2's cities, moody and atmospheric with rain and few lights on the horizon. Then, the smooth jazz of a saxophone as a Helldiver pod drops into the city. Check it out for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it's pretty clear what Xbox is trying to do here: that's a Halo 3: ODST tease. Sure, Helldivers <em>do </em>drop into cities, but in the game, it's typically not as moody or as ambient as what's pictured here â€“ what <em>is </em>as moody or as ambient as what's here is the atmosphere of Halo 3: ODST. And then the saxophone seals the deal. As for what it means or when we can expect to learn more, that remains unclear. But given Helldivers 2 has crossed over with PlayStation's Killzone series before, it wouldn't be surprising for the game to feature cosmetics or something from one of Xbox's most beloved games.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"><em>Game Informer's </em>Helldivers 2 review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/halo_3_odst/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx"><em>Game Informer's </em>Halo 3: ODST review</a>.
