            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Thunderful Publishing has announced Godbreakers, a co-op action game and the debut title by developer To The Sky. Slated to launch later this year, players can try the newly revealed game now via a demo.</p><p>Godbreakers sees players control vessels of humanity summoned by celestial beings to destroy a dangerous AI called the Monad. Accomplishing this involves defeating enemies and absorbing their powers, and up to four players can battle alongside each other (online only) in fluid, fast-paced hack ‘n’ slash action.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qF4thNOpgSI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qF4thNOpgSI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Each player controls an Archetype, a class of character defined by a unique weapon, traits, and playstyle, such as dual swords, a naginata-like polearm, or a laser cannon. The game includes six different Archetypes for players to experiment with, each with a passive trait tied to their weapon and three unlockable cooldown-based abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The run-based roguelike features six biomes filled with unique enemies, hazards, and large-scale, multi-phase boss battles. While the game primarily emphasizes mowing down enemies in combat arenas, biomes also feature traversal challenges, and players wield a grappling hook used to pull themselves forward.</p><p>Godbreakers is slated to launch sometime this year for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam and Epic.&nbsp;The game's demo is now live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2687400/GODBREAKERS/">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/29/steal-your-enemys-powers-in-godbreakers-a-new-co-op-action-game-coming-this-year]]></content:encoded>
