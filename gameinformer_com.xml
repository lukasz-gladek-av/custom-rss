            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/19/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When we told you that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/letter-from-the-editor/2025/03/25/game-informer-is-back" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="610a6f9e-2d93-426c-b81d-a4bcfdb648e6" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><em>Game Informer </em>was coming back</a>, we let you know that we didn't just mean our website, podcast, and video presence; we told you that the print magazine for which the outlet has been known over the last three-plus decades is also returning. After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/letter-from-the-editor/2025/06/06/you-can-now-subscribe-to-game-informer-magazine-again" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d83ea883-d5e8-4929-9d9b-9c9cfb80c75f" data-entity-substitution="canonical">relaunching our subscription program earlier this month</a>, we are pleased to announce, ahead of our full cover reveal next week, that the game gracing our first cover in nearly a year is Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</p><p>You may have seen yesterday that several outlets (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/18/a-new-generation-of-vault-hunting"><em>GI </em>included</a>) shared hands-on previews of Gearbox's upcoming shooter. That's just the start of what we played and saw. In addition to that day at 2K's Novato, California offices, we spent two full days inside Gearbox's Frisco, Texas headquarters, exploring new areas, trying out all four of the base game's Vault Hunters, and picking the brains of tons of folks behind the Borderlands franchise.</p><p>The image you see above is not our cover, but you won't have to wait long to see the art and read the story. We will reveal our cover art on Tuesday, June 24, before launching the issue digitally later that day. That also means that anyone who has subscribed to the print edition of <em>Game Informer </em>will receive their first issue in the coming weeks. If you haven't subscribed to our print or digital edition, there's still time to lock in the early-bird pricing and receive the Borderlands 4 issue!

We're beyond excited to be back to bringing you striking cover art and deep dive articles on the biggest games in the industry!
