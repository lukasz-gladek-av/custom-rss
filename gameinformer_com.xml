            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>IllFonic released a new trailer for its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a>, during today's PC Gaming Show, and it showcases its first map, Haddonfield Heights. Of course, Haddonfield is the fictional Illinois town where killer Michael Myers attempts to kill Laurie Strode in the original 1978 <em>Halloween </em>film, so it's no surprise a map like this is in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Developer-publisher IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive describe Haddonfield Heights as a map nestled beneath the iconic Haddonfield water tower that brings players deep into the heart of the town, "introducing a warm, tight-knit neighborhood that hides terror behind every picket fence and perfectly manicured lawn." It features a cluster of charming homes, plenty of front yards and winding side streets to hide in, and a neighborhood full of nooks and crannies necessary to run from (or stop) Michael.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Haddonfield Heights trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2iqQykoqB8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As a civilian, you will have to scavenge for supplies, guide residents to safety, and locate a phone to call the police before the time runs out in Haddonfield Heights. And if you're playing as Michael, you can expect to prowl the shadows and use abilities like Shape Jump to traverse through the neighborhood unseen and strike without warning.&nbsp;</p><p>"This neighborhood allowed us to reimage the tension of Haddonfield in a way that feels both intimate and terrifying," IllFonic design director Jordan Mathewson writes in a press release. "We wanted players to feel the comfort of the neighborhood they recognize from the film right before we turn it into a panic. Every hedge, hallway, and backyard was built to heighten suspense and reward clever play, whether you're hunting or being hunted."&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Normally, releasing a game is a cause for celebration for a developer, but two months after launch, Wreckreation studio Three Fields Entertainment is facing some hard times. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-ugcPost-7402348124054376448-Yfpq/">a post from its CEO on LinkedIn</a> (which we learned about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wreckreation-maker-three-fields-entertainment-puts-whole-studio-on-redundancy-notice">thanks to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>), </a>the entire studio's staff is currently "on notice for redundancy."&nbsp;</p><p>"Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career," CEO Fiona Sperry's post reads. "After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy."</p><p>The post goes on to detail the company's financial status. Despite the game being published by THQ Nordic, Sperry claims the studio has had to self-fund "most of this year and all of the post launch content," and after doing so for months, leadership "simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form." As a result, the post is both a public announcement of the redundancies and a call to potential business partners that can help fund the studio as it finds its footing.</p><p>"My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," Sperry's post continues. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."</p><p>Three Fields Entertainment was founded in 2014 by former developers of the Burnout series. Since then, it's developed games like Dangerous Golf, Lethal VR, Danger Zone 1 and 2, and Dangerous Driving. Its latest game, Wreckreation, launched on October 28 to a relatively lukewarm response, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/wreckreation/">sitting at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. If you want to check it out for yourself, you can pick it up on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, or PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/wreckreation-studio-three-fields-entertainment-founded-by-former-burnout-devs-puts]]></content:encoded>
