            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/nintendo-has-a-plan-for-continuous-flow-of-switch-2-through-the-holidays<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’re just three weeks away from the launch of the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the sequel to the second-best-selling console in the company’s history. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa announced last week that it forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units worldwide and another 4.5 million units of the original Switch during the current fiscal year. Despite many fans out there unable to secure a preorder for the upcoming console, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser says the company plans to keep the Switch 2 available through the holidays.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser"><em>IGN</em></a> to discuss the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gallery/2025/05/15/nintendo-store-san-francisco-photo-tour">new Nintendo store</a> opening up next week in San Francisco, California, Bowser discussed this forecast and what it means for Switch 2 supply over the coming months. When asked by<em> IGN</em> if Nintendo will be able to meet demand in the U.S. at launch, Bowser explained the company believes it will be able to do so.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“That forecast [Furukawa’s 15 million units sold] was really driven by wanting to match, if you will, what we accomplished with Nintendo Switch in the first 10 months of its release,” Bowser told <em>IGN</em>. “As we look at our plans here in the U.S., we do believe we’ll have production and supply that will allow us to meet consumer demand.</p><p>“We know there’s been strong positive reaction to Nintendo Switch 2 early on and we’ve seen that through our preorders, but we do have a plan to have a continuous flow of product that’ll be available through the holidays.”</p><p><em>IGN</em> then asks Bowser about the price and whether people unable to secure a Switch 2 around launch should be concerned about possible price increases in the future due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s shifting policies around tariffs. Bowser says Nintendo made a commitment by announcing the price of Switch 2, but notes that the situation is still in flux.</p>

<p>“Well, we made a commitment by announcing the price of both the single SKU at $449 and then the bundled SKU with Mario Kart World at $499,” Bowser said. “And we really thought it was important that we established that price point, even after further tariffs were announced, to give consumers that comfort that they would be able to purchase at that price point. Obviously, it’s still a very fluid situation and it’s difficult to determine what may be happening in the upcoming months or weeks.</p><p>“But our commitment is to find ways within existing market conditions or changing market conditions to make our products, including Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, as obtainable as we possibly can.”</p><p>The rest of the <em>IGN</em> interview is a great read and covers a variety of topics so be sure to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser">check it out</a>.
