The follow-up to 2023's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2023/04/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-1-upping-the-rest" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="baa061f7-68fb-43b0-a170-a578c0fe376b" data-entity-substitution="canonical"><em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, which grossed more than $1.3 billion at the box office, <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> looks to dramatically expand the scope by not only bringing our beloved heroes to space, but also by introducing several beloved characters to this cinematic continuity.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-casts-brie-larson-as-rosalina-benny-safdie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fc6d77e-b384-4d64-8be3-0e2c24518956" data-entity-substitution="canonical">first trailer</a> gave us looks at Rosalina (voiced by Brie Larson) and Bowser Jr. (voiced by Bennie Safdie), and the second trailer finally paid off the post-credits teaser of the first film by introducing us to Yoshi. While we don't know who voices him, it may be less consequential than who voices the other characters, as, right now, it just seems like he might make various noises with an occasional "Yoshi" thrown into his dialogue.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of Yoshi's introduction, we also got looks at Tostarena Town and the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey, the Frog Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3, Birdo from Super Mario Bros. 2, and plenty of nods from other Mario games.</p><p>You can see the trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yP5RGz_CRFM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yP5RGz_CRFM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>arrives in theaters on April 1, 2026, exactly three years after the premiere of the first movie.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/yoshi-debuts-in-second-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer]]></content:encoded>
