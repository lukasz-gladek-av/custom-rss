That would be The Best in the World and current World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, who graces the cover of a WWE game for the first time since 2012.</p><p>In a virtual preview event with developer Visual Concepts, we learned all about what the next WWE 2K game has in store. In addition to being the first WWE 2K game this generation to leave PlayStation 4 and Xbox One behind, it also boasts highly requested new match types and weapons, reworked gameplay mechanics, its largest superstar roster yet, and much more.</p>

<h2>The Roster</h2><p>WWE 2K26 boasts over 400 superstars, both current and legends, at launch, the biggest day one roster to date. While we only know of a small handful of names currently, the roster includes a host of new talent. Here are the confirmed superstars so far:</p><ul><li><strong>Andre the Giant</strong></li><li><strong>Bret Hart</strong></li><li><strong>Blake Monroe</strong></li><li><strong>Bron Breakker</strong></li><li><strong>Charlotte Flair</strong></li><li><strong>CM Punk</strong></li><li><strong>Cody Rhodes</strong></li><li><strong>Drew McIntyre</strong></li><li><strong>Eddie Guerrero</strong></li><li><strong>Iyo Sky</strong></li><li><strong>Izzi Dame</strong></li><li><strong>John Cena</strong></li><li><strong>Kane</strong></li><li><strong>Liv Morgan</strong></li><li><strong>Logan Paul</strong></li><li><strong>Myles Borne</strong></li><li><strong>Naomi</strong></li><li><strong>Penta</strong></li><li><strong>Randy Orton</strong></li><li><strong>Randy Savage</strong></li><li><strong>Rey Fénix</strong></li><li><strong>Rhea Ripley</strong></li><li><strong>Roddy Piper</strong></li><li><strong>Roman Reigns</strong></li><li><strong>Rusev</strong></li><li><strong>Seth Rollins</strong></li><li><strong>Stephanie Vaquer</strong></li><li><strong>The Undertaker</strong></li></ul><p>Additionally, former TNA World Champion and recent WWE signee <strong>Joe Hendry</strong> will be included as a pre-order bonus.</p><p>When asked if Lucha Libre AAA, which WWE acquired in 2025, would have any representation in WWE 2K26, Visual Concepts coyley replied, “Maybe. Stay tuned.” It’s worth noting that the game’s website features a teaser of a desk laden with WWE easter eggs and one suspiciously prominent photo of an iguana, potentially a nod to AAA star Mr. Iguana.</p>

<h2>New Match Types And Gameplay Updates</h2><p>WWE 2K26 will introduce four new match types: Inferno, I Quit, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster. Like 2K25, every match can be contested under intergender rules, so male and female wrestlers can compete against each other. The commentary teams now include Wade Barrett and Booker T as well.</p><p>Before the match starts, you can spice up and have more agency during introductions thanks to more interactive entrances. As superstars make their way to the ring, you can now toggle one of three pre-set special animations and interactions based on superstar face/heel alignment (such as offering/rejecting pre-match handshakes). You can similarly trigger pyro on the stage or in the ring. Players can also now choose to start matches in different ways, such as hyping the crowd before initiating contact or rushing an opponent before the bell rings.</p><p>As for gameplay updates, thumbtacks and shopping carts can now be used as weapons. Tables can also be stacked on top of each other in another much-requested addition. Visual Concepts touts improved reactability to falling/getting slammed on weapons, where superstars behave more realistically and take more damage from weapon offense.</p><p>They also tout smaller touches, such as how thumbtacks will visually stick to the bodies of characters to display damage. 2K26 also features improved and expanded crowd and barricade combat features. Other presentational touches include the addition of championship belt podiums at ringside during title matches.</p><p>The reversal and stamina systems have been revamped, and physics interactions have been upgraded. Visual Concepts compared 2K26’s physics as being akin to Smackdown vs. Raw 2011, for reference.</p>

<h2>Ringside Pass</h2><p>Visual Concepts is ditching its usual DLC pack model to introduce its version of a traditional battle pass. Called the Ringside Pass, it consists of 60 free tiers and 40 premium (paid) tiers where players can earn XP to unlock new content simply by playing the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The team describes this as an "added value upgrade to DLC" in that players will pay the same amount of money they normally would for the old DLC packs, but the Ringside Pass rewards more content. Players earn XP across all game modes, and players who reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season can unlock Superstars, cosmetics, customization items, VC, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Visual Concepts also confirms that unlockable DLC superstars are available in the first section of the Ringside Pass, so it seemingly won’t take as long to gain new faces. The studio points out that Superstars and Legends that used to be part of the Supercharger, which is no longer a thing in 2K26, will instead be obtainable in the Season 1 Ringside Pass' free tier.&nbsp;</p><p>Six Seasons of Ringside Pass will be released throughout the year, with the Season 1 pass launching alongside the game.</p><h2>Showcase Mode</h2><p>2K26’s Showcase Mode will center on the career of cover star CM Punk. Narrated by the champ himself, this interactive documentary lets players relive Punk’s biggest matches and moments as well as engage in “What If?” style fantasy matches. For example, Visual Concepts says Showcase will explore the feuds and matches that could have happened if Punk hadn’t left WWE for nearly a decade in 2014.</p>

<h2>The Island</h2><p>The Island, the explorable quest-filled hub that debuted in 2K25, makes its return in improved form. This mode is available on all platforms this year (including PC, where it was absent last year). The mode’s story builds upon last year’s iteration, with a player choosing one of three factions battling to fill the power vacuum left after Roman Reigns’ fall as the tribal chief.</p><p>The Island’s progression system has been reworked, and it features a new environment: Scrapyard Brawl. It also features more immersive quests with cutscenes and dialogue screens. The Island boasts new Towers, shops, and branded gear for players to purchase using in-game and paid currency.</p><h2>My Rise</h2><p>The story-driven campaign is back with two new division-based storylines, and Visual Concepts says the babyface/heels decisions have a larger impact this time. My Rise is also more replayable, as players can continue engaging with the mode after wrapping up the main story to earn additional unlockables and achievements.</p><h2>My GM</h2><p>The popular general manager simulation mode features more match types, more possible matches, and more outcomes. Players can book intergender matches as well as bouts pitting 5, 6, and 8 superstars against each other. My GM now has more shows per season, the option to play a 50-week season, more cross-brand PLEs, and new management challenges to test would-be showrunners.</p><h2>My Faction</h2><p>WWE 2K’s collectible card game has new intergender lineups and the ability to “Quick Swap” cards during battles for more instantaneous and strategic play. &nbsp;New My Faction chemistry allows players to boost card performance and run-in support. Of course, you can now collect new card designs and enjoy a regular release of new themed card packs and seasonal content throughout the year.</p>
