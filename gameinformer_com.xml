Developed by Bit Reactor in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment, Star Wars Zero Company puts you in control of Hawks, a former Republic officer, in a gritty story starring an original cast set during the waning Clone Wars.</p>

<p>As Hawks, you command a ragtag group of mercenaries and bounty hunters from across the galaxy to combat a dangerous, emerging threat. Hawks' appearance and class are fully customizable, and the operatives you recruit come from a wide array of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, astromechs, Jedi, and more. Your squadmates are also customizable through their appearances, loadouts, and abilities.</p>



<p>While in the field, players engage in turn-based tactics missions. Player choice looks to play a role in shaping the narrative and gameplay. You can also increase the bonds between your squadmates, unlocking powerful combat synergies. Between missions, you can build up your base and leverage your intelligence network of informants to stay on top of your enemies' moves.</p>

<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," Bit Reactor CEO and creative director Greg Foertsch said in a press release. "It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and a deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>
