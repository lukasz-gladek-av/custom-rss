            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/scott-pilgrim-ex-is-a-new-throwback-beat-em-up">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, the new retro brawler by Tribute Games, the team behind TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge and Marvel Cosmic Invasion, has a new trailer revealing a March 3 release date. In addition, two new playable characters have been revealed.</p><p>Today’s trailer showcases two more former enemies of Scott who will help him clean up the streets of Toronto: Matthew Patel and Robot-01. Matthew Patel is one of Ramona’s formerly evil exes, and his combat style emphasizes crowd control and manipulation. This is due to his ability to summon demon hipsters to distract enemies and lay traps on the field. Patel can also manipulate fire and summon supernatural arms.</p><p>Robot-01 was created by the Katayanagi Twins to harm Scott, but it now uses abilities, like firing long-range blasts and rocketing across the screen, to aid him. Robot-01 can also rain explosive projectiles, acting as a screen-clearing attack. See how Robot-01 and Patel hold their own in the trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>These two new faces join a playable roster consisting of Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/scott-pilgrim-ex-adds-lucas-lee-and-roxie-richter-as-playable-characters">Lucas Lee, and Roxie Richter</a>.
