            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After a few years in a console's life cycle, its common to see dips in price for its older games and hardware, but in 2025, the opposite has been true. The latest culprit of the rising cost of gaming is Xbox Game Pass, which we learned today would be getting new features, but a massive increase in monthly fees. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">Ultimate, the highest tier of the service, will cost 50 percent more</a>, going from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month. A breakdown of the new tiers is included below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Summerfall Studios (a developer founded in part by Dragon Age writer David Gaider) made its debut with Stray Gods, a musical game starring modern-day adaptations of the ancient Greek pantheon. Its next game, Malys, is a massive departure in both tone and gameplay. Earlier this April, Summerfall announced a Kickstarter for this new project, but unfortunately, it failed to reach its funding goal. However, the game still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3449690/view/525346350588493892?l=english">entered early access this past June</a>, and now, just a few months later, <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">it's hitting 1.0</a>, launching on Steam on October 24.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdOC7dwPUzM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdOC7dwPUzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This deckbuilder tells the story of Noah, a demon hunter, on his quest to slay the Malys, an evil creature with the city in a chokehold. The game's combat encounters are exorcisms, and you'll play and burn cards in order to expose demons' true names and expel them from their hosts. According to <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">a blogpost on Summerfall's website</a>, the 1.0 update will also include "cloud saves, a fully playable story, all three regions and the final boss fight, as well as a full scale music update across the game."</p><p>The blog post also mentions that the price will increase slightly at launch, so if you're interested in grabbing it cheaper (it's currently $9.99 in the US), make sure to do so before October 24.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/malys-a-deckbuilder-from-the-stray-gods-team-enters-10-later-this-month]]></content:encoded>
