            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker has been on the radars of RPG and fantasy fans for years, since studio Rebel Wolves, which is comprised of ex-Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 developers, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/16/ex-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2077-developers-form-new-studio-rebel-wolves-to-develop-next-gen">revealed it was working on a new RPG back in 2022</a>. The game was featured during the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this month, giving us <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-and">our first look at The Blood of Dawnwalker gameplay</a>, and now, Rebel Wolves and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new 20-minute gameplay overview.&nbsp;</p><p>In it, we get a new look at the game's Witcher-inspired combat, magic system, choice-driven dialogue, vampire enemies, and so much more. It continues to look awesome, and considering the pedigree of Rebel Wolves, it's a game I'm excited to play next year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in The Blood of Dawnwalker gameplay overview below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1XOa0JYJv8g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1XOa0JYJv8g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"14th Century Europe. Bloody conflicts sweep the lands, and the Black Death comes for the survivors," the game's description reads. "Vampires seize the opportunity to walk out of the shadows and claim what they've been denied for centuries: freedom, and the power that comes with it. You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family. Whatever your choice, the question stands: is your soul worth the lives of those you love?"</p><p>Rebel Wolves describes The Blood of Dawnwalker as a "single-player open-world dark fantasy action-RPG with a strong focus on story and narrative." It is being developed on Unreal Engine 5 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and is set to launch sometime next year.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of The Blood of Dawnwalker so far?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Gearbox Software has released the first story trailer for its upcoming looter-shooter, Borderlands 4, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/19/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover">which is also the game gracing the next issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine</a>, and it highlights the new setting of Kairos, the four new Vault Hunters, the villainous Timekeeper, and more. Plus, it ends with details about the bonuses you'll get for preordering Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</p><p>"Get a glimpse of the Timekeeper's cruel reign, including the disturbing process of being implanted with a Bolt â€“ a spine-grafted cybernetic device used to dominate the populace," the trailer's description reads. "Soon after crash-landing, the Vault Hunters are arrested and forcibly affixed with the device, trapping them on Kairos."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Borderlands 4 story trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Timekeeper and his Order rule over Kairos from the impenetrable fortress location of Dominion City. When Elpis arrived in Kairos' orbit and unleashed cataclysmic destruction, the Timekeeper locked Dominion City down and sent in his commanders to handle the fallout. Today, the Timekeeper watches over Kairos from the safety of his tower, letting these Commanders maintain his Order, Gearbox says.&nbsp;</p><p>"From humble beginnings, you'll need to travel across Kairos and ignite the revolution against the Timekeeper," Gearbox says. "People all across Kairos have begun to rise up, and this powderkeg is set to explode. Enter Claptrap, self-proclaimed mastermind behind the Crimson Resistance, who's set on making the Vault Hunters his newest recruits."&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends with a look at the preorder bonuses for Borderlands 4, which you can view in the image below:&nbsp;</p>
