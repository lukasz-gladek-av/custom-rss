            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The third season of HBO's <em>The Last of Us</em> could be its last, despite showrunner <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/20/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-craig-mazin-says-theres-no-way-to-complete-this-narrative">Craig Mazin alluding to needing at least four seasons</a> to wrap up the story last year. That's according to HBO CEO and chairman Casey Bloys, who was asked by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/"><em>Deadline</em></a><em> </em>about speculation that <em>The Last of Us</em>'s third season will be its last.&nbsp;</p><p>"It certainly seems that way, but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners," Bloys told the publication. "So you can ask them."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps Bloys knows something everyone else doesn't, because last year, following the conclusion of season two of <em>The Last of Us</em>, Mazin said, "But certainly, there's no way to complete this narrative in a third season," adding, "Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That's the likely outcome." Maybe Bloys received word from Mazin that the third season will, in fact, be its last; otherwise, it's a bit odd to say, "It certainly seems that way."&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Bloys then said HBO defers to the showrunners, so if Mazin is still set on a fourth season, it sounds like that is also just as likely.&nbsp;</p><p>The third season of <em>The Last of Us </em>is due out on HBO sometime in 2027, though there's no word on exactly when. If it follows in the footsteps of the first two seasons, it could hit the streaming service in early 2027, but only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read about why my set visit to watch the cast and crew film the second season of <em>The Last of Us </em>was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2025/05/11/equal-parts-boring-and-intense-visiting-the-set-of-the-last-of-us">equal parts boring and intense</a>, and then read this interview to learn more about The Last of Us co-creator <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the">Neil Druckmann's thoughts on the creative process</a> behind making this TV show. After that, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle"><em>Game Informer's </em>review of The Last of Us Part II</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/"><em><strong>Deadline</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p><hr><p><em>Do you think HBO can wrap up the story in one more season of The Last of Us?
