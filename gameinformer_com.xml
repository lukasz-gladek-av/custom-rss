            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><strong>Update 7:56 p.m. ET:</strong> Wildlight Entertainment has released an <a href="https://x.com/wildlightent/status/2021745168387596450?s=46">official statement on social media</a> confirming the layoffs at the studio after several staff members began sharing news online that they had been let go. The studio also states that a "core group" of team members will continue to support Highguard, though it has not stated how the rollout of its content roadmap will be affected.</p><p>Wildlight's statement reads as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Developer Wildlight Entertainment released its free-to-play raid shooter, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/highguard">Highguard</a>, last month, on January 26, to mixed results. Now, just a few weeks after the game's launch, most of the team has reportedly been laid off. That's according to former Highguard level designer Alex Graner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">who posted on LinkedIn today</a>, stating, "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today."&nbsp;</p><p>In Graner's post, he says this layoff "really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard." If we take his words literally, it sounds like that content might never be released, which would be shocking but not unprecedented in this industry, which has been under constant disruption due to layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Highguard has been climbing a steep hill since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs">its reveal as the final "world premiere" at The Game Awards 2025</a> back in December. Its reveal didn't go over well with audiences, likely due to its placement as the closing spot during the awards ceremony and its difficult-to-parse style of FPS. Nonetheless, Wildlight released the game for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller called it a promising contender in his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/highguard/promising-contender">Highguard review</a>. Just last week,&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>covered the news of&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/06/highguard-episode-2-adds-a-ranked-mode-a-new-hero-and-map-and-more-today" target="_blank">Highguard's Episode 2 content drop</a>, which added a ranked mode, a new hero, another map, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>has reached out to Wildlight Entertainment to learn more about the layoffs Graner is referencing, how many team members were laid off, and more. This story will be updated if we learn more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/11/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-lays-off-most-of-the-team]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/news/2026/02/11/diablos-new-class-is-the-warlock-and-its-coming-to-diablo-ii-resurrected-today</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today’s Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight event, Blizzard announced the series’ newest class is the Warlock, and it’s coming to Diablo II: Resurrected, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo IV — each game featuring a unique interpretation of the demon-wielding archetype. While the Diablo team is holding back details of the Warlock’s class identity in Diablo IV’s Lord of Hatred expansion and Diablo Immortal, it is bringing the new character to Diablo II: Resurrected today via the new Reign of the Warlock DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>Diablo II’s rendition of the Warlock can summon three demons: the Tainted, the Defiler, and the Goatman. The class can also bind (read: tame) themself to almost any demon in the game, benefiting from its unique abilities. Additionally, the Warlock may choose to devour the bound demon, granting themself temporary buffs based on the consumed demon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Diablo Devs Explain New Warlock Class:</h2><p url="https://youtu.be/83jfLwGcZ8o" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83jfLwGcZ8o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“From the very get-go, it feels like such a natural extension of Diablo to have a character like the Warlock,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian tells me. “From a narrative perspective, Necromancers [...] are all about maintaining a balance. They’re almost neutral in tone and in how they think. [...] Warlocks, however, are more ostentatious [...] they’re very loud with all the things they do.”</p><p>“Mechanically, they’re actually very different from Necromancers, which are all about building up an army,” Haroutunian continues. “The Warlock doesn’t do that. [...] All the stuff he’s bringing in is disposable. He doesn’t actually care about them. They are just his tools, right?”</p>

<p>When asked how the disparate teams are differentiating the class’s abilities across three games (while still maintaining a unified theme), Haroutunian tells me that each team did whatever it needed to to make the Warlock fit their game. The associate game director likens the process to the creation of Diablo IV’s recent Paladin class and how his team distinguished it from Diablo II’s standard.</p><p>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock is available now on&nbsp;<a href="http://battle.net/">Battle.net</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/news/2026/02/11/diablos-new-class-is-the-warlock-and-its-coming-to-diablo-ii-resurrected-today]]></content:encoded>

The Warlock will join the already available Paladin in Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred when that expansion launches on April 28.&nbsp;</p>
