            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After a few years in a console's life cycle, its common to see dips in price for its older games and hardware, but in 2025, the opposite has been true. The latest culprit of the rising cost of gaming is Xbox Game Pass, which we learned today would be getting new features, but a massive increase in monthly fees. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">Ultimate, the highest tier of the service, will cost 50 percent more</a>, going from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month. A breakdown of the new tiers is included below.</p>
