Arguably one of the most interesting details about the game is that it is helmed by Masahiro Sakurai, the director of the Super Smash Bros. series, and the creator of Kirby. This will mark the first time Sakurai has actively worked a dedicated Kirby game since the original Kirby Air Rider in 2003.</p><p>The description for the YouTube location where the Direct will air promises an appearance from Sakurai reading, "Join us on Aug 19 at 6 a.m. PT for a Kirby Air Riders Direct with director Mr. Sakurai. The livestreamed presentation will last roughly 45 minutes and provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game."</p></div><p>Kirby Air Riders currently does not have a release date beyond the vague 2025.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/nintendo-is-holding-a-45-minute-kirby-air-riders-direct-on-tuesday]]></content:encoded>
