The game practically opens with the earth-shattering fight between the two gods, and Baldur continues to be a recurring antagonist throughout Kratos and his son <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/09/atreus-has-been-cast-in-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Atreus'</a> adventure to lay Faye, Kratos' wife and Atreus' mom, to rest on a mountain high in the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>You can check out that fight from the game in the video below, courtesy of <em>GameClips</em>:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rJBP0jz95M"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rJBP0jz95M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Charismatic, unpredictable, and armed with a razor-sharp tongue, Baldur lives by his own rules," <em>Deadline's </em>logline description of Baldur reads. "As a boy, Baldur was cursed; this curse denied him the ability to feel pleasure and physical sensation. This fuels an insatiable anger and bloodlust in Baldur, who favors a brawling fighting style that blends his immense power with the raw impact of his fists. Above all else, he longs for an opponent that can truly match his prowess in battle; an opponent that can finally make him feel something."&nbsp;</p><p>With Skrein's casting, the announced cast of Amazon's <em>God of War</em> series is as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> - Kratos</li><li><strong>Callum Vinson</strong> - Atreus</li><li><strong>Ed Skrein</strong> - Baldur</li><li><strong>Max Parker</strong> - Heimdall</li><li><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> - Thor</li><li><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong> - Odin</li><li><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> - Mimir</li><li><strong>Danny Woodburn</strong> - Brok</li><li><strong>Jeff Gulka</strong> - Sindri</li></ul><p>Amazon has already made a two-season order for <em>God of War </em>and is currently in pre-production in Vancouver, Canada. The series is being led by showrunner, writer, and executive producer Ronald D. Moore (<em>Outlander</em>, <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>).
