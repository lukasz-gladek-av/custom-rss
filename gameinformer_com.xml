            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Electronic Arts is being acquired for $55 billion by an investor consortium consisting of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The all-cash transaction sees this collective absorb 100 percent of the publisher, effectively taking the company private.</p><p>The transaction is the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history, said to “accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment,” according to a <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release</a>. The deal was approved by the EA’s board of directors and is expected to close during Q1 of the 2027 fiscal year, pending customary regulatory approvals.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the acquisition is complete, EA will stay headquartered in Redwood City, California, and Andrew Wilson will remain CEO. Stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash, representing a 25 percent premium to the unaffected share price ($168.32 at market close on September 25, 2025). Following the acquisition, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said Andrew Wilson in a press release. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>

<p>The acquisition group, dubbed “The Consortium,” consists of three companies. First is the PIF, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. The PIF has expanded its reach into the video game industry through its Savvy Games Group, an entity founded in 2021. In the last four years, the PIF has purchased stakes in gaming companies such as Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive, Capcom, Embracer Group, and Nexon. The Savvy Games Group also owns American mobile gaming company Scopley, and earlier this year, announced plans to acquire the game division of Pokémon Go developer Niantic. The PIF had an existing stake in EA before its full acquisition of the company.</p><p>The second company is Silver Lake, a multi-billion-dollar global technology investment firm based in North America, Europe, and Asia. Lastly, Affinity Partners is a Miami-based investment firm founded in 2021 by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, who once served as White House senior advisor during Trump's first term.</p><p>The Consortium states it will “bring deep sector experience, committed capital, and global portfolios with networks across gaming, entertainment, and sports that offer unique possibilities for EA to blend physical and digital experiences, enhance fan engagement, and create new growth opportunities.”</p>

<p>The acquisition comes as EA gears up for the October 10 launch of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/01/familiar-yet-cinematic">Battlefield 6</a>, which is shaping up to be its biggest release of the year. EA’s portfolio of upcoming titles also includes<a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/everything-announced-at-the-july-nintendo-partner-direct"> Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, next year’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/19/star-wars-zero-company-details-first-screenshots-emerge-from-star-wars-celebration-japan">Star Wars Zero Company</a>, and more distant projects such as the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/mass-effect-lives-on-with-bioware-tease-of-liaras-return">next Mass Effect</a>, a third Star Wars Jedi title, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/19/motive-studios-single-player-iron-man-game-being-developed-in-unreal-engine-5">Motive Studios’ Iron Man</a>.</p><p>It also comes after two years of massive layoffs across EA.
