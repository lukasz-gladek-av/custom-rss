Plus, the patch features a large list of bug fixes, too.</p><p>Nightreign launched last week, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-hits-2-million-players-in-just-one-day">bringing in an impressive 2 million players in less than 24 hours</a>. It didn’t take long for players to realize embarking on solo expeditions is incredibly difficult, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">something I noted in my Nightreign review</a>. Publisher Bandai Namco announced last week that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-coming-next-week-to-make-solo-expeditions-easier">an upcoming patch would address that</a>, and now that <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">patch</a> is live.</p><p height="360" width="640"

allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For solo players, the patch adds the “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat” effect, which allows revival once per night boss battle, to the game and increases the amount of runes gained.</p><p>General balance adjustments that all players will feel are an increase in the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward when reaching Day 3 of any expedition, and an increase in the probability of obtaining high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar in the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>Elsewhere in the patch, From Software has fixed a large number of bugs, which you can view below:</p><ul><li>Adjusted camera behavior when activating the Guardian's Ultimate Art, “Wings of Salvation.”</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Duchess's Character Skill “Restage” where Status Ailments would not trigger when built up from other players' attacks.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks of Raider with Greataxe and Great Hammer weapon types had higher damage than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some “Those Who Live in Death “ enemies would revive when &nbsp;defeated with the “Sacred Blade” skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the “Bleeding” Status Ailment would not build up when the Skill “Bloody Slash” hit an enemy.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the “Ghostflame Ignition” attack would not occur under certain circumstances.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the status ailment “Frostbite” would not build up when the light wave released by a strong attack hit an enemy while the “Moonlight Greatsword” skill was active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the speed of arrows fired with the “Mighty Shot” and “Enchanted Shot” skills was slower than expected.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the attack range of the magic spell “Rock Sling” was longer than expected when using it with a staff equipped in the left hand.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the effect of reducing the maximum HP of enemies when the incantation “Black Blade” hit them was not activated.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Passive Effect "Successive Attacks Negate Damage" &nbsp;would stack when successive attacks were made while the Effect was active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some Passive Effects were not displaying their effects at the correct values.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Relic Special Effect “[Guardian] Become the target of enemy aggression when ability is activated” would not activate under certain situations.</li><li>Fixed a bug where certain effects were not being applied to Relics obtained from Expedition Rewards or purchased from the Small Jar Bazaar.</li><li>Fixed a bug where items that could be obtained upon completing a Remembrance in the Remembrance world when the scenario conditions were met could not be obtained when changing characters and concluding a Remembrance.</li><li>Fixed bugs in the behavior and specifications of certain attacks and actions of specific enemies.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused the game to become unstable under certain conditions during battles with specific enemies.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the graphics rendering during battles with specific enemies.</li><li>Fixed some incorrect information in the staff credits.</li><li>Fixed some text.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some sound effects were not playing correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the “Exit Remembrance” effect was not displayed during a “Wylder” Remembrance on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the HUD was not displayed on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the game would crash under certain circumstances on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Expeditions and reconnecting to sessions would fail under certain circumstances on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where background music

“Graphics” (Steam only).</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Climb up action sometimes failed when using the keyboard (Steam only).</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Climb up action was difficult to perform when using a gamepad (Steam only).</li></ul><p>This update, Ver. 1.01.1, is available now and is required for anyone wishing to play Nightreign online.</p><p>While waiting for the game to update, read

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/02/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-announces-layoffs-due-to-suspended-projects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sebastian Wojciechowski, CEO of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/outriders">Outriders</a> studio People Can Fly, has announced on LinkedIn that the studio is laying off staff due to having to suspend two in-development games known as projects Gemini and Bifrost. Wojciechowski lays the blame for Gemini’s suspension on an unnamed publisher.</p><p>“The Suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project,” Wojciechowski writes in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/people-can-fly_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334906069715972096-lZaD/?utm_medium=ios_app&amp;rcm=ACoAAAYfKcgBmkwkz8uDkAWf33eVkUhw6ZP7Mco&amp;utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_campaign=copy_link">update</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBALmH4BkQA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBALmH4BkQA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The CEO then explains that a second project, Bifrost, has also been suspended due to the same publisher issue that caused Gemini’s suspension, adding that an “analysis of the Group’s cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue this production and release of this project,” is also behind Bifrost’s suspension.</p><p>“As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most,” Wojciechowski writes. “We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone’s contribution up to this point.”</p><p>People Can Fly has been around for over two decades, with credits on games like Gears of War, Bulletstorm, and Gears of War: Judgment. It also developed 2021’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/outriders/outriders-review-chaos-that-surprises-in-the-best-way">Outriders</a>, a third-person looter shooter published by Square Enix. It is unclear which publisher Wojciechowski is referencing in today’s update, as projects Gemini and Bifrost were unannounced games the studio was working on.</p><p>Elsewhere, People Can Fly is co-developing The Coalition’s upcoming prequel, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-is-a-prequel-set-14-years-before-the-first-game">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, and first-person survival shooter Lost Rift.</p><hr><p><em>The hearts of the Game Informer staff are with everyone who’s been affected by these layoffs.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
