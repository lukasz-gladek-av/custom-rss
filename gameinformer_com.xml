The trailer mainly showcases the relationship between the protagonist and a mysterious girl with technological powers who rides on his back, but it opens with a mysterious trailer for a fictional tech company called Delphi. You can watch it for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The game appears to be a third-person action game, and in the footage shown today, we see that you play as a man in a futuristic astronaut suit – think NASA body with an Iron Man mask. In a mostly-isolated space station on what appears to be Earth's moon, this protagonist has to battle a legion of robots using a pistol and handy gadgets built into his suit, like an attachment that lets him ride up walls, or jets on his waist that allow him to dodge and hover.</p><p dir="ltr">The star of the trailer, however, is D-I-03367, better known as Diana, who calls herself a "state-of-the-art Pragmata," which seems to be another word for a human-like android, capable of hacking and harnessing technology by pointing at it. In the trailer, we see her stun enemies and override doors, which is likely just the tip of the iceberg for her capabilities in the main game.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer ends with what seems like an apology for the last time we saw the game – the note Diana wrote delaying its release is erased and replaced by a new launch window: 2026. Hopefully, that date sticks this time.

It's called Romeo is a Dead Man and is due out sometime in 2026. Suda 51 describes it as an "ultra-violent science fiction" action game in which you play as Romeo Stargazer, an FBI investigator who tracks down wanted criminals across spacetime.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, it's a gore-filled, bloody action game with lots of swords, guns, and heads to explode, with some wild-looking enemies to boot. Romeo, himself, is a mysterious protagonist, but Suda 51 says there will be more to share in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Romeo is a Dead Man reveal trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Romeo is a Dead Man is set to launch in 2026, though the trailer teases that 2026 is a "maybe."&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you excited for Romeo is a Dead Man?
