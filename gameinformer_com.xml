            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-2042/battlefield-2042-review-the-battle-of-the-bugs">the bug-riddled launch of Battlefield 2042</a> back in 2021, EA has been working to revitalize the Battlefield series’ name, placing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/respawns-vince-zampella-becomes-head-of-battlefield-amidst-wider-franchise-changes-that">Respawn’s Vince Zampella as its head amidst the creation of a wider Battlefield universe</a>. If the recent Battlefield 6 beta over the weekend is any indication, those efforts are paying off. Not only did the beta surpass Call of Duty’s all-time player count, but it also reached a new concurrent peak for the Battlefield series.&nbsp;</p><p>EA calls the Battlefield 6 open beta <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/lock-and-load-for-the-open-beta">its biggest ever</a>, and Weekend 1 (Aug. 9-10) just wrapped up. Throughout the weekend, and on Aug. 7 and Aug. 8, when invite-only players could hop in early, I saw screenshots across social media showing queues stretching into the hundreds of thousands – a lot of people were playing this game.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Using SteamDB, a database that tracks Steam concurrent player counts, that checks out. On Saturday, the Battlefield 6 open beta peaked with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079 players</a>, which is also an all-time peak for the entire Battlefield series. That number eclipses <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">the peak of Call of Duty at 491,670, </a>too, though it’s important to note these are just Steam numbers and console players could sway this observation in either direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the point stands – Battlefield 6 is something players are excited about. The real test will be how many of these open beta (see: free) players will convert into paid players when Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31">watch the Battlefield 6 debut trailer</a> and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/01/familiar-yet-cinematic">our preview of Battlefield 6’s multiplayer</a> after going hands-on with it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Did you hop into the Battlefield 6 open beta this weekend?
