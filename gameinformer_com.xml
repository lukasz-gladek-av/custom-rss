Aphelion is the latest from Don't Nod, and it is leaning decidedly science-ficiton. The game appears to follow two astronauts who crash-land on an alien planet. It is also being developed in partnership with The European Space Agency.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZs_IthEb2s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZs_IthEb2s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Aphelion is coming to Xbox platforms, PC, and PlayStation 5 next year. It was odd to see a PlayStation logo on screen during an Xbox showcase, but not entirely surprising considering how platform-agnostic Xbox has become in recent years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s clear that success was not lost on the game makers, as today brought the announcement of Grounded 2, a brand new game in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Grounded 2 follows up on the premise of the original game, this time seeing the adventurous kids navigating a local park, riding ants, running along picnic tables and fallen popsicles, and battling a bevy of spiders and scorpions.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Grounded 2 is closer than you might expect for a newly announced project; expect it to arrive to Xbox Game Preview on July 29.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s great to see the early success of the franchise be rewarded with another entry, though we’re left to wonder how Obsidian is staying on top of so many projects. With <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/avowed/high-fun-per-square-foot">Avowed earlier this year</a>, Grounded 2 in Game Preview this summer, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/the-outer-worlds-2-targets-fall-release">The Outer Worlds 2 now set for October</a>, that development house has had a very busy year.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But perhaps what's even more surprising than Xbox finally diving into the handheld race is the reveal that Hollow Knight Silksong, one of the most anticipated games of every year since its announcement, will be coming to the console at launch this holiday.</p><p>The showcase might still show off a proper trailer for Team Cherry's metroidvania sequel, but as it stands, all we saw was some new clips of protagonist Hornet platforming through a dangerous-looking area full of spinning blades and acrobatically attacking various bug-shaped enemies.</p>

<p>The game was at an Xbox summer showcase three years ago, when it was promised to launch sometime within the next 12 months. It was obviously delayed. The last time we saw it, however, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d70c00a-ace5-4c4a-a1c2-b92d36666a68" data-entity-substitution="canonical">was at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, when we learned it would be coming out later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>It's worth noting that the trailer didn't say the game would be launching with the Xbox handheld, just that "it will be available at launch," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond. This means the game could launch any time between then and now, but whenever the Xbox handheld has a release date, we'll know Silksong is due out before then.&nbsp;</p><p>At the very least, it sounds like Team Cherry is doubling down on 2025, so if it doesn't launch this year, it will be more surprising than ever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
