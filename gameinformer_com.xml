            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo revealed <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/nintendo-reveals-mario-tennis-fever-launches-on-switch-2-in-february">Mario Tennis Fever, a Switch 2 exclusive, during a Direct</a> that aired last September. Now, with roughly a month to go until <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mario-tennis-fever">the game's February 12 release date</a>, the company has released a new overview trailer highlighting nearly 6 minutes of gameplay, including a look at the series' largest roster of playable characters.&nbsp;</p><p>That's because Mario Tennis Fever features 38 different characters, ranging from fan-favorites like Mario and Luigi to more mischievous players like Dry Bones and Baby Waluigi. Alongside those 38 characters, Mario Tennis Fever features 30 Fever Rackets, which are all-new to the series and allow you to equip your character with unique abilities. The Ice Racket, for example, turns parts of the court into a slippery tundra, while the Mini Mushroom Racket shrinks your opponent to bite size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Just fill up your Fever Gauge to unleash a Fever Shot," a press release reads. "And if you're on the receiving end of one, don't worry – you can try and send it back at your opponent before the shot hits the court, so they feel the effects instead." That's an especially useful skill to learn when up against rackets like the Shadow Racket, which causes the receiving player to see double as it duplicates the player using the racket.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check all this out and more in the Mario Tennis Fever overview trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mario Tennis Fever will feature a single-player Adventure Mode, a campaign in which mysterious monsters turn Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies, forcing them to re-master their tennis skills and overcome challenges to return to normal. Elsewhere in the game, the Trial Towers mode forces players to take on a series of challenges as they climb their way to the top of a tower, and Mix It Up mode allows you to play matches with unconventional rules, like Ring Shot, where you have to hit balls with precision through rings to earn points and Forest Court Match, where you can expand the court's size by feeding Piranha Plants tennis balls.&nbsp;</p><p>Returning modes include Tournament, with play-by-play commentary from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/getting-its-flowers">Super Mario Bros. Wonder's</a> Talking Flower, and online modes like Online Room for casual play with customizable rules and Ranked Matches, where you can play against players around the world. There's even a Swing Mode where you gently swing your Joy-Con 2 controller to hit different kinds of shots.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> launches exclusively on Switch 2 on February 12.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/nintendo-reveals-mario-tennis-fever-launches-on-switch-2-in-february">check out the Mario Tennis Fever reveal trailer</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-tennis-aces/a-successful-return-serve"><em>Game Informer's </em>Mario Tennis Aces review</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/08/new-mario-tennis-fever-trailer-highlights-the-biggest-roster-of-playable-characters-in]]></content:encoded>
