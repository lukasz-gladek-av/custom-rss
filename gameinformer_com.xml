It will put players in the shoes of the Sea Scorpion pirate leader when it launches in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, Resonance brings players to Sophia's past, promising a look at how we got to where she is in Requiem. She looks much younger in this spinoff, suggesting it happens a good bit earlier than the events of Requiem, and the game's tagline teases some more mythical chaos. "Unravel ancient secrets, and confront a mythical creature at the heart of a devastating curse," it reads. "Plunge into Sophia's original story in Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy reveal trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Though it seems Resonance will take place before the rest of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/a-plague-tale-innocence">Asobo Studio's A Plague Tale series</a>, it's still worth your time to check out the first two games.
