<p>"When federal agents threaten his family, former outlaw John Marston is forced to hunt down the gang of criminals he once called friends," the app store's description reads. "Experience Marston's journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico as he fights to bury his blood-stained past in the critically acclaimed predecessor to the 2018 blockbuster, Red Dead Redemption 2."&nbsp;</p><p>Though the game is a mobile port, it actually looks pretty decent, probably the result of the original game launching back in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>It's currently available on those launch platforms – PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 – and you can also play it on PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S (via backwards compatibility), Switch, and PC. Following a recent ESRB rating for the game on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m5jevcwfck2r" target="_blank">Wario64 on Bluesky</a>, fans expected an announcement for those platforms soon. However, it seems Netflix is next up as the new place to play Red Dead Redemption.&nbsp;</p><p>Red Dead Redemption is coming to iOS and Android on December 4.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/red_dead_redemption/b/xbox360/archive/2010/05/17/review.aspx">Red Dead Redemption</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/red-dead-redemption-ii/an-open-world-western-for-the-ages">Red Dead Redemption II</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to try out Red Dead Redemption on your phone?

<p>"Announced in front of a packed auditorium at the Disney+ Originals Preview at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, executive producer of the series’ Hideo Kojima, and the series’ director Takayuki Sano, appeared on stage to announce that their first ever partnership with a global streaming platform will be with Disney+ and that the latest expansion of the Death Stranding franchise will be an animated series," according to the announcement post. "New concept art created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045</em>, was also revealed along with the <em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> (working title) announcement."</p><p><strong>Here's the full synopsis of </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Isolations</strong></em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Once, there was an explosion...</em></p><p><em>Lonesome souls of the dead manifest in the physical world, reaching in search of the living. However, the connection they create triggers a massive explosion that eradicates anything of this world—a phenomenon referred to as the Death Stranding. These events wipe out nations as well as civilization itself. People who remain are now isolated, withdrawn, and without connections. As humanity stands at the brink a legendary porter set out to transport both cargo and wishes of its senders, reconnecting people in the hope that they might still be saved.</em></p><p><em>Based on the video game born out of the mind of legendary game creator, Hideo Kojima, comes a new animation series headed by Japan’s up-and-coming animation studio E&amp;H production. Helmed by E&amp;H’s Takayuki Sano, it follows in the footsteps of the original in spirit and ideas and depict the world of Death Stranding through a bold and yet subtle touch and top-class hand-drawn animation. &nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. An old man trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior who tries to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy with a grudge against Bridges. A girl who embraces loneliness.</em></p><p><em>On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</em></p><p><em>And now, comes another explosion...&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> is the current working title, so the series' name could change, but when it premieres, it will do so on the Disney+ streaming service in 2027. <em>Isolations</em> is not to be confused with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/23/death-stranding-animated-film-announced"><em>Death Stranding: Mosquito</em></a> (working title), which is an animated film set in the Death Stranding universe currently in the works, or <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/death-stranding-movie-lands-the-director-of-a-quiet-place-day-one">the live-action Death Stranding movie A24 is creating</a> with <em>A Quiet Place: Day One </em>director Michael Sarnoski.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding/death-stranding-review-the-wanderer">Death Stranding</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/boundless-sincerity-aside-flaws">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What kind of story do you hope Isolations tells? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2025/11/13/death-stranding-isolations-is-an-original-anime-series-coming-to-disney-in]]></content:encoded>
