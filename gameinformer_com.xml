            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Fire Emblem is back, and for the first time, it's launching on Switch 2. Fortune's Weave, the latest in the series, centers around a coliseum, which seems to hold the "heroic games," but if we know anything about the series, this seemingly friendly competition will eventually devolve into a massive war between kingdoms. You can check out the reveal trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer focuses on four main characters. Cai (the apparent protagonist based on the fact that we see him freely roaming around the city), says, "I only want to fight so I can save my father's life," making him an unwilling participant in the game. Meanwhile, Theodora boasts about her strength and hopes to be a worthy queen, Deitrich (who looks a lot like Castlevania's Alucard) wants to confront some kind of darkness, and Leda is on a quest for revenge so intense that killing her foe isn't enough. It seems that the winner of the games will get a wish granted by the kingdom's "divine sovereign," which tracks, given that the titular Fire Emblem is typically an artifact that grants one's wishes.</p><p>The trailer ends with what appears to be Sothis, the magical girl in the player's head in Three Houses, now an adult. She remarks on the years being long, and given that it's been six years since Three Houses hit Switch, I'm inclined to agree. The trailer ends with a release window: 2026. I'm a huge fan of both <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/fire-emblem-three-houses/head-of-the-class">Three Houses</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/fire-emblem-engage/propelling-to-the-future-using-the-past">Engage</a>, so I'm excited to learn more about Fortune's Weave next year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-comes-to-switch-2-in-2026]]></content:encoded>
