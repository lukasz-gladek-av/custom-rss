            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>On March 4, it was announced that defunct publisher Acclaim had been resurrected (again), this time as an indie publisher. After months of waiting, it's time to learn what new games will bear that iconic rainbow logo thanks to the publisher's first digital showcase.</p><p>On September 10, Acclaim will host the Play Acclaim showcase to reveal its lineup of upcoming titles. The news follows a series of teaser trailers posted to the publisher’s official YouTube channel (such as the one below), which is where the presentation will be broadcast. Play Acclaim will air at 11:30 a.m. PT/2:30 p.m. ET.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Acclaim was a household name in the ‘80s and ‘90s as a publisher for many well-known games and franchises, including Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, Turok, numerous WWE titles, and even more licensed games. The publisher closed its doors in 2004 due to poor sales and failure to pay royalties to its licensors. The brand was acquired and revived in 2006 as Acclaim Games, a totally different entity focused on offering free online games from other territories. Acclaim Games was then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/08/28/acclaim-shuts-its-doors-again.aspx">shuttered in 2010</a>.</p><p>This revived Acclaim will focus on the independent game scene, promising to provide funding, marketing, and PR support to smaller studios. Acclaim’s advisory board consists of Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and pro wrestler Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p><p>“We’re not here to chase ghosts,” said Alex Josef, CEO of Acclaim in today’s press release. “We’re here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what’s coming through is something exciting and different.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/26/the-newly-revived-acclaim-is-hosting-a-showcase-next-month]]></content:encoded>
