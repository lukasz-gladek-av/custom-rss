            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’re approaching the 2nd anniversary of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2023/07/13/surviving-made-easier">Enshrouded</a>’s early access launch on January 24, and developer Keen Games is marking the occasion by revealing the game’s 1.0 launch window. While we already knew the survival action RPG would exit early access this year, that timeframe has been narrowed to sometime this fall.</p><p>Until then, Keen Games has released a developer diary where it discusses plans for one last major content update for the early access build. While the details of this update are under wraps, Adventure Sharing, which lets players share creations with the community, will be one of the additions.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV1NAq47R50" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Enshrouded hits 1.0, new areas of the map will be unlocked, as will a more advanced version of Adventure Sharing. Building systems will also receive new features and improvements. Keen Games also promises to improve combat by adding more technical depth, better enemy behavior and variety, and reworked balancing. Keen will continue optimizing the game post-launch, specifically calling out shader compilation as one key area of improvement. Lastly, Enshrouded is coming to consoles upon launching in 1.0, though it does not specify platforms.</p><p>The team has also touched on Enshrouded’s evolving content roadmap for the year. While we don't get a fleshed-out schedule of confirmed updates, Keen does state that post-launch updates will include paid expansions as well as free content drops. &nbsp;Additionally, the game will receive a patch tomorrow that will add combat tweaks, such as modifying damage number visibility, adjusting blocking/parry animations and telegraphy, and improving projectile spells/attack accuracy. This patch will also introduce a new vanity armor set, make randomly exploding barrels do so less frequently, and include other bug fixes that players can read in the patch notes.</p><p>Enshrouded has been coming together for two years and has undergone significant changes since its Early Access release in 2024. Since then, it has garnered over five million players playing as Flameborn and fighting to uncover the remnants of the fallen and corrupted land of Embervale. It will be curious to see how big a splash Enshrouded makes once it launches in full, and players on PC and console can find out once autumn rolls around.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/21/enshrouded-goes-10-this-fall-as-keen-games-discusses-2026-content-roadmap]]></content:encoded>
