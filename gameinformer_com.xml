            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>ProbablyMonsters, the studio behind last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/storm-lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, has revealed Nekome: Nazi Hunter, a third-person action game where – you guessed it – you kill a lot of nazis. The game's release date and playable platforms remain to be announced, but if the idea of getting revenge against nazi soldiers during World War II sounds like a great time, it's a game you might want to keep an eye on.&nbsp;</p><p>"In Nekome: Nazi Hunter, players step into the role of Vano Nastasu, a young Romani man consumed by grief after the brutal murder of his family by nazi soldiers," a press release reads. "The game follows Vano's transformation from hunter to hunter as he embarks on a violent personal odyssey of revenge across war-torn Europe."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Nekome: Nazi Hunter announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfi7rGaz3gg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfi7rGaz3gg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>ProbablyMonsters says its game approaches the Second World War from a personal perspective, as you play as Vano, a man not trying to end the war (though I imagine he'd like to do that), but set on exacting revenge on every nazi he comes across. To do so, players will "scout enemy routes, plan their assaults, and strike with precision in a mix of stealth and brutal, up-close combat." If the trailer above is any indication, the combat is indeed brutal, violent, and bloody.&nbsp;</p><p>The studio says Nekome: Nazi Hunter's visuals are inspired by grindhouse cinema and that the game features visceral combat, complete with grounded finishing moves. Though the announcement trailer is short, the screenshots below might give you a better look at what to expect in the game:&nbsp;</p><p>More information about Nekome: Nazi Hunter will be released at GDC next month.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Nekome: Nazi Hunter's reveal?
