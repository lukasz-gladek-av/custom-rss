This trailer highlights the characters of Slavic mythology, like the massive black cat Bayun, the forest guardian Leshy, and other "names not spoken in years." There's no release date for the game yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam starting today.&nbsp;</p><p>Chains of Lukomorye comes from Forge Ahead Games, a small European indie studio. This is the game's cinematic announcement trailer, though it does feature snippets of gameplay that look promising. Forge Ahead Games describes the game as a haunting third-person shooter that explores love, grief, and the thin line between fate and free will. It also says the game will be playable solo or in online co-op, "as you descend into an alternate post-WWI world where Allied experiments shattered reality itself."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Chains of Lukomorye reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSwdVStJyf8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSwdVStJyf8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"The ritual ended the war but cracked the world," a description of the game reads. "Myths seep into broken trenches and forgotten villages, and something ancient stirs in the dark. Journey through deserted trenches and enchanted ruins to rescue a lost love from the Slavic Underworld."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the screenshots below for another look at Chains of Lukomorye:</strong>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Chains of Lukomorye's reveal trailer?
