            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Koijima Productions' Beyond the Strand presentation revealed a few new details for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away">Physint</a>, the studio’s in-development action espionage title. Although studio head Hideo Kojima said earlier this year that the project was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away">at least five years away from release</a>, he unveiled a piece of key art along with some of its celebrity voice talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima reiterates that Physint, which was first revealed during a January 2024 State of Play, is in the conceptual stages. However, he says the game’s technology will be more advanced than Kojima Productions' upcoming horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>. While we don’t see any in-game footage, Kojima revealed a Physint poster showing off the game’s protagonist.</p>

<p>While Kojima has not yet cast the main character, he does reveal three film actors playing unknown supporting roles: Charlee Fraser (<em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Anyone But You</em>), Ma Dong-seok AKA Don Lee (<em>Train to Busan, Eternals</em>), and Minami Hamabe (<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>). Kojima then shared images of Hamabe rendered in-engine, showing off the technology's impressive realism.&nbsp;</p><p>Physint has no release window, but it will be coming to PlayStation platforms (likely Sony's next-generation console).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/hades-ii-launches-into-10-on-switch-2-switch-and-pc-this-month" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96f5a186-90d9-4225-bdea-99efab207a75" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Hades II may hit this week</a>, but that isn't stopping developer Super Evil Megacorp from putting out new content inspired by Supergiant's hugely successful series. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate/radical-repetition">finally made the leap from Apple Arcade to consoles last year</a>, takes several cues from Hades, but wraps it in the shells of Eastman and Laird's iconic Turtles. Earlier this year, the mask-wearing Casey Jones joined the playable roster of characters in the isometric roguelike, and now, it's Metalhead's turn.</p><p>A robotic turtle built by Donatello, Metalhead is the sixth playable character and delivers an all-new playstyle to the game. He operates as the longest-range character on the roster to date, with a laser gun, explosive landmines, and tactical skills designed to keep enemies at a distance. The story introduces Metalhead by having him accidentally open a rift under a pizzeria, and it's up to the team to stop the chaos that spills out of the rift. Additionally, the paid DLC adds five new artifacts to let you further experiment with your builds.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXGD8H4X0KI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the paid Metalhead DLC, all players will have access to a free title update that adds an Arcade mode, new levels, a new storyline, additional powers, enemies, visual upgrades, and tuning. Arcade mode offers a fast-paced way to experience the content alone or with friends, complete with a new Hex and Flex system, which adds new variables to account for during a run; some combos you unlock will weaken you (Hexes), while others will make you stronger (Flexes). The update also adds three new biomes – the Spectral Sewers, Astral Ship, and Manic Metropolis – a new Wraith enemy set, and Enemy Invasion mechanics that unlock new encounter combinations. These updates stack with more than 100 gameplay and quality-of-life improvements, including visual polish and balancing adjustments.</p><p>Both the Metalhead paid DLC and the free update hit all versions on September 30.
