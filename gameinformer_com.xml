            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ghost of Yōtei is one of our most anticipated games of the year. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/10/ghost-of-yotei-has-new-director-modes-inspired-by-miike-and-watanabe-and-lots-lots-more">Thanks to today's State of Play livestream</a>, we learned a lot more about the game, including its new combat, its beautiful open world, its new director modes, and much more. The game looks like something special, and Sony is seemingly on the same page, opting to release two limited edition PlayStation 5 consoles on the same day as the game.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgM6poO2JmY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgM6poO2JmY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There are two versions of the console. One has a white base with gold design across it, mimicking a Japanese art practice known as kintsugi, where cracked pottery is repaired with lacquer and gold, highlighting the fact that it shattered. It mirrors Atsu's onryō mask, which has seemingly undergone the same process. The bundle also includes a controller with a similar design. If the gold isn't to your taste, there's a white and black version instead, which is meant to mimic Sumi-e, an art style defined by brush strokes of black ink.</p><p>These bundles will include the disc drive version of the console along with a digital copy of Ghost of Yōtei Standard Edition, complete with pre-order content, an in-game mask, and seven PSN avatars of Atsu and each of the Yōtei Six.</p><p>If you already own a PlayStation 5 but still like the design, you can instead purchase console covers for the slim or pro models, which will be available on&nbsp;<a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">direct.playstation.com</a>. The covers, however, are not available for the base model PS5, and if you want the black covers, you'll have to buy a whole new console. Meanwhile, both versions of the controller will be available as a standalone purchase.</p><p>The PS5 bundles, controllers, console covers, and Ghost of Yōtei will all be available on October 2, later this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/10/sucker-punch-announces-ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-bundles-controllers-and-console]]></content:encoded>
