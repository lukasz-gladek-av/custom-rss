<p>Ubisoft Halifax was formerly known as Longtail Studios. Founded in 2010, it worked on Rocksmith 2014 before being <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/10/14/ubisoft-purchases-studio-that-worked-on-rocksmith-2014.aspx">acquired by Ubisoft in 2015</a>. The studio went on to help develop the mobile titles <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_rebellion/b/ios/archive/2017/06/27/build-your-own-assassin-brotherhood-in-the-new-free-to-play-strategy-rpg.aspx">Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</a>, released in 2018, and Rainbow Six Mobile, which launches on February 23.&nbsp;</p><p>This news follows a challenging couple of years for the publisher, which has made significant cuts at studios such as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-massive-initiates-voluntary-buyouts">Massive Entertainment</a> (The Division, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora) and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">RedLynx</a> (Trials) as part of its ongoing restructuring. Last March, it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">formed a new subsidiary</a> partially backed by Tencent called Vantage Studios to manage its biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio]]></content:encoded>
