            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been nearly four years since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-announced-by-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7f08d7-a850-4def-a34c-dea649945f96" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Ubisoft announced its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the developer doesn't have much to show off quite yet, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/11/17/new-splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-and-details-revealed-in-anniversary-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d24df20a-5973-4edd-9a2e-bb04b04c2d46" data-entity-substitution="canonical">outside of a few pieces of concept art</a>. Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA.</p><p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!" <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACOWhuwBwYrSgCaAXycFQL8Ess7nITKi_yU">Grivel's LinkedIn post announcing the news reads</a>. "A very special team and project to me," the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em>, which noticed this post before we did.</a>)</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin's Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting.</p><p>Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it's unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it's a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here's hoping we'll see a more concrete update sometime soon.</p><p>[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/game-director-david-grivel-rejoins-splinter-cell-remake-after-leaving-in-late-2022]]></content:encoded>
