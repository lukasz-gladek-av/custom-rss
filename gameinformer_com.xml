            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo announced this morning that a number of its products' prices are changing beginning August 3. Specifically, the OLED Switch model, standard Switch model, Switch Lite, Switch accessories, certain Switch 2 accessories, some Amiibo, and Alarmo will be receiving price changes.</p><p>In its statement, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">which you can read in full here</a>, Nintendo never specifically says prices will go up, but it is safe to assume that will be the case. If the prices were going down, the announcement would have been celebratory and probably appeared on the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/future-nintendo-and-switch-2-news-will-arrive-via-new-nintendo-today-app">Nintendo Today app</a>. It wouldn't have been a no-frills post buried on its news website.</p><p>However, the statement does specify that the Switch 2 console, physical and digital Switch and Switch 2 games, and Nintendo Switch Online memberships will all remain consistent "at this time." That's good news given that Nintendo had already <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories</a> before taking pre-orders in the US due to the economic environment stemming from US tariffs.&nbsp;</p><p>The price adjustment news comes on the heels of Nintendo sharing a separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">three-month earnings report statement</a>. In it, Nintendo reiterated that it had sold 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the four days following the launch, and has reached over <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">6 million units</a> in the seven weeks after release day. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 5.63 million units. Though mentioned in its report as one of Switch 2's launch games, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour/homework-the-video-game">Welcome Tour's</a> sales numbers were not specified.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-changing-but-not-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection is the latest retrospective compilation by <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration/a-half-century-of-gaming-history-stuffed-into-an">Atari 50</a> and The Making of Karateka developer, Digital Eclipse. Bundling the earliest MK titles across arcade, console, and handheld, it’s shaping up to be a robust offering for diehard fans. During EVO 2025, the fan-favorite Mortal Kombat Trilogy was also confirmed for the title.</p><p>Mortal Kombat Trilogy was released in 1996 and is the final version of Mortal Kombat 3 (following Ultimate MK 3) that boasted every character and stage from previous games up to that point. Trilogy introduced Brutalities, a combo-focused alternative to Fatalities that has only resurfaced in the modern MK games, and the short-lived Aggressor Bar, which grants fighters increased speed and damage when filled. Trilogy was available on PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, PC, and even Tiger's R-Zone headset/handheld, but Digital Eclipse has not yet confirmed which version(s) of the game will be included in Legacy Kollection.&nbsp;</p><p>Trilogy joins the growing list of games in the Kollection, which includes multiple versions of Mortal Kombat 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as handheld entries, such as the Game Boy Advance titles. Several games now boast online multiplayer with rollback netcode. The Legacy Kollection also features a new interactive documentary (a Digital Eclipse trademark) detailing MK's history with over 25 interview subjects, including creators Ed Boon and John Tobias.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital Eclipse also announced that Legacy Kollection will be released in physical editions for consoles and PC. This will come in three forms: Standard, Deluxe, and Kollector’s Edition.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZ_pJv5wk8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZZ_pJv5wk8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> ($59.99) consists of the base game. Those who pre-order also receive one of four exclusive ninja-themed slipcovers based on Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Smoke. The physical Standard Edition is available for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and Switch. It will ship on December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> ($79.99) packs in a steelbook case, magnet, poster, lenticular card, arcade flyers, mini-marquees, and arcade cabinet cards. This edition is only available for PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Switch and will ship on December 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the <strong>Kollector’s Edition </strong>($149.99) includes all the previous goodies plus a Goro controller holder statue, a commemorative arcade token, a hardcover art and lore book, and a Scorpion/Sub-Zero pin set. This edition is available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC. There is currently no shipping date for the Kollector's Edition.&nbsp;</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection still doesn’t have a release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
