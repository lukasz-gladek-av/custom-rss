This will bring the currently PC-exclusive game to a console for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>Inzoi launched into Early Access on Steam back in March, surpassing 1 million sales in its first week. Krafton says all of Inzoi's systems and features on PC will appear in the PS5 version, reworked specifically for console. Ahead of the game's PS5 release next year, though, Inzoi will launch on Mac next week on August 20. System requirements include Apple silicon Macs with an M2 chip (2022 models) or newer, and at least 16GB of unified memory.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qejn9krPJVM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qejn9krPJVM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Inzoi is available on PC via Steam Early Access and hits PS5 sometime in the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out Inzoi on PS5 next year?
