            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has rolled out its Fall roadmap for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows/dont-stop-me-naoe-because-im-having-a-good-time">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, and perhaps the biggest new is confirmation of its rumored Switch 2 port. Naoe and Yasuke’s adventure hits the Nintendo console on December 2.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Switch 2 will include all recent updates and free content drops. The paid story expansion, Claws of Awaji, will become available sometime next year. The game also features touchscreen features in all the menus including the world map, store, and hideout. The Switch 2 version will also function with cross-progression to Ubisoft Connect, allowing purchasers to continue their progress from other platforms.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzyD_EFZzgc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzyD_EFZzgc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As for the rest of the roadmap, Title Update 10, arriving on October 28, adds a second parkour update and a new Animus-themed activity called Corrupted Castles, which adds a higher difficulty, new enemies, and greater rewards to completed castles.</p><p>On November 25, a third story drop arrives called A Puzzlement, which Ubisoft describes as having a much sillier tone a la Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. It introduces a new environmental puzzle, and both protagonists will learn new skills from each other. Naoe can use Yasuke’s war kick move, while Yasuke can perform non-lethal stealth takedowns.&nbsp;You can learn more details about the Fall roadmap in the developer update video below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qf2bP-Ri5mk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qf2bP-Ri5mk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/23/assassins-creed-shadows-sneaks-to-switch-2-in-december]]></content:encoded>
