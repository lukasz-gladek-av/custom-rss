            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo aired a special Direct for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>today and released a brand-new trailer for the upcoming film, set to hit theaters in April. In the trailer, we get new looks at returning characters like Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, and Toad, alongside our first look at Rosalina and Bowser Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Direct, Nintendo and Illumination, which is creating the movie, revealed that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-casts-brie-larson-as-rosalina-benny-safdie">Brie Larson will voice Rosalina and Benny Safdie will voice Bowser Jr</a>. In the trailer, we get to see and hear both of these new (to the movie franchise) characters in action. As <em>the </em>galactic protector, Rosalina is quite adept at tackling any challenge before her with her special wand and star friends known as the Lumas – we get to see her use that wand against a strange mechanical enemy and read a special book to her Lumas. As for Safdie's Bowser Jr., we see the character's more traditional look alongside a seemingly powered-up (perhaps mechanical) version of Bowser's child.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the new trailer for </strong><em><strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </strong></em><strong>below:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, alongside looks at returning and new characters, this trailer also shows us glimpses of the planet-hopping adventure the Mario Bros. crew will go on in the movie, highlighting that even Peach and Toad will do some galactic travel. Eagle-eyed watchers might even notice a familiar planet or two in the quick scenes, too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some additional screenshots from the trailer:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>hits theaters on April 3, 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-casts-brie-larson-as-rosalina-benny-safdie">the movie's latest casting news</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hits-theaters-in-april">check out the reveal trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a><em>. </em>After that, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2023/04/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-1-upping-the-rest"><em>Game Informer's </em>review of <em>The Super Mario Bros.

Movie</em></a> in 2023, Illumination is creating this movie with Nintendo, and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri joined Super Mario Bros. creator Shigeru Miyamoto during the Direct to make this casting announcement. However, after revealing Larson as the voice of Rosalina, Bowser voice actor Jack Black crashed the Direct to take over and announce Safdie's involvement himself. In case you're unfamiliar, here's a look at Larson and Safdie and the characters they're voicing:&nbsp;</p><p>During the Direct, Nintendo not only released a brand new <a href="https://youtu.be/GuCejewteF8?si=EiojIk9vsdK1pPT-">trailer</a> for the film, but it also released two quick scenes showcasing Larson as Rosalina and Safdie as Bowser Jr. You can check out both in the final minutes of the Direct below:&nbsp;</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/live/yqjMaKQskW8?si=n_VLA7i2XgdsmIv4" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, both Larson and Safdie sound great in their roles, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too long to hear more, as <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>hits theaters on April 3.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hits-theaters-in-april">check out the reveal trailer for <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/movie-review/2023/04/04/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-1-upping-the-rest"><em>Game Informer's </em>review of <em>The Super Mario Bros.
