            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Peter Molyneux, the mind behind the Fable series, Populous, and Black &amp; White, announced his next game, Masters of Albion, during <a href="https://youtu.be/CSLGKKAuZwo?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB">Gamescom 2024</a>. His next – and final – game is coming to PC on April 22.</p><p>Masters of Albion comes from Molyneux’s studio, 22 Cans, and blends elements of real-time strategy, town management, and simulation to an experience Molyneux describes as “the culmination of my life’s work,” in a press release. Players take on the role of a powerful god possessing a “god hand” capable of designing and building entire villages from the ground-up.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joy9aDGawTU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joy9aDGawTU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Buildings can be customized, and different types of structures can be combined to form new building types. As you lord over your human citizens, you can manipulate them via possession, inspire them with divine acts, or punish them using abilities such as weather manipulation and more. Masters of Albion does not feature timers or waiting, allowing players to rule their worlds at their own pace. You can explore Albion from the heavens, control humans or animals such as dogs and chickens to take in the sights on foot. Players can complete quests to unlock treasures and secrets, or explore hidden areas to uncover the secret history of Albion.</p><p>When night falls, the gameplay of Masters of Albion shifts into more of an RTS as players defend villages against evil creatures that appear in the dark. Fighting back involves building and placing defensive weapons, such as turrets, constructing walls and other structures to funnel enemies where needed, and hiring heroes to protect the populace. You can also possess heroes to fight monsters directly in real-time combat.</p><p>Masters of Albion is 22 Cans’ first game since launching The Trail: Frontier Challenge in 2017. In October 2025, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/">Molyneux told <em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a> that the game serves as a form of “redemption” following 22 Cans’ previous projects in which he overpromised and underdelivered, such as 2012's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/05/26/22-cans-announces-goddess-curiosity-cube-winner-will-control-the-game.aspx">Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube</a> and 2014’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/godus/b/ios/archive/2014/08/07/godus-launches-today-on-ios.aspx">Godus</a>. He also stated that Masters of Albion would be the final game of his 43-year career.</p><p>“I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about Curiosity,” Molyneux told <em>VGC</em> last October. “But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. And so, Masters of Albion is a redemption title for me. But also, it’s my last game. It just is.”</p><p>It makes sense, then, why Molyneux bills Masters of Albion as the nexus of every game he’s worked on, from Dungeon Keeper to Fable. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map,” says Molyneux in today’s announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Masters of Albion will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/12/peter-molyneuxs-final-game-masters-of-albion-gets-april-release-date]]></content:encoded>
