            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ninja Gaiden 4, the long-awaited fourth mainline entry in the iconic action franchise, graces the next cover of <em>Game Informer</em>, and we could not be more excited to feature both the new protagonist, Yakumo, and his counterpart, the series' longtime hero, Ryu Hayabusa, on the full spread of our cover art. The digital issue goes live today at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/ninjagaiden4">GameInformer.com/NinjaGaiden4</a>, with print subscriptions rolling out in a few weeks. If you haven't subscribed yet, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">there's still time to get the Ninja Gaiden 4 issue shipped to your mailbox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ninja Gaiden franchise has been dormant for more than a decade, but 2025 has been a big comeback year for the series. Koei Tecmo kicked off the year with an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the beloved Ninja Gaiden 2, followed by Dotemu and The Game Kitchen's incredible retro-facing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ninja-gaiden-ragebound/a-retro-revelation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0fc156cb-d76d-423a-8fd8-c650e1b0aef4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. However, the franchise's 2025 is far from over, as the first mainline entry in more than 13 years is set to hit this October. Just like Ninja Gaiden 4 delivers action starring two ninjas, it also unites two fabled game studios: series developer Team Ninja and the acclaimed action team at PlatinumGames.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We flew to Tokyo, Japan, to spend a day in PlatinumGames' headquarters, talking to various members of the team from both studios and playing through the first several chapters of the story. Our cover story explores how Team Ninja united with the studio behind such beloved titles as Nier: Automata, Astral Chain, and the Bayonetta series, plus a deep dive into what to expect when the game launches in October.</p><p>The Ninja Gaiden 4 cover story is the centerpiece, but our next issue is so much more than that article. If you're new to Ninja Gaiden, our editor-in-chief Matt Miller <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/legacy-of-the-ninja">runs down the history and importance of the franchise</a>. Wesley LeBlanc spent a week in Beijing and Shanghai, China, to go in-depth with the promising action title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/kung-fu-punk">Phantom Blade Zero</a>. Marcus Stewart caught up with the indie masters at Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games to dig into what makes <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/digging-for-gems">Mina the Hollower</a> such an exciting prospect. Charles Harte spoke with the team behind <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/suiting-back-up">Dispatch</a> about rising from the ruins of Telltale Games to create a humorous superhero game. We also have a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/a-conversation-with-matt-mercer">conversation with prolific voice actor and <em>Critical Role</em> dungeon master extraordinaire Matt Mercer</a>, as well as a piece from award-winning comedy writer Mike Drucker about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/roberta-quest">the legacy of King's Quest and its creator Roberta Williams</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The announcement of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/hollow-knight-silksong-launches-on-september-4">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release date</a> has created a ripple effect in the indie game community. With the game launching on such short notice – next week, on September 4 – several indie titles that were slated to release on or near that date are collectively jumping out of its blast radius to avoid being overshadowed. Devolver Digital’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2023/09/14/baby-steps-launches-on-ps5-and-pc-next-summer">Baby Steps</a> joins this list.</p><p>The upcoming physics-based walking adventure by the creators of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy was set to launch on September. 8. Although it wouldn’t have arrived until one week after Silksong, publisher Devolver Digital isn’t taking chances and has delayed Baby Steps to September 23. The game, first announced in 2023, follows an "unemployed loser" named Nate who takes his literal first steps into a fantastical world. Players must master the physics-based walking to awkwardly/humorously traverse environments.</p><p>“Nate, the wary, onesie-donned failson at the heart of the eccentric adventure in literal walking simulator Baby Steps, has stumbled after attempting to ascend his greatest challenge yet: launching the week after Hollow Knight: Silksong's surprise release date,” reads Devolver’s press release.</p><p>A cute trailer announcing the new release date shows Nate awkwardly climbing atop a giant model of Hornet, the protagonist of Silksong. When Baby Steps launches, it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Baby Steps isn't alone. Yesterday, publisher Ysbryd Games <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/25/demonschool-delayed-to-avoid-releasing-near-hollow-knight-silksong">delayed its tactical RPG Demonschool</a> from September 3 to November 19. The Early Access cozy sim title <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594940/Little_Witch_in_the_Woods/">Little Witch in the Woods</a>, which pushed its long-awaited 1.0 launch from September 4 to September 15.</p><p>Indie Metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucas</a> was also planned to release this month, and is now delayed all the way <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579/photo/1">into next year</a>. Retro RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280080/Faeland/">Faeland</a> was set to launch out of Early Access on September 9, but this has been postponed to a yet-to-be-determined date. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a>, a roguelite slot machine game, had its launch moved to September 26 from its original September 3 date. All of these delay announcements specifically cite Hollow Knight: Silksong as the primary culprit.&nbsp;</p><p>This phenomenon will likely continue, as there are still plenty of smaller titles launching well within Silksong's blast radius. Titles like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2865670/JETRUNNER/">Jetrunner</a>, Atari's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1292460/Adventure_of_Samsara/">Adventure of Samsara</a>, Deep Silver's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/">Metal Eden</a>, and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3135840/Hirogami/">Hirogami</a> are just a few titles arriving right alongside Team Cherry's hotly anticipated sequel. It wouldn't surprise me if these developers are having difficult conversations about whether it's wise, or even financially feasible, to delay their titles or to weather the storm and hope for the best.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/26/baby-steps-and-other-indie-games-are-being-delayed-to-avoid-silksongs-launch]]></content:encoded>
