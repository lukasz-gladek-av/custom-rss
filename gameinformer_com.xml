            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Lyrical Games and Ghostrunner series developer One More Level have revealed Valor Mortis, a first-person Soulslike with Metroidvania elements. I’ve played it, and even though it was a pre-alpha demo, it’s already a game I can’t wait for more of.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, Valor Mortis is set during Napoleon’s 19th-century conquest across a war-torn Eastern Europe. Players control a resurrected French soldier corrupted by the power of a mysterious, plague-like substance that runs through their veins. Unfortunately, that substance is key to saving “humanity from the very horrors of war it creates,” according to a press release.&nbsp;</p><h2>Watch 27 Minutes of Valor Mortis Gameplay:&nbsp;</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“With Valor Mortis, we wanted to try something new and original – a darker experience, while still offering players a true challenge,” One More Level CEO Szymon Bryla writes in a press release. “After Ghostrunner, we knew we had the foundation to create a [first-person perspective] title, but this time in a Soulslike genre. At the same time, we wanted to stay true to what we do best –&nbsp;making demanding games for hardcore players, set in an engaging expansive world, while showing that the studio has grown since our previous projects.”&nbsp;</p><p>I played a pre-alpha demo of Valor Mortis and, after roughly an hour with what appears to be its opening level and first boss, I’m thoroughly impressed, even with its current rough edges. It’s clear it’s a pre-alpha dose of the game, as it isn’t the most optimized, but it still runs and looks well enough to understand what One More Level, a 60-person studio based in Poland, is cooking up here.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s One More Level’s description of the game to set the table: “In Valor Mortis, players will embody William, a soldier in the Grande Armée brought back to life from his battlefield grave. William awakens from his death to a plague-ridden Europe, only to find his former allies corrupted into abominations by the Nephtoglobin, an unknown substance that grants him supernatural powers but has taken over his comrades. Navigating this world of scorn, William must master combat and channel his newfound ability in a 19th-century history where war has corrupted the landscape, Napoleon’s Eternal Guard lurks around every corner, and unforgettable boss-fight encounters await players.”&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIF7cL0KRDU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIF7cL0KRDU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Immediately, it’s clear Valor Mortis is a One More Level game – it isn’t Ghostrunner, but it feels right at home in this team’s lineage. It’s much slower, naturally, but dodging and parrying feels similar to Ghostrunner II, and though it’s set in a fantastical take on a wartorn 19th-century Eastern Europe, I can see it’s the same visual team behind One More Level’s cyberpunk series. In fact, game director Radosław Ratusznik tells me in an interview that the visuals of this new IP are heavily influenced by the Soulslike nature of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>He says the Ghostrunner games feature gorgeous visuals by One More Level’s art team, but due to the game's nature, players speed right past its vistas and sights. With Valor Mortis’ slowed-down pace, he’s excited for players to see what these artists can cook up. It’s another reason Valor Mortis is a first-person game, besides the fact that first-person is where One More Level feels most comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>All the typical Soulslike facets are there – challenging enemies to defeat, grueling and monstrous bosses, a stagger bar, parries, blocks, and dodges, lanterns (this game’s bonfires), and a tree of stats to adjust with a currency earned from defeating enemies. But where Valor Mortis really stands out is its first-person perspective. Truthfully, I don’t think I’ve played a first-person Soulslike before, and it’s such a simple but drastic change to the formula that I’m shocked I haven’t played one on novelty alone. It’s more immersive and adds a level of urgency (well, even more urgency) to every fight – I can’t scan what’s around me to ensure safety for a dodge or a place to heal. All I have is what’s right in front of me, and Valor Mortis feels all the more dangerous as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, every action I take feels riskier; if I slash now, the enemy literally right in front of my face can follow up with a counter, and I need to be ready. Sure, the same rules apply in the typical third-person perspective of the genre, but, to use a cliché, it feels more immersive here.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside my cutlass, I have a pistol that I can use to aim-down-sights and shoot weak points on enemies, adding a fun FPS feel to the Soulslike combat. It’s a smart move – first-person perspectives are typically associated with first-person shooters, so why not borrow an element of that?&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Ratusznik warns that bullets are highly limited (they are) and players shouldn’t treat any aspect of Valor Mortis like an FPS. The pistol is best used for targeting weak points, and I found switching from my pistol, after shooting a weak point, to my BioShock-like left hand that spews flames prevented me from relying on my pistol for more than that. Plus, the fire adds a burn status to enemies after I scorch them enough, inflicting constant damage and opening them up for easy finisher attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>The final element of Valor Mortis that stands out to me is its setting. Fighting undead French soldiers and more while the ghost/phantom/voice of Napoleon whispers in my ear, harkening me to inflict damage to all around me in his name, is a unique twist on the fantasy of Soulslike. I’m reminded of Lies of P, which excellently used an odd but ultimately standout setting to tell its story – I look forward to seeing if Valor Mortis can reach similar heights.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s more at play in Valor Mortis, including abilities gained that allow you to traverse to prior levels in Metroidvania fashion, optional bosses, and more, and you can get a taste of that in&nbsp;Game Informer’s&nbsp;hands-on gameplay at the top of this story.&nbsp;</p><p>Valor Mortis is due out sometime in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and I can’t wait.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/hands-on-preview/2025/08/19/valor-mortis-is-a-first-person-soulslike-from-the-ghostrunner-devs-and]]></content:encoded>
