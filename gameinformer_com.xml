There's a demo out today on PC, and it's launching on Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year (here's hoping it makes its way to PlayStation 5 one day, too). This was revealed as part of today's Devolver Direct, which went with a different approach to its summer showcase this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the zanier off-the-wall antics of the annual summer Devolver Direct, which usually contains multiple announcements, it released a documentary called "BALL x PIT: The Kenny Sun Story," alongside a trailer for the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can view the Ball x Pit reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"In Ball x Pit, Ballbylon has fallen," a press release reads. "After a meteoric and completely unexpected event annihilated the great city, all that remains is an ominous, yawning pit. Treasure hunters far and wide flock to the city's tomb to seek their fortune, plundering the depths in search of Ballbylon's scattered riches. Few return.</p><p>"The pit plays host to armies of barbaric creatures, hellbent on ending your quest before it even begins. Armed with a growing arsenal of magic-infused projectiles, batter your way through multiple levels of increasingly challenging obstacles to claim the ultimate prizes and rebuild New Ballbylon. With every glob you lob, gain valuable experience to develop overpowered spitball combinations, and recruit additional heroes to unlock new skills to send the gutter-dwelling goons packing."&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see in the Ball x Pit trailer above, it fuses quite a few different gameplay mechanics to create a roguelite. There's classic brick-breaking action (with Vampire Survivors-like explosions of numbers all over the screen), base-building, and survival gameplay, all morphed into one experience as you attempt run after run. It features over 60 randomized balls to equip, 70 unique buildings for New Ballbylon that provide gameplay bonuses, power-ups, and characters, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>You can try out Ball x Pit on PC via a new Steam demo right now before it launches on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
