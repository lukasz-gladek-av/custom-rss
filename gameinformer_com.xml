While hundreds of thousands of hopeful gamers will likely be refreshing the websites of <a href="https://buff.ly/340n4Ou">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://buff.ly/BCrRzOM">Target</a>, and <a href="https://buff.ly/dfdT51Z">Walmart</a>, hoping to be lucky enough to successfully push an order through and secure their piece of the first Switch 2 wave, Nintendo also <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c942683-aa0d-42df-b11a-12e2b25a91dd" href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2">asked interested players to register their My Nintendo accounts</a> as interested in pre-ordering the upcoming system to enter into a lottery. However, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took to Nintendo's Japanese social media accounts to share some bad news regarding the lottery system.</p>

<p>According to a post shared on Nintendo's Japanese X account, Nintendo received 2.2 million interested players in Japan alone. If that number is truly representative of the number of players who want to purchase a Switch 2 in Japan, it would far exceed the initial Japanese sales numbers of the Switch 1, which, according to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/nintendo-sells-313700-switch-consoles-in-japan-over-launch-weekend/"><em>VentureBeat,</em></a> reached just over 313,000 units in its first weekend. In the console's first month, Nintendo sold 2.74 million units worldwide, meaning that the 2.2 million Japanese registrations nearly reaches that number on its own.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>According to Furukawa, Nintendo cannot fulfill all of those requests at launch. However, if you register through the My Nintendo Store and are not selected to purchase during the first wave, you will have another chance once the company can replenish its supply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can see the full translation of Furukawa's post from X below.</p>

<div>
<p>Hello, this is Furukawa. We have been procuring many materials and proceeding with production in advance so that we can deliver the Nintendo Switch 2 to you. On April 2nd, we announced details about the Nintendo Switch 2 and started accepting applications for the lottery sale on the My Nintendo Store. As a result, we received an extremely large number of applications, approximately 2.2 million people in Japan alone. However, this number far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th. Therefore, unfortunately, we expect that a significant number of customers will not be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow, April 24th.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the trouble of those who were not selected in the first lottery sale having to reapply, My Nintendo Store will automatically carry over those who were not selected in the first lottery sale to the second lottery sale. However, even including the quantity for the second lottery sale, we cannot fulfill all of the applications we received. We deeply apologize for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations.</p>

<p>In response to this demand, we are currently working on further strengthening our production system. In addition, starting tomorrow, April 24th, game retailers and online stores nationwide will begin accepting pre-orders or lottery sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 console (please check the information of each retailer for details). The console will also continue to be sold at the My Nintendo Store after the release date (more details will be announced at a later date). With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands.</p>

<p>We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologize for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding.</p>
</div>

<p>Though Furukawa alludes to it, he doesn't directly say that Nintendo will be unable to fulfill demand through its retail partners. Still, with the company seeing such increased demand in its home country, players worldwide will likely encounter fierce competition and, more than likely, frustration while trying to get their hands on a launch model Switch 2. Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-set-for-october-collectors-edition-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The follow-up to 2020's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima/ghost-of-tsushima-review-a-most-honorable-epic">acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei has garnered a lot of excitement following its announcement during a PlayStation State of Play livestream last September. The open-world adventure places players in the boots of a new samurai named Atsu 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima. However, developer Sucker Punch Productions largely went quiet following the surprise reveal last year. That changed today, as the studio revealed additional details about Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei, including the release date.</p>

<p>Players who have been waiting a half-decade to continue exploring Sucker Punch's stunning recreation of feudal Japan can now circle October 2 on their calendars. The game is available in the standard edition for $70, but if you're excited enough to want some bonuses, Sony is also offering a Digital Deluxe Edition as well as a physical Collector's Edition. The Digital Deluxe Edition costs $80 and includes in-game Snake Armor, exclusive armor dye and horse with saddle, a charm, an early unlock of the Traveller's Map, and a sword kit. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition costs $250 and offers all the Digital Deluxe content (including a digital copy of the game), plus physical items like a sash, a tsuba, art cards, a papercraft ginkgo tree, and a zeni hajiki coin game with pouch.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>The final inclusion of today's Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei announcements is a trailer called "The Onryō's List." The story goes that 16 years prior to the events of the game, a gang called The&nbsp;Yōtei Six killed her family and pinned her to a burning ginkgo tree, leaving her for dead. She somehow survived the ordeal and what appeared to be a death sentence from the gang of outlaws and she harnessed that strength and motivation to learn how to fight, kill, and hunt. In Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei, Atsu returns home with a list of the six names of those in The&nbsp;Yōtei Six, with eyes toward vengeance.</p>

<p>Using the same katana that pinned her to the tree, Atsu embarks on a mission to avenge her family. The story plays out in Ezo, which is known as Hokkaido today. New gameplay mechanics will allow the player to understand Atsu's past to fully come to know how much was truly stolen from her by The&nbsp;Yōtei Six. Sucker Punch claims it has built upon and evolved the way players can explore the massive open world, with more freedom and variety on offer than in Ghost of Tsushima. Atsu can choose which member of The&nbsp;Yōtei Six she wants to pursue first, while also claiming bounties, learning new skills, and exploring the natural beauty of northern Japan.</p>

<p>You can see the new trailer released by Sucker Punch Productions below.</p>

<p>Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei arrives exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If you're hungry for more information surrounding the highly anticipated follow-up, Sucker Punch promises to show more in the approach to that date.</p>
