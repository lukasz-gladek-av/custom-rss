            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dying_light/b/xboxone/archive/2015/02/02/dying-light-game-informer-review.aspx">Dying Light</a>, developer Techland has rolled out a free graphical update to the 2015 title dubbed Dying Light: Retouched. While not billed as a full remaster or a total presentational overhaul, the city of Harran looks better than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>The Retouched update introduces upscaled textures, ultra 8K shadow quality level, and improved physics rendering on water and metallic surfaces. The game’s Level of Detail (LOD) has also been raised, meaning Techland increased the distance that detailed assets are loaded in the game. &nbsp;As Techland notes in its <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">developer blog</a>, Retouched is all about “squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love," although the level of improvements players will experience varies by platform. You can check out some before/after shots in the gallery below.</p><p>The soundtrack, however, has been remastered by original composer Pawel Błaszczak. The audio also features new tracks and ambient sounds along with improved hit reaction audio.</p><p>Today looks to be a good one to revisit Dying Light ahead of the launch of the latest entry, Dying Light: The Beast, which arrives on August 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can catch a recent trailer from Summer Game Fest earlier this month <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/dying-light-the-beast-launches-in-august-and-gets-a-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/26/the-original-dying-light-gets-a-free-graphical-update-today]]></content:encoded>
