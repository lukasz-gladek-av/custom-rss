That's because Tersier has been hard at work creating Reanimal, a new co-op horror game right around the corner. Today, we learned that the game will drop early next year, on February 13. Check out the trailer from today's Xbox Partner Preview below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9sEV58DC7w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9sEV58DC7w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Reanimal follows a brother and sister making their way through Hell to rescue their missing friends. In dimly lit sewers, alleyways, and vaguely industrial spaces dark creatures chase the protagonists from one location to the next. While what we've seen of the co-op gameplay looks fine so far, the real draw for this studio is the dark, twisted atmosphere and art style, and today's trailer has both in spades.</p><p>To check out a glimpse of Reanimal today, you can download the demo on Xbox <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/reanimal/9n67dhnp2m0t">here</a> or on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4019420/REANIMAL_Demo/">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/20/reanimal-the-next-game-from-the-little-nightmares-team-drops-in-february]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>007 First Light is one of our most anticipated games of 2026, and for good reason. After spending years giving us <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hitman-3/hitman-3-review-a-killer-conclusion">extremely fun playgrounds for Agent 47 to engineer kills in</a>, IO Interactive is now bringing that skillset to Agent 007. Today's newest trailer gave us a look at James Bond's car of choice, the Aston Martin Valhalla.&nbsp;</p><p>As expected, 007's Aston Martin Valhalla will be decked out with all kinds of special modifications, including guns, weaponry, and gadgets befitting of a 00 Agent. According to IO Interactive, it will serve as a "much-needed sidekick" to the younger version of James Bond that we're following in 007 First Light.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuioeoGlv7Q" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuioeoGlv7Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>James Bond has an illustrious career in video games, with titles like GoldenEye 007, The World is Not Enough, Everything or Nothing, Nightfire, Bloodstone, From Russia with Love, and Quantum of Solace holding special places in the hearts of many. While many of those games adapt stories from films or feature an existing Bond, 007 First Light tells a completely original story of a younger James Bond on a mission that will earn him his license to kill.</p><p>007 First Light arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/new-007-first-light-trailer-reveals-aston-martin-valhalla-as-bonds]]></content:encoded>

The game takes place in Paris, which has become overrun with demons after the fall of humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>Players control a supernatural warrior hailing from an ancient order who wields traditional firearms and celestial powers, such as a glowing scythe-like weapon. You’ll battle your way through demons in search of a gateway to heaven called the Sunless Gate. A run-based game, death means restarting with different weapon loadouts, and players will gain new abilities the further they progress.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6q28rgDKA3o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6q28rgDKA3o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Armatus is coming in 2026 to Xbox Series X/S and PC.&nbsp;It's also coming to Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/godfall-creators-reveal-dark-fantasy-shooter-roguelite-armatus]]></content:encoded>
