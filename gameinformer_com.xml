            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft is appointing three developers to a new leadership team in charge of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Technically, Vantage Studios is doing the appointing, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">as it's the subsidiary Ubisoft established last year to manage its highest profile franchises</a>, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy each have experience with various stages of the series' nearly 20-year history, but all three worked on 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. Ubisoft announced the news <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">in a post on its website</a>.</p>

<p>Schelling will serve as the Head of Assassin's Creed Brand, which will put him in charge of "overall strategy and long-term vision." He's previously worked as a producer or brand producer at various levels on most games since Revelations, including Black Flag, Origins, and Valhalla. According to LinkedIn, he's worked as Ubisoft's Chief Production Officer since April 2024.</p><p>Guesdon will be the Head of Content, which seems to be the most hands-on out of the three roles. He'll reportedly "lead [the franchise's] creative direction, support individual games, and guide the future of Assassin’s Creed." He was the creative director of both Black Flag and Origins, though he left Ubisoft from 2023 to mid 2024 to work at Behaviour Interactive, a studio best known for Dead by Daylight.</p><p>Finally, de Billy is the new Head of Production Excellence, tasked with broadly strengthening production practices across Vantage's various Assassin's Creed projects. He was a production designer on Origins and Valhalla, but has worked at Ubisoft since 2001, and currently is its Global Senior Production Director.</p><p>We enjoyed Shadows, the most recent entry in the Assassin's Creed series (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows/dont-stop-me-naoe-because-im-having-a-good-time">and you can read our review of it here</a>). We're still waiting to see what exactly Ubisoft has in mind for the popular historical fiction franchise moving forward, but the last entry is less than a year old, so it'll likely be a while. But while we haven't heard about Assassin's Creed, its parent company has been in the news a lot in 2026, and not for good reasons. You can read about how it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shut down its recently unionized Halifax studio</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer">how it laid off employees at Massive Entertainment</a>, or <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-cancels-prince-of-persia-remake-and-5-other-games-as-part-of-major">how it canceled six games in development (including the Sands of Time remake)</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/23/ubisoft-appoints-assassins-creed-leadership-team-made-of-series-veterans]]></content:encoded>
