            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Coming off the reveal of a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-announces-new-divinity-game">new Divinity title</a> at the Game Awards last week, Larian Studios has announced that its 2017 RPG Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Before Larian Studios catapulted to superstardom with Baldur’s Gate 3, it released the arguably equally beloved Divinity: Original Sin 2 in September 2017. The RPG centers on a band of heroes, hailing from five playable races, to save the world of Rivellon from evil. The game can be played alone or alongside up to three other players in co-op.</p><p>Now, Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition, a 2018 enhanced version featuring an expanded storyline and improved gameplay, has arrived to current gen platforms for $49.99. &nbsp;The game is a free upgrade for existing owners of the last-gen releases across PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><p>Additionally, the last-gen versions of the game are currently on sale at a significant discount for a limited time. On PlayStation, you can pick it up for $14.99 instead of its usual $59.99. On Switch, the game is on sale for $24.99. Xbox owners can pick it up for $17.49.</p><p>We scored Divinity: Original Sin 2 a 9.75 out of 10. In his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2/a-godly-ascension">review</a>, former <em>Game Informer</em> editor Daniel Tack wrote, “Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the greatest PC RPGs of all time, and Larian’s continued dedication to creating incredible freeform adventures inspired by tabletop lineage is inspiring and commendable.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-surprise-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2-today]]></content:encoded>
