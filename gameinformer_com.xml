Lady Loki, a female version of the god of mischief, is coming to the in-game shop later this week, complete with a new voice lines from a (presumably) new voice actor. You can see the skin in action below.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🐍 Lurking and ready to strike!</p><p>"The fates do have their little surprises, do they not?

While the TV series' Sylvie is a popular take on the character in her own right, Lady Loki is typically depicted as a woman with long black hair, like we see in NetEase's shooter.</p>

      <p>Lady Loki in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>While past cosmetics have put filters on voice lines or included alternate sound/visual effects, this is the most transformative skin Marvel Rivals has seen to date, and raises the question of other potential character variants that could be included as cosmetic overhauls. That said, as far as I know, no one else on the roster has an alternate version as popular as Lady Loki that would require re-recorded voice lines. And I'd prefer characters who have taken up existing heroes' mantles (like Miles Morales, Shuri, or Kate Bishop) to get their own spot on the roster, rather than a reskin.&nbsp;</p><p>Future speculation aside, Lady Loki is real, but will only be available from January 2 to January 30, so if you're interested, make sure to pick her up while you can.
