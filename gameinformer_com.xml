Movie</a>, is getting a dedicated Nintendo Direct later this week. According to the Nintendo Today app and <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">social media posts</a>, the livestream will air at 9 AM ET/ 6 AM PT.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer," the social media post reads. "Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation."</p><p>While it's not surprising, eager fans can rule out the possibility of news of a new Mario game during this stream. If it's anything like the Direct for the last Mario movie, it will likely include some statements from people at Nintendo and Illumination, add in a potential casting reveal, and conclude with a teaser from the film. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPCXuvL8EM">You can check out the last direct as a reference here</a>.</p><p>While we don't know much about the Super Mario Galaxy movie, we know a few things. Much of the main cast is confirmed to return, but while Rosalina is a crucial part of the Mario Galaxy games, we don't know for certain whether she'll appear. On the other hand, Yoshi, one of the most recognizable faces in the Mario universe, will very likely make an appearance. This floating green dinosaur was teased at the end of the first movie when a Yoshi egg was revealed to be sitting in the sewers. We also know Yoshi appears in the movie because, of all things, it was revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">via a box of Mario-themed cookie dough</a>.</p><p>When the Direct does go live on Wednesday, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yqjMaKQskW8">watch on YouTube</a> or on the Nintendo Today app.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/10/a-nintendo-direct-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-blasts-off-november-12]]></content:encoded>
