            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last November, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/11/12/everything-we-learned-in-nintendos-direct-for-the-super-mario-galaxy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6151d643-41cb-4b79-a1df-e0070f202633" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Nintendo hosted a Direct for <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a>, sharing a new trailer and behind-the-scenes details about the sequel to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/05/01/the-super-mario-bros-movie-leaps-past-1-billion-at-the-box-office" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7c354729-f095-43f3-944d-6088d78a6fd6" data-entity-substitution="canonical">2023's box office hit</a>. Even though the movie is only a few more months away, today <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/movies/super-mario-galaxy/">the company announced a second livestream</a>, which will presumably provide even more detail than the last. The stream will also air during the weekend, which is abnormal for Nintendo, on January 25 at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET. When it's live, you can watch it on Nintendo's YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_2YywtBYAaw">right here</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the messaging around this Direct has been clear that it's strictly limited to information about the movie. If Mario fans were hoping for some kind of video game announcement or tie-in, they'll be disappointed; a description for the event on Nintendo's website includes the line "Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuCejewteF8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The last look at <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> showed us some of the movie's major new characters, including fan-favorite Rosalina (played by Brie Larson) and Bowser Jr. (played by Benny Safdie). It also included updates from executive producer Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, like the fact that the studio was weeks away from putting the finishing touches on the movie.
