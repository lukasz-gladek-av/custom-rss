            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-removing-over-20-games-including-hades-and-monument-valley-123023128.html"><em>Engadget</em></a>, Netflix is removing over 20 games from its mobile library next month. The list of titles on the chopping block includes heavy hitters like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hades/hades-review-the-highs-and-lows-of-repetition">Hades</a>, the Monument Valley series, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/deaths-door/deaths-door-review-reaping-the-rewards">Death’s Door</a>.</p><p>On July 15, 22 titles, which require a Netflix subscription to play, will exit the service. Some games, such as Hades, were only available on mobile devices through Netflix, so it’s unclear if they’ll become available on other mobile storefronts. Although July 15 is the removal date, some titles will disappear before then (such as Hades, exiting on July 1). Here’s the full list of games making their exit:</p><ul><li>Battleship</li><li>Braid, Anniversary Edition</li><li>Carmen Sandiego</li><li>CoComelon: Play with JJ</li><li>Death’s Door</li><li>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</li><li>Dumb Ways to Die</li><li>Ghost Detective</li><li>Hades (available only on iOS)</li><li>Katana Zero</li><li>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</li><li>Ludo King</li><li>Monument Valley</li><li>Monument Valley 2</li><li>Monument Valley 3</li><li>Rainbow Six: SMOL</li><li>Raji: An Ancient Epic</li><li>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</li><li>TED Tumblewords</li><li>The Case of the Golden Idol</li><li>The Rise of the Golden Idol</li><li>Vineyard Valley</li></ul><p>Netflix’s entire mobile library consists of 114 games, which means roughly 20 percent of its library is disappearing. While this isn't the first time games have been delisted from the mobile library, these removals come as some question Netflix Games' long-term future.</p><p>Last October, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-has-closed-its-aaa-gaming-studio-133014946.html">shut down its triple-A game development studio</a> in Southern California, leading to the departures of several high-profile talents only a few months after the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-games-engagement-tripled-in-the-last-year-in-part-thanks-to-gta">expressed optimism</a> about its games division. In January, the company <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/">canceled plans </a>to bring previously announced titles to the service, including Thirsty Suitors, Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, and Don't Starve Together. In February, &nbsp;Netflix <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">laid off staff</a> at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, which it acquired in 2021. The streaming giant has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663933/netflix-black-mirror-bandersnatch-kimmy-schmidt-removal">scaled back on interactive programming</a>, removing shows such as <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em>. &nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/25/netflix-is-delisting-over-20-games-from-its-mobile-library-next-month-including-hades]]></content:encoded>
