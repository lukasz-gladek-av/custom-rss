            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Despite launching on September 12 to a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/borderlands-4/cathartic-chaos">generally positive critical reception</a>, Borderlands 4 has been plagued with performance issues on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. While the studio continues to iron out the kinks, it has decided to delay the Switch 2 launch of Borderlands 4 to an unspecified date.</p><p>Since its launch on other platforms, players have reported technical issues with Borderlands 4, including unstable framerates, stuttering, and crashes, even on higher-end PCs. As a result of the latter, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam reviews</a> currently stand at "Mixed."</p><p>Borderlands 4 was scheduled to launch on Switch 2 on October 3, but Gearbox has pushed the date to ensure this version doesn't suffer a similar fate. As a result, Gearbox is canceling all digital pre-orders on the Nintendo eShop (though players can do this themselves or wait for it to occur automatically on Friday, September 26). The studio also states it plans to time the eventual release of this version to coincide with the arrival of cross-saves, a feature currently in development.</p><p>Here is Gearbox’s full message, as shared on <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">X</a>:</p><p>Greetings, Vault Hunters.</p><p>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross-saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.</p><p>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, September 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact [Nintendo]. For physical pre-orders, please reach out to the corresponding retailer.</p><p>We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.</p><p>For more on Borderlands 4, you can watch our recent interview with the developers on this episode of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/video-podcast/2025/09/12/silksong-act-1-hell-is-us-review-borderlands-4-interview"><em>The Game Informer Show</em></a> podcast. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/borderlands-4/cathartic-chaos">You can read Game Informer's Borderlands 4 review by following the link</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/24/borderlands-4-on-switch-2-delayed-amid-ongoing-performance-issues]]></content:encoded>
