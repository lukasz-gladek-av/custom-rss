            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has revealed the launch date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows' first story expansion. It also detailed other significant updates coming as part of the summer stretch of its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-year-1-roadmap-includes-story-expansion-parkour-improvements-new">Year 1 content roadmap</a>.</p><p>Claws of the Awaji, the game’s first big story DLC, is launching on September 16. Set after the conclusion of Shadow’s events (meaning you need to beat the game to unlock it), it centers on Naoe tackling a fresh slate of foes on the new island setting of Awaji. The expansion is touted to feature over 10 hours of content and will be free to players who pre-ordered Shadows. It is unclear how much Claws of Awaji will cost to purchase standalone.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New Game Plus arrives in an update next week on July 29. The mode resets story and objective board progression, but allows players to retain their character level, gear, skill points, knowledge rank, and Hideout progression in a fresh campaign. When starting New Game Plus, players have the option of restarting the story from the very beginning or skipping the prologue and starting when Naoe first acquires the Hideout.</p><p>In terms of progression, the July update also raises the level cap from 60 to 80. New Knowledge Ranks, Mastery, and Knowledge Skill ranks will also be introduced. The Hideout will receive new upgrades, including those for Heiji’s Forge. July 29 will also add Project 3, adding new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.</p>
