            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is the gaming industry's most anticipated game, but after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">last Friday's news that it would be delayed into May of next year</a>, it seemed like it would be a while before we saw any new details about the game. Today, Rockstar decided to surprise the internet once more, but with good news this time: a second trailer. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>This trailer spends a bit more time introducing the audience to Jason Duval, the game's male protagonist, by giving us a glimpse into his day to day life. It seems to be as much about showing off the new and improved Vice City, as Jason lifts weights on the beach, cruises down the highway, and avoids police at night. Eventually, he picks up Lucia Caminos, the other protagonist, from prison, and the game wastes no time showing how head over heels they are for each other. It's almost an even split between action shots and intimate romance, further suggesting that GTA VI's story will have a Bonnie and Clyde vibe.</p>

<p>Additionally, developer Rockstar has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">updated its website</a> to include more information and images, including screenshots, new characters, and more. Here's the new synopsis of the game's plot, revealing more of the story's stakes:</p>

<p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida â€” forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is over a year away, giving ravenous fans plenty of time to dissect this new look at the game and mine it for more information. Regardless, we can't wait for May 26 of next year.
