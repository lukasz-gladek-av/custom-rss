            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The PlayStation Plus Essential tier gives subscribers free games every month, and recently, those games have been particularly excellent. Last month's offerings included Lies of P, one of the best games of 2023, but the upcoming September lineup <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">announced on the PS Blog</a> manages to top even that; you'll get Psychonauts 2, Viewfinder, and Stardew Valley, one of the most beloved indie games of all time.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley got a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/19/stardew-valley-16-patch-drops-today-heres-what-to-expect">substantial 1.6 update last year</a>, so if you haven't played it in a while, you'll be greeted by some new features, including new dialogue, new crafting recipes, hats for pets, and, for some reason, the ability to drink mayonnaise. I don't know who's out there saying, "I'd love to play Stardew Valley, but it's a deal breaker that you can't drink mayo straight from the jar," but if that's you, you're in luck.</p><p>The other two games are nothing to sneeze at either. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/psychonauts-2/psychonauts-2-review-well-worth-the-wait">Psychonauts 2 scored a nine from us</a> when it released back in 2021 and even made its way onto <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2021">our top ten list from that year</a>. It's the long awaited sequel to Double Fine's platformer from 2005, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/07/05/the-history-of-double-fine-productions">we did a retrospective on the studio's history</a> back when it was featured on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/336-psychonauts-2">the cover of Game Informer issue 336</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/viewfinder/short-and-smart">Viewfinder is a delightful puzzle game</a> from 2023 that reminds me of Portal in the best way – its photographic puzzle solving is incredibly creative game design.</p><p>All three games will be available for subscribers on September 2. You can still download August's games (Lies of P, My Hero One's Justice 2, and DayZ) until then.</p><hr><p><em>Will you be checking these games out on September 2?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">Judas was formally revealed during The Game Awards 2022</a> as the next game from BioShock creator Ken Levine and his studio, Ghost Story Games. Since then, the team has remained mostly silent, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">save for a gameplay trailer last year,</a> on what it's been up to with this sci-fi shooter (that looks a lot like BioShock). However, Levine took to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">PlayStation Blog</a> to share new details about the game's Big 3, villainy system, and the Judas key art.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking inspiration from famed Star Wars poster illustrator Drew Struzan, the Judas key art features the protagonist up front and center, seemingly overshadowing what I think is a variant of her (presumably alluding to the way choices can affect the narrative of the game, though it could just be a totally different character), above the Big 3: Queen Nefertiti, Sheriff Tom Austin, and Hope Jimenez. Levine teases there's more to glean from this key art, so I'll leave you to it:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside this key art, Levine has shared that Ghost Story Games has just finished a major milestone it calls "Villainy." The director writes that villainy is a central feature of Judas, and that your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends, or turn them into foes. "When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain," Levine writes in the blog. "Fontaine, Comstock – they're always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the <em>villain</em>. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."&nbsp;</p><p>The included clip in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">blog post</a> shows a Rent-a-Deputy robotic horse, which can attack enemies for you once rented, turning against you at the hands of Big 3 member, Sheriff Tom Austin. Levine says this is just a small way a Big 3 friend-turned-foe can make your life on the Mayflower, the spaceship setting of Judas, harder.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In the blog, Levine continues, explaining Ghost Story Games wants players to get to know the Big 3 intimately, and wants losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. The Big 3 will be competing for your favor and attention through Judas – they can bribe you, save you in battle, badmouth the other two Big 3 members, and share with you their deepest secrets. But, as Levine points out, eventually, you have to decide who you trust and who you don't... and that's going to cause problems.&nbsp;</p><p>"In BioShock Infinite, there was a lot of energy invested into developing your relationship with Elizabeth," Levine writes. "By the end of the game, you knew everything about her, her abilities, her hopes, and dreams. But the truth is she knew almost nothing about you, the gamer playing Booker. In Judas, the Big 3 observe you as you play, and they have feelings not only about how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting, but most importantly, your interactions with the other two characters."&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, today's blog doesn't include a release date or window for Judas as Ghost Story Games doesn't want to say when its game will launch until it's confident in a date it can hold. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/new-report-details-bioshock-creators-new-game-and-the-rocky-development-employee-burnout">Considering Levine's release track record</a>, Judas could still be years away (but hopefully it isn't).&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">watch the Judas reveal trailer</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">check out the Judas gameplay trailer shown last year</a>. After that, read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/what-we-want-from-bioshock-4">what we want from BioShock 4</a>, which isn't being developed by Ken Levine but is in the works at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2019/12/09/2k-announces-new-studio-for-the-next-bioshock">newcomer studio Cloud Chamber</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Judas' Big 3 villainy system?
