Due out soon on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690030/The_Last_Gas_Station/">Steam</a>, The Last Gas Station falls somewhere between cozy and spooky; service other woodland creatures still driving a gas vehicle during the day, but mysterious things happen to anyone who runs a pump at night.</p><p>As the new owner of this abandoned gas station, you’re tasked with stocking shelves, managing customers' fuel levels, serving snacks, and upgrading your operations to keep things running smoothly. It’s also up to you to solve the mystery behind the previous owner’s disappearance.</p><p><strong>Check out the screenshots for a look at the game below:</strong></p><p>“[Always] keep an eye on the shadows,” a press release reads. “This place has secrets, and not all of them want to stay buried.”</p><p>Alongside running the gas station, players can design custom neon signs, decorate the inside of the store, and ultimately, bring this cozy, tucked-away gas station back to life. While managing the gas station is the main objective of The Last Gas Station, Alawar also describes the game as a “bite-sized, story-driven sim where cozy vibes meet mysterious undertones.”</p><p>“It’s a game about forgotten places, creeping dread, and the effort it takes to keep something – anything – going in a world that’s already moved on,” the press release says.</p><p>There is no release date for The Last Gas Station, but Alawar says it’s coming to PC soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
