            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's November 7, N7 Day, a day BioWare and its community of fans celebrate the developer's sci-fi RPG series, Mass Effect. Sometimes, we get <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/new-mass-effect-5-trailer-teases-original-trilogy-andromeda-and-maybe-a-new">big updates</a>; other times, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/11/07/update-bioware-teases-next-mass-effect-with-clue-filled-video-clip-for-n7-day-hidden">small teases</a> of things to come. This year, BioWare is using N7 day to announce that Amazon's Mass Effect TV adaptation will be a "brand-new story" set after the events of the original Mass Effect trilogy, meaning Commander Shepard likely won't be involved.&nbsp;</p><p>BioWare also gave a minor update on its in-development untitled Mass Effect game, which amounts to: still working on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," series executive producer Mike Gamble writes in the <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">N7 Day blog post</a>. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."&nbsp;</p><p>On the Amazon adaptation side of Mass Effect, Gamble writes that "the show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story – because after all... that's YOUR story, isn't it?"</p><p>Though Gamble says today's N7 Day blog post doesn't feature any hidden meaning or messages, there are various letters in the text in italics, suggesting he might be telling a little white lie. We're sure the Mass Effect community will have it figured out in no time.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/new-mass-effect-5-trailer-teases-original-trilogy-andromeda-and-maybe-a-new">check out this trailer for the in-development Mass Effect game</a> that teases a new trilogy, Andromeda, and maybe a new protagonist.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you happy that the Mass Effect TV show will be an original story?
