            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/06/02/chucklefish-reveals-first-look-at-witchbrook-in-more-than-2-years-steam-page-now-live">Witchbrook</a>, the role-playing life sim game set in a living, breathing wizarding world, has been delayed to 2026. The game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/09/01/stardew-valley-publisher-teases-upcoming-39-stardew-valley-meets-harry-potter-39-game.aspx">first teased way back in 2017</a>, was slated to release this winter.</p><p>Witchbrook has been described as a mix of Stardew Valley and Harry Potter, placing players in the shoes of an aspiring witch/wizard who is a new resident in the magical city of Mossport, where they attend Witchbrook College. Here, players can form friendships, engage in romantic relationships, and interact with citizens who have fully fleshed-out daily schedules and lives. As a student at Witchbrook, you’ll attend classes, complete assignments, and sharpen your spellcasting and potion-making skills to become top of your class.</p><p>Outside of classes, you can freely explore Mossport to engage in activities such as starting a business, renovating your home, and more leisurely excursions. As the school year progresses, Mossport and its residents change throughout the seasons. Witchbrook can also be played with others in four-player online co-op.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Witchbrook is an ambitious game, and developer Chucklefish <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">posted a developer update</a> stating that, despite making good progress en route to launching this year, the team realized it needs more time to ensure Witchbrook lives up to its years-long hype.</p><p>“Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive,” reads Chucklefish’s statement.</p><p>The developer update also revealed the game’s world map. Chucklefish also says a silver lining of the delay is that it allows them to explore the possibility of bringing Witchbrook to more platforms. The game is currently slated to launch on Xbox, PC, and was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday">recently confirmed for Switch</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">Switch 2</a>. The team is also looking to add additional language support and promises more developer updates in the future, including a blog post focused on character customization.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/wizarding-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>
