The game spent over a year in closed beta testing periods, but the team determined it would be difficult to keep it “satisfactory” for players over a long period of time.</p><p>Alongside this announcement, Square Enix assures series fans it is “hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV.” As the title “Missing-Link” implies, this mobile spin-off was meant to provide story content to connect the events of Kingdom Hearts III to the upcoming title. It’s unclear at this point if the cancellation of Missing-Link will affect the development of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/kingdom-hearts-iv">Kingdom Hearts IV</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxOGWd6LoyY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxOGWd6LoyY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Here's Square Enix's statement about the game, in full:&nbsp;</p><p>“We have made the decision to cancel the development of Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.</p><p>We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service. Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.</p><p>We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to everyone who gave us their support and assistance with the multiple closed beta tests. We are truly sorry to have to make this announcement. The Kingdom Hearts series will continue. We are hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, and hope you’ll continue to support the series as you keep an eye out for further updates."</p><p>Missing-Link was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/new-kingdom-hearts-mobile-game-missing-link-announced-closed-beta-test-this-year">announced in 2022</a> and originally <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/30/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-teaser-trailer-confirms-2024-mobile-release">set to launch on mobile devices in 2024</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2022/06/14/nomura-reveals-more-on-kingdom-hearts-iv-and-the-series-future-with"><em>Game Informer’s </em>exclusive interview with Tetsuya Nomura</a> about Kingdom Hearts IV, and then check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/hikaru-utada-has-released-a-new-recording-of-kingdom-hearts-best-song">Hikaru Utada’s new recording of the best song in the Kingdom Hearts series</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Did you get to play Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link?
