Since then, the team has remained mostly silent, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">save for a gameplay trailer last year,</a> on what it's been up to with this sci-fi shooter (that looks a lot like BioShock). However, Levine took to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">PlayStation Blog</a> to share new details about the game's Big 3, villainy system, and the Judas key art.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking inspiration from famed Star Wars poster illustrator Drew Struzan, the Judas key art features the protagonist up front and center, seemingly overshadowing what I think is a variant of her (presumably alluding to the way choices can affect the narrative of the game, though it could just be a totally different character), above the Big 3: Queen Nefertiti, Sheriff Tom Austin, and Hope Jimenez. Levine teases there's more to glean from this key art, so I'll leave you to it:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside this key art, Levine has shared that Ghost Story Games has just finished a major milestone it calls "Villainy." The director writes that villainy is a central feature of Judas, and that your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends, or turn them into foes. "When you play BioShock or BioShock Infinite, the villain is always going to be the villain," Levine writes in the blog. "Fontaine, Comstock – they're always going to be the bad guys. In Judas, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the <em>villain</em>. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."&nbsp;</p><p>The included clip in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">blog post</a> shows a Rent-a-Deputy robotic horse, which can attack enemies for you once rented, turning against you at the hands of Big 3 member, Sheriff Tom Austin. Levine says this is just a small way a Big 3 friend-turned-foe can make your life on the Mayflower, the spaceship setting of Judas, harder.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5_r-un--bA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In the blog, Levine continues, explaining Ghost Story Games wants players to get to know the Big 3 intimately, and wants losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. The Big 3 will be competing for your favor and attention through Judas – they can bribe you, save you in battle, badmouth the other two Big 3 members, and share with you their deepest secrets. But, as Levine points out, eventually, you have to decide who you trust and who you don't... and that's going to cause problems.&nbsp;</p><p>"In BioShock Infinite, there was a lot of energy invested into developing your relationship with Elizabeth," Levine writes. "By the end of the game, you knew everything about her, her abilities, her hopes, and dreams. But the truth is she knew almost nothing about you, the gamer playing Booker. In Judas, the Big 3 observe you as you play, and they have feelings not only about how you approach combat, hacking, and crafting, but most importantly, your interactions with the other two characters."&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, today's blog doesn't include a release date or window for Judas as Ghost Story Games doesn't want to say when its game will launch until it's confident in a date it can hold. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/new-report-details-bioshock-creators-new-game-and-the-rocky-development-employee-burnout">Considering Levine's release track record</a>, Judas could still be years away (but hopefully it isn't).&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2022/2022/12/08/bioshock-creators-ghost-story-games-reveals-first-title-judas">watch the Judas reveal trailer</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/new-look-at-judas-gameplay-reveals-more-bioshock-inspiration">check out the Judas gameplay trailer shown last year</a>. After that, read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/what-we-want-from-bioshock-4">what we want from BioShock 4</a>, which isn't being developed by Ken Levine but is in the works at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2019/12/09/2k-announces-new-studio-for-the-next-bioshock">newcomer studio Cloud Chamber</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Judas' Big 3 villainy system?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Earlier this Summer, Dark Horse Comics and Hasbro's Wizards of the Coast revealed "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks", an all-new Forgotten Realms D&amp;D adventure comic series written by Greg Pak, penciled by Wilton Santos, inked by Advan Alves, colored by Raul Angulo, and lettered by Nate Piekos. This four-issue miniseries begins when Issue #1 arrives this October, but ahead of its release, <em>Game Informer </em>can exclusively reveal a look at a special new art piece and never-before-seen character sketches.&nbsp;</p><p>The four issues will feature art by Marguerite Sauvage, Uzuri, Stephen Segovia, and Dan Panosian, but all four issues will include back cover art by Julie Dillon which, when collected, connect in an homage to J.C. Leyendecker. For the first time ever, you can get a look at what those four back cover art pieces look like when connected here at <em>Game Informer</em> – check it out below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's not all, though, because we also have a first look at never-before-seen character sketches for "Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks" from artist Wilton Santos that you can view below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside these character sketches, we have some details for each:&nbsp;</p><h3>Tessalynde (Tess) Halendria: The Rogue – Elf</h3><p><em>Tess is a professional young infiltrator who always has a plan.</em></p><p>Tess was such a proficient thief as a child—and caused so much havoc in her small town—that her overwhelmed parents sent her to the city to train with an elderly halfling rogue famed for her good deeds. Now, with the skills of a master burglar, tempered by the conscience to use them for good, she pursues high-stakes jobs and big-time coin, always striving to keep her party safe.</p><h3>Anson Iro: The Fighter – Human</h3><p><em>Anson always gets back up when he’s knocked down, even if staying down is smarter.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Orphaned at a young age, Anson and his brother were polarized by their boyhood trauma. While Anson chose the path of a righteous warrior, his brother embraced a life of crime. Still, Anson refuses to give up on his only surviving family member. Having lost so much, Anson clings to what’s his, even if it’s broken.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cazrin Varaith: The Wizard – Human</h3><p><em>Cazrin is a walking reference library who enthusiastically shares her knowledge whether you want it or not.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Cazrin’s long-ago ancestress was a wizard who launched devastating attacks on elite institutions of magical learning in the belief that magic should be accessible to all. The horror of these actions prevents the Varaith family from using magic to this day. But Cazrin has taught herself the fundamentals of spellcasting by recovering scraps of her ancestress’s knowledge. A fearless experimenter, she will test any theory in the name of learning.</p><h3>Lark Silverstring: The Bard – Tiefling</h3><p><em>A born showman who attracts attention and trouble in equal measure.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Lark lives to perform. But that’s a problem when he’s being hounded by dangerous bounty hunters and a small but dedicated fanbase. Consumed by the need to entertain, he routinely blows his own cover and must scramble out of the spotlight. As his old band enjoys widespread fame, Lark evades pursuers and questions about who wants him and why.</p><h3>Baldric Goodhand: The Cleric – Dwarf</h3><p><em>A smooth talker who negotiates for spells with a variety of gods.</em></p><p>Baldric’s certain he can talk his way out of anything. Though a man of the cloth, he refuses to pledge service to a single god, preferring to bargain for spells and favors from the entire pantheon. His unconventional relationship with the gods gives him a freewheeling confidence. But while he’s jaded with the divine, his faith in fellow mortals runs deep.</p><hr><p>"In a time of fickle dogs and feckless governors, the world yearns for heroes," a press release about this comic series reads. "What it gets are the Fallbacks – a party of daring, dubious, and dysfunctional adventurers who arrive in the city of Loudwater in search of gold and glory. But an encounter with kobold thieves puts the Fallbacks in the crosshairs of a rival team of deeply annoying local heroes. Will the Fallbacks pull off a heist for the ages? Or will they sacrifice it all to put these 'heroes' in their place?"</p><p>Here's a look at the different covers for Issue #1:&nbsp;</p><p>The Fallbacks begins this October with Issue #1 from Dark Horse Comics.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to be checking out Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Fallbacks in October? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/08/27/dungeons-dragons-the-fallbacks-get-an-exclusive-look-at-new-art-and-character]]></content:encoded>
