            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Resident Evil Requiem is easily one of the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/video-podcast/2026/01/09/drafting-our-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-the-game-informer-show" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76ac02fb-38b3-4fdf-8dc3-0df0a2bcbf85" data-entity-substitution="canonical">most anticipated video games of the year</a>, and luckily, its February release is right around the corner. While a big Game Awards trailer <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem">finally confirmed the rumors that Leon S. Kennedy would be playable</a>, there's still plenty fans don't know about this game. We'll be getting some more news soon, however, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/residentevil.capcomusa.com/post/3mcbhyqjx3s2l">Capcom has just announced</a> a Resident Evil showcase for later this week, January 15, at 2 PM PT/ 5 PM ET.</p><p>The stream will be available on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa">Capcom's Twitch channel</a>. You can also view a short teaser for the event below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VXQveAdzC74" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Tune in on January 15 at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for the Resident Evil Showcase and be one of the first to see brand new gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem," the YouTube description for the trailer reads. Capcom's website also reveals that the stream will be <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/twelve-minutes/twelve-minutes-review-stuck-in-hell">12 minutes</a> long. The event is technically just called "Resident Evil Showcase," implying there might be room for non-Requiem related announcements, but 12 minutes doesn't quite feel like enough time to cover multiple games. We'll know for sure when the showcase airs this Thursday.</p><p>For more Requiem, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/12/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-grace-and-leons-sections-are-almost-equally-split-detail">read about how protagonists Leon and Grace share the spotlight</a>, check out our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/capcom-doesnt-think-of-resident-evil-7-8-and-9-as-a-trilogy">interview with the developers at Gamescom</a>, and then see what we thought about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">how the game feels to play</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/capcom-sets-resident-evil-requiem-showcase-for-thursday]]></content:encoded>
