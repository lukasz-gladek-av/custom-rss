Each game in the Marvel Maximum Collection will also include save states and the ability to rewind. The collection also features various display options to make the games look better on modern displays or to replicate the classic CRT look. A music player will let players enjoy the soundtracks from each title, and a digital archive features high-resolution scans of original box arts, instruction manuals, and original advertisements.&nbsp;</p><p>Marvel Maximum Collection is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Limited Run Games did not provide a release window, only stating the game is "coming soon."
