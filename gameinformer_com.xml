            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After seven months on the market, the Nintendo Switch 2 is finally getting newly colored Joy Cons. Today, via the Nintendo Today app (<a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?s=20">and later on other social media platforms</a>), Nintendo announced that two new Joy Con 2 colors would be hitting shelves on the same day as Mario Tennis Fever, February 12.&nbsp;</p><h2>You can take a look at the new Joy Con 2 colors below:</h2><p>Dubbed "Light Purple" and "Light Green," the new controllers follow the color pattern established by the original Joy Con 2s. Each controller's respective color accents the joystick and connection points, but the shell is still mostly dark gray.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, the only Joy Con 2 colors available were red and blue: the option included with the console. Even this is fewer options than the original Switch, which launched with a Red/Blue model and a gray model. While it's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, if you live in a household with multiple Switch 2s or visit a friend with the console to play some multiplayer, it's hard to tell the handhelds apart. This provides the first official pathway to customization.</p><p>That said, the controllers, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-l-r-light-purple-light-green-127067/?utm_source=HW&amp;utm_campaign=S1001-01&amp;utm_id=S1001-01&amp;utm_content=100009464274542&amp;utm_medium=sofbnoa">which are currently available for pre-order on Nintendo's website</a>, are the same price as red and blue Joy Con 2s – a whopping $99.99. It's a reminder of Nintendo's recently high price tags, though <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/04/nintendo-switch-2-sales-surpass-10-million-units">it hasn't stopped the console itself from having a successful launch</a>. However, a recent report also shared last November <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/17/video-game-hardware-and-physical-software-sales-this-year-had-the-worst-november-since">had the lowest number of consoles sold in a long time</a>, so that aforementioned success depends on your perspective.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/08/new-joy-con-2-colors-will-launch-alongside-mario-tennis-fever-next-month]]></content:encoded>
