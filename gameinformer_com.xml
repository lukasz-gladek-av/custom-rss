            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is an anime-inspired "arcade-flawless" rhythm game that was set to launch tomorrow, on November 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. However, developer D-Cell Games has delayed Unbeatable to next month, just hours before the game's launch, citing a progression-blocking bug that it says must be fixed before release.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unbeatable was supposed to come out tomorrow," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/598542531394797771?l=english">announcement</a> on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> reads. "That's a scary sentence. Here's a worse one: Unbeatable will now release on December 9. I hate that I have to say this. There's no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I'm <em>personally </em>sorry about this and wish it was different."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/ASRfsN8-okg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASRfsN8-okg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The delay announcement features a QA and in the "Why would you only tell me now?" section, D-Cell responds, "Because the decision was only made a few hours ago (No, really, I'm writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the very last-minute delay, D-Cell says, "QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that's serious enough it's considered unreleasable," and that "fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and <em>not </em>fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We're fixing it."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the game is being delayed more than a month to December 9, it is due to other games launching over the next month. D-Cell says the team had a pretty good spot on November 6, "where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a <em>lot </em>to find another island, and [December 9] is the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us some breathing room we didn't have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow."&nbsp;</p><p>Unbeatable will now launch on December 9 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-releases-in-november">check out the Unbeatable reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/05/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-delayed-to-december-hours-before-its-launch]]></content:encoded>
