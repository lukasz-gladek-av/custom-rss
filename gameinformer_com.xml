Developer Team Lazerbeam describes the game as a first-person roguelike double-deckbuilder. Players must work through mysterious fungi-filled dungeons that combine hand-drawn 2D art and animations with 3D exploration.</p><p>The reveal trailer shows how the game’s mechanics work, including why Shroom and Gloom is a “double deck-builder.” The first deck players build is one for exploration, with different cards serving as tools to help advance through dungeons. Then, when it’s time to fight, players use a separate combat deck to take down fungal enemies.</p><p><strong>Check out the double-deck action in the trailer below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Shroom and Gloom allows players to collect new cards and upgrade and modify them “infinitely,” suggesting a lot of customization for players’ decks. After defeating these mushroom foes, you can season, skewer, roast, and ultimately eat them to restore health.</p><p>Team Lazerbeam says its dream version of Shroom and Gloom features “hundreds of cards, deep meta-progression and scores of unique enemies, spread across a dense network of caves and tunnels.” It also says the game is in an early stage of development, but it encourages players to check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271280/Shroom_and_Gloom/">Steam</a>. Notably, Team Lazerbeam released what it calls a Shroom and Gloom "prototype" on itch.io in <a href="https://teamlazerbeam.itch.io/shroom-and-gloom/devlog/798570/we-did-it-shroom-and-gloom-prototype-is-here">September of last year</a> – the <a href="https://teamlazerbeam.itch.io/shroom-and-gloom">page</a> is still up, giving you a chance to check out the original vision and what it is today (pretty identical).&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more about Shroom and Gloom, check out this fresh batch of screenshots below:&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
