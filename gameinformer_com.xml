Alongside the trailer, Rockstar overhauled <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the game's website</a> and added all kinds of new details about the the game's locations and some of the characters you will meet in the game, including its protagonists.</p>



<p>Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos are the aforementioned protagonists. Jason an army vet who works in the Keys for local drug runners, but wants to try something new. Lucia's father trained her as a fighter her whole life and it was apparently fighting for her family that landed her in jail. But in both the GTA VI trailers, we see her regaining her freedom.</p>



<p>Brian Heder is the other character we see early in the trailer. He is an older gentleman that Jason apparently works for. Apparently he and his wife Lori manage the drug running business together. Though it was not confirmed in the trailer, Brian sounds like he is voiced by Stephen Root (<em>Barry</em>, <em>King of the Hill</em>).</p>



<p>Cal Hampton is also seen speaking periodically in the trailer. He is apparently a friend of Jason's and also works for Brian. Though similarly not confirmed in the trailer, it sounds like he is voiced by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s Bobby Moynihan.</p>



<p>Boobie Ike is a well-known and successful Vice City entrepreneur who built a number of legitimate businesses from his crime roots.</p>



<p>Dre'quan Priest is a musician who is "more of a hustler than a gangster" according to his bio.</p>



<p>Bae-Luxe and Roxy together go by Real Dimez. They are high school friends and are heavily invested in social media.</p>



<p>And finally,&nbsp;Raul Bautista is a charming and cunning bank robber.</p>

<p>There will be undoubtedly be many more characters in Grand Theft Auto VI when it releases May 26 of next year, but for now, this is a substantial look at who we can expect to meet in the game.&nbsp;For more GTA 6, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">rewatch its reveal trailer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/humor/2023/12/05/watch-two-florida-men-analyze-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">see what Game Informer's resident Floridians thought about Rockstar's adaptation of their home state</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is the gaming industry's most anticipated game, but after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">last Friday's news that it would be delayed into May of next year</a>, it seemed like it would be a while before we saw any new details about the game. Today, Rockstar decided to surprise the internet once more, but with good news this time: a second trailer. You can check it out below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This trailer spends a bit more time introducing the audience to Jason Duval, the game's male protagonist, by giving us a glimpse into his day to day life. It seems to be as much about showing off the new and improved Vice City, as Jason lifts weights on the beach, cruises down the highway, and avoids police at night. Eventually, he picks up Lucia Caminos, the other protagonist, from prison, and the game wastes no time showing how head over heels they are for each other. It's almost an even split between action shots and intimate romance, further suggesting that GTA VI's story will have a Bonnie and Clyde vibe.</p>

<p>Additionally, developer Rockstar has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">updated its website</a> to include more information and images, including screenshots, new characters, and more. Here's the new synopsis of the game's plot, revealing more of the story's stakes:</p>

<p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida â€” forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is over a year away, giving ravenous fans plenty of time to dissect this new look at the game and mine it for more information. Regardless, we can't wait for May 26 of next year. For more GTA 6, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">rewatch its reveal trailer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/humor/2023/12/05/watch-two-florida-men-analyze-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">see what Game Informer's resident Floridians thought about Rockstar's adaptation of their home state</a>.</p>
