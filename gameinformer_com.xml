Vice City, where the game takes place, has a personality of its own. In addition to new details about the game's story and characters, the GTA VI website has loads of information about the game's new major areas, along with plenty of new screenshots. Here's a breakdown of what we know about each of them.</p>



<p>According to Rockstar's website, the game's central metropolis has "the glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city." Notable locations include Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>



<h2>Leonida Keys</h2>

<p>A clear parody of the Florida Keys, the Leonida Keys are a beachside tropical paradise, complete with retirees, casual boating, and sea turtles. The site's description also describes it as some of the most "dangerous waters in all of America."</p>



<h2>Grassrivers</h2>

<p>This swampy biome is full of danger. Rockstar says it's got even "deadlier predators" than the state's infamous alligators, and based on the screenshots, I can only assume those predators are the wetlands' intimidating, heavily armed residents.</p>



<h2>Port Gellhorn</h2>

<p>This sketchy area used to be a popular vacation spot, but now its stores have been abandoned and its parking lots are filled with "malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks." As a tourist, I'd be scared, but seeing as I'll be playing as two lovers with a penchant for the illegal, it seems like a great spot to make some money.</p>



<h2>Ambrosia</h2>

<p>The "heart of Leonida" is known for its "old school values," factories, and local biker gang. Based on the screenshots, it also looks like the economy partially relies on farms (even if this one is on fire), and the locals rely on some particularly patriotic women to wash their cars.</p>



<h2>Mount Kalaga National Park</h2>

<p>Full of wildlife and wilderness, the National Park is lush with greenery. Rockstar says the park will have "prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails," potentially hinting at some of the series' numerous elaborate minigames.</p>

Alongside the trailer, Rockstar overhauled <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the game's website</a> and added all kinds of new details about the the game's locations and some of the characters you will meet in the game, including its protagonists.</p>



<p>Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos are the aforementioned protagonists. Jason an army vet who works in the Keys for local drug runners, but wants to try something new. Lucia's father trained her as a fighter her whole life and it was apparently fighting for her family that landed her in jail. But in both the GTA VI trailers, we see her regaining her freedom.</p>



<p>Brian Heder is the other character we see early in the trailer. He is an older gentleman that Jason apparently works for. Apparently he and his wife Lori manage the drug running business together. Though it was not confirmed in the trailer, Brian sounds like he is voiced by Stephen Root (<em>Barry</em>, <em>King of the Hill</em>).</p>



<p>Cal Hampton is also seen speaking periodically in the trailer. He is apparently a friend of Jason's and also works for Brian. Though similarly not confirmed in the trailer, it sounds like he is voiced by <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s Bobby Moynihan.</p>



<p>Boobie Ike is a well-known and successful Vice City entrepreneur who built a number of legitimate businesses from his crime roots.</p>



<p>Dre'quan Priest is a musician who is "more of a hustler than a gangster" according to his bio.</p>



<p>Bae-Luxe and Roxy together go by Real Dimez. They are high school friends and are heavily invested in social media.</p>



<p>And finally,&nbsp;Raul Bautista is a charming and cunning bank robber.</p>

<p>There will be undoubtedly be many more characters in Grand Theft Auto VI when it releases May 26 of next year, but for now, this is a substantial look at who we can expect to meet in the game.&nbsp;For more GTA 6, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">rewatch its reveal trailer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/humor/2023/12/05/watch-two-florida-men-analyze-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">see what Game Informer's resident Floridians thought about Rockstar's adaptation of their home state</a>.</p>
