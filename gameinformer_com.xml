            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Xenoblade Chronicles X, like many games, was a good game stuck on the poorly selling Wii U. Last March, it was freed from those confines and ported to the Switch, but since it was only a few months before the launch of the Switch 2, some felt rightfully frustrated that it didn't get the performance boost from the newest console. Today, however, Nintendo not only announced that very upgrade, but you don't have to wait – it's out right now.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LC0XfI25wro"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LC0XfI25wro" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The paid upgrade costs $4.99, and if you don't have a copy of the game yet, you can buy a Switch 2 version for $64.99, an appropriate $5 more than the Switch 1 release. This enhanced version of the game supports a 4K resolution when docked and "smoother framerates" that the above trailer says can go "up to 60 fps," which implies that actual fps values will vary in-game.</p><p>The Xenoblade Chronicles games are a series of RPGs defined by their real-time combat, sci-fi fantasy setting, and massive open worlds. Xenoblade Chronicles X distinguishes itself from the series' other games due to its mechs, which players can use to fight and fly around the world. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_x/b/wii_u/archive/2015/12/04/game-informer-review-xenoblade-chronicles-x.aspx">We gave the original a 7.25</a>, saying, "Players with great patience for grinding are rewarded with intriguing places to discover and creatures to fight, but for me, only a handful of the 100 hours I spent wandering Mira felt like a true adventure."</p><p>For more Xenoblade, check out our reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_2/b/switch/archive/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review-game-informer.aspx">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3/a-dull-knife">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/19/a-paid-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-2-upgrade-is-available-now]]></content:encoded>
