            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Cellar Door Games, the creators of Rogue Legacy 1 and 2, have revealed a substantially different new game called Neath during today’s PC Gaming Show. It’s a dark roguelike tactical RPG coming next year.</p><p>Neath is set in a dying world that has an irradiated, inverted tower looming above it. Players lead a band of fragile warriors up the tower, which holds Taboos, a series of ever-changing edicts from a god that regularly alter the laws of reality.</p><p>Inspired by games like Into the Breach and tabletop games like Mansions of Madness, the grid-based game features what a press release calls a “fluid turn-based system where the turn order is always shifting.” In other words, Neath allows players to control the actions of allies and enemies alike.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>An “engagement-locking” system grips allied units in fear when targeted by foes. It’s up to the player to disrupt enemies. The game’s press release also states that players can “Make trapped chests fizzle, barter with the gods, and reshape destiny with the power of Fate's Die. Encounter special events inspired by classic 90's dungeon-crawlers that reshapes your party during every run. But beware the consequences when playing games with providence.”</p><p>Throughout each run through the tower, players will build their party and learn new abilities, and find powerful relics. Players can discover team synergies to help turn the tide of battles. Outside of tower runs, players will rebuild the small town of Shale into a rich settlement that, in turn, will help them better prepare for future runs.</p><p>Neath will launch in 2026 for PC via Steam. Until then, you can read our reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rogue_legacy/b/pc/archive/2013/07/16/rogue-legacy-review.aspx">Rogue Legacy</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/rogue-legacy-2/generations-of-greatness">Rogue Legacy 2</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/control-your-enemies-and-fate-in-neath-a-roguelike-strategy-game-by-the-creators-of]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Splitgate 2 had a rough launch this June. Fans were unsatisfied with the sequel’s changes, and it suffered a big PR blow from 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">Ian Prolux’s controversial stage presentation</a> during Summer Game Fest. After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-returning-to-beta-following-poor-launch-reception-as-developer-1047-games">unlaunching Splitgate 2 and returning it to beta in July</a> for a substantial rework, the game has reemerged with a new name: Splitgate: Arena Reloaded.</p><p>Launching on December 17, the free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is described as “a revamped online arena FPS from 1047 Games that goes back to its community focused roots,” in a press release. This new version of the portal-jumping competitive shooter ditches the factions and abilities of the original Splitgate 2. It also sports a completely overhauled progression system to create an arena-style experience that hews much closer to the original Splitgate.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Splitgate has always been a love letter to the arena shooters we grew up playing,” said 1047 Games design director Josh Watson in a press release. “We’ve been hard at work rebuilding the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2, removing what didn’t work, and refining what did.”&nbsp;</p><p>Arena Reloaded also introduces five new maps, while six existing maps have been fully reworked. It also features three new primary weapons and a new power weapon, the Railgun. The game also boasts new Arena modes, along with Classic Arena, playlist selection, and an even-starts mode without customizable weapon loadouts. 1047 also promises a simplified battle pass, improved cosmetics, and reduced store prices.</p><p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/splitgate-2-has-been-rebooted-as-splitgate-arena-reloaded-and-it-launches-this-month]]></content:encoded>
