            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Video game hardware and physical software sales just had the worst November since 1995 here in the U.S. That's according to the latest <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w">U.S. Video Game Market report</a> from industry analyst group Circana, with senior director Mat Piscatella revealing that 1.6 million units of hardware and a 14 percent spending decline in physical software led to the worst November in consumer video game spending since 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to note that Piscatella explicitly cites 1995 as the year this kind of tracking began. Monthly hardware spending dropped by 27 percent compared to 2024, down to $695 million, which Piscatella calls "the lowest video game hardware spending total for a November month since the $455 million reached during the November 2005 tracking period," in his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4rms722w">highlights thread</a> on Bluesky. However, when you look at unit sales (rather than spending totals), the 1.6 million hardware units sold during November 2025 across all platforms is the lowest total for a November since 1995, when 1.4 million hardware units were sold. That's especially surprising considering Black Friday is in November, a popular consumer spending holiday in the U.S.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ8hBanNhWg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ8hBanNhWg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That said, the PlayStation 5 was November's best-selling hardware in both units sold and dollar sales, which is the first time this has occurred since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June. Switch 2 ranked second in both categories last month.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of physical software sales, November spending fell 14 percent compared to last November, an all-time low for that month since tracking began in 1995, Piscatella says. However, video game content spending grew by 1 percent compared to a year ago, to $4.8 billion, with a 16 percent increase in subscription spending and 2 percent growth in mobile, which Piscatella says offsets declines in console and PC content spending.&nbsp;</p><p>Diving into the specifics of video game software, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was still the best-selling game of last month, despite fans of the franchise calling it one of the weakest entries in years (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/10/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-release-back-to-back-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">something the devs behind the game recently acknowledged</a>). This marks the 18th consecutive year that a Call of Duty release is the best-selling game of its release month. This streak started with the November 2008 release of Call of Duty: World at War. However, Piscatella says the franchise experienced a "double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline" when compared to November 2024.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmyqN8nDcCQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmyqN8nDcCQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Fortnite was the most-played game in November on PlayStation and Xbox consoles by monthly active users. However, on PC via Steam, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/arc-raiders/consequential-and-worthwhile-multiplayer">Arc Raiders</a> was the most-played game.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of accessories, which are categorized separately from platform consoles, spending fell 13 percent last month compared to November 2024, down to $327 million. Controller spending declined 19 percent year-on-year, driving this 13 percent spending drop. The Midnight Black edition of the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/tech/2023/11/15/is-the-playstation-portal-worth-a-purchase">PlayStation Portal</a> was the best-selling accessory of November in dollar sales, while the Midnight Black PlayStation 5 DualSense controller led the month in unit sales.&nbsp;</p><h3>Here Are The Top 20 Best-Selling Premium Games Of November 2025</h3>

A digital deluxe bundle is also available to pre-order.</p><p>Developer AdHoc Studio has not officially announced that Dispatch is coming to Switch at the time of writing, but these listings seem legit, so we will likely hear about a U.S. release sooner rather than later. &nbsp;We'll update this story accordingly if/when that happens.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dispatch stars Aaron Paul as Robert Robertson, a former superhero turned office dispatcher for a team of reformed supervillains.
