This quirky adventure comes from Nidhogg and Flywrench developer Messhof and has been floating around for some time, but as announced during the PC Gaming Show, it’s finally launching on July 23.</p><p>A new trailer shows off newly revealed locations that the protagonist Kat will traverse atop her bicycle. The game’s plot centers on Kat’s quest to save a universe on the brink of collapse with the aid of ancient cycling spirits. Doing so involves winning races and other cycling challenges against colorful characters while recovering legendary parts to perform a special world-saving ritual called The Great Shift. You can also customize Kat’s bike to tailor it towards your riding style and explore the colorful open world in search of secrets.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-WUWFguRqY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-WUWFguRqY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you’re curious to try Wheel World, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497460/Wheel_World/">Steam demo</a> is available now.

The teams behind Blippo+ revealed this during today's PC Gaming Show, where it released the wildest trailer I've seen in a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>"Blippo+ is a wholly original channel-surfing experience filled with soaps, sitcoms, news, weather, and talk shows – all painstakingly made with vintage analog broadcast equipment and an intergenerational cast of over 100 actors, comedians, performers, and artists," a press release reads. "Television newcomers and nostalgics alike will delight in flipping through Blippo+'s linear broadcast, browsing the robust Electronic Program Guide, tinkering with TV menu settings, and luring the Femtofax videotext forums to unravel the planet-shaking narrative unfolding over the airwaves of Planet Blip."&nbsp;</p><p>Check out Blippo+ for yourself in the new trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKTXT_0RlFM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKTXT_0RlFM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>&nbsp;Unlike the Playdate version of the game, Blippo+ on Switch and PC introduces a time-hopping mechanic that allows viewers to travel back and forth through weeks of TV programming "without losing the magic of 'non-demand' linear viewing." Today's trailer also highlights Blippo+'s use of technicolor source material, as well as a cast made up of local Los Angeles artists.&nbsp;</p><p>Blippo+ is currently available as part of Playdate Season 2, and the color version will launch on Switch and PC sometime this Fall.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
