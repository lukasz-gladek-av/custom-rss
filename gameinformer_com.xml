            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today's Nintendo Partner Direct showcased a rather dense line-up of upcoming third-party games for Switch platforms. Specifically, the Year 1 line-up for Switch 2 received a shot in the arm with several confirmed new titles. If you missed the Direct live, we rounded up every announcement to offer a quick summary of what you missed.&nbsp;</p><h2>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection - 2026 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxR3M-FwlWU?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxR3M-FwlWU?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The next entry in the popular RPG spin-off series tells the tale of two nations gearing up for war, until the birth of a Rathalos, long-thought extinct, gives hope. Unfortunately, it’s born with a twin, signaling a prophecy heralding these beasts as harbingers of civil war and destruction. In addition to Switch 2, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><h2>Once Upon A Katamari - October 24 (Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Wo0qRu5EPM?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Wo0qRu5EPM?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This brand new entry in the popular (and strange) series sees the Prince rolling his signature ball through time itself. To rebuild the night sky, you’ll roll up anything and everything across various eras, such as the Jurassic Period, the Ice Age, and historic Japan. Once Upon a Katamari features new tools such as a magnet to attract nearby objects, a competitive online multiplayer mode called KatamariBall, and a new, original soundtrack. Thankfully, plenty of retuning tracks will appear, as well.</p><h2>Just Dance 2026 Edition - October 14 (Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kTZDfeR-Lg?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kTZDfeR-Lg?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you’ve been looking for a Switch game that lets you dance like a maniac to Smash Mouth’s “All Star”, Just Dance 2026 has you covered. The next entry in the annual rhythm game features 40 new tracks, including Dua Lipa’s “Houdini”, Madonna’s “Hung Up”, and One Republic’s “Counting Stars”. You can also grab a dance partner in the new co-op party mode.</p><h2>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero - November 14 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bx1bXpseMas?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bx1bXpseMas?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 2024 fighting game and new entry in the Tenkaichi series is instantly transmitting to Switch platforms. Now you can bring all 180+ characters (most of which are probably variations of Goku) anywhere you go. Additionally, a free update allows owners of the Switch version (physical and digital) to play the game on Switch 2 with visual enhancements.</p><h2>Plants vs Zombies: Replanted - October 23 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zv1Q0_x93ZM?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zv1Q0_x93ZM?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The original Plants vs Zombies is receiving a much-welcomed and overdue remaster. Replanted cleans up the 2009 classic with crisp HD visuals, meaning the engrossing tower-defense action looks better than ever. You can battle zombies alongside or against a friend in new local co-op and competitive modes.</p><h2>EA Sports FC 26 - September 26 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hWLWuJwAr8?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hWLWuJwAr8?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>EA’s flagship soccer game is coming to Switch 2, bringing with it overhauled gameplay, new Manager Live Challenges, and more to the hybrid platform.</p><h2>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac - September 26 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZ1ZxEH7pyY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZ1ZxEH7pyY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Following in the footsteps of its 2022 predecessor, Pac-Man World 2 is getting the modernized Re-Pac treatment. The 2002 sequel has been rebuilt from scratch with improved graphics and gameplay.</p><h2>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles - September 30 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMx8pAVmIcU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMx8pAVmIcU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Square Enix provided a new look at its upcoming remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics, this time focusing on the game’s story and improved presentation, such as its full voice acting.</p><h2>Persona 3 Reload - October 23 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 2024 remake of Persona 3, the Persona game that arguably established its format and the current popularity the series appreciates, is making its way to Switch 2. Since its release on other platforms, the game has received some substantial DLC, and it’s unclear if the Switch 2 version will include that content.</p><h2>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - Winter (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HYvrJKLQ38"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HYvrJKLQ38" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo didn’t have much new to offer for the next game in the Hyrule Warriors franchise, other than a new trailer with new gameplay. We don’t know when it will release beyond the vague Winter window, but for Zelda fans, there was some interesting wording. They specifically used the word “canonical” when referring to the game’s story. The previous Hyrule Warriors game, Age of Calamity, was more or less not canon, which led to a very underwhelming conclusion for the game.</p>

<p>So far, the trailers for Age of Imprisonment have not featured Link at all, which, considering the timeline of the game, makes sense. But the tease at the end of the trailer could potentially be a reference to the Ancient Hero. I won’t go into detail on what that means here, but if you don’t mind some very, very late game (like well after you’ve beaten the game) spoilers for Tears of the Kingdom, you can head here.</p><h2>Madden NFL 26 - August 14 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnFJDh4-9w8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnFJDh4-9w8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The annual football game finally returns to Nintendo hardware. Madden NFL 26 launches on Switch 2 on August 14. Footage shown during the presentation offered the first look at gameplay on Switch 2. You can check out the trailer above.</p><h2>Chillin’ by the Fire - July 31 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Arguably, one of the stranger announcements made during the partner showcase. The oddly titled, but undeniably accurate, Chillin’ by the Fire tasks players with building and maintaining a campfire. You can also invite friends to hang out via cha,t and if they have a camera, they’re faces can float around with you.</p><h2>Apex Legends - August 5 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEFU0cGvsE8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEFU0cGvsE8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Respawn Entertainment’s popular free-to-play battle royale game is coming to Switch 2, and it is arriving soon. The game will be available on August 5 to coincide with the new season and will feature a number of technical improvements over the Switch version.</p><h2>Hela - 2026 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHRSSNzjDB0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHRSSNzjDB0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In Hela, players control a mouse gathering materials to create a cure for their witch. The game looks adorable and will feature online co-op. No release date was offered, though, but we can apparently expect it next year on Switch 2.</p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws - September 4 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMQwC4I4njo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMQwC4I4njo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Ubisoft’s open-world Star Wars game arrives on Switch 2 on September 4. Gameplay of the Switch 2 version of the game was shown, and it appears some downgrades have been made for the game to run on Nintendo’s console.</p><h2>Cronos: The New Dawn - September 5 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91BaLCOQa24"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91BaLCOQa24" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn launches on Switch 2 on September 5. You can read more about that announcement <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-coming-to-switch-2-in-september">here</a>.</p><h2>Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 - November 11 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhdP1siwpsA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhdP1siwpsA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The remakes of the first two Yakuza games are coming to Switch 2, which makes sense considering the consoles launched with Yakuza 0. Both games launch on Switch 2 on November 13. They can be purchased separately or in a bundle. Both will have enhanced graphics, improved framerrates, and additional language support.</p><hr><p>During the showcase, Nintendo spent the penultimate announcement section highlighting a number of games back-to-back in quick succession. Goodnight Universe, the next game from the creators of Before Your Eyes that follows a telekinetic baby, is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on November 11.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSt39CIsdIM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSt39CIsdIM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>NBA Bounce, which looks like an NBA Jam-esque arcade basketball game where you can play as team mascots, is coming to Switch on September 26.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfapVIHdRnA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfapVIHdRnA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Hello Kitty Island Adventure’s Wheatflour Wonderland DLC is coming to Switch this Fall.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYeNs5I9v1I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BYeNs5I9v1I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Romancing Saga 2: Revenge of the Seven is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 edition today.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0vn1PHoSnM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0vn1PHoSnM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is releasing on Switch on August 29, and a playable demo is available now.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ku2PiXkpJs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ku2PiXkpJs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo also offered a reminder that Borderlands 4 launches on Switch 2 on October 3.</p><hr><h2>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales - 2026 (Switch 2)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u-zycj_tJgo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u-zycj_tJgo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Square Enix is readying a new HD-2D game, but as opposed to its previous efforts like Octopath Traveller or the Live A Live remake, this game is an action-RPG. The game follows the titular Elliott and his fairy friend Faie as they battle with various close-and long-range weapons across the world of Philabieldia. The game will offer local co-op where a second player can control Faie.</p><p>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales launches on Switch 2 on 2026.</p><h2>Octopath Traveller 0 - December 4 (Switch 2, Switch)</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENHXHzvMx-g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENHXHzvMx-g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The next Octopath game, with a “Zero” subtitle, is coming to Switch 2 on December 4.
