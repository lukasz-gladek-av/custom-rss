            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the best perks of owning a Switch 2 is its exclusive <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">GameCube library</a> on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The service launched with three titles, and we’re getting our first new addition in the form of Super Mario Strikers next week.</p><p>Super Mario Strikers originally launched on GameCube in 2005 (making 2025 its 20th anniversary), and is an extreme soccer game starring the cast of the Mushroom Kingdom. The arcade-style sports title sees players executing over-the-top special shots and maneuvers, and features various game modes such as Grudge Match, Cup Battles, and Custom Battles. Like Mario Kart, players can use items such as shells and mushrooms to turn the tide of a match.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's worth noting that Strikers was one of the confirmed "coming soon" titles shown during the GameCube library announcement trailer. Other titles shown that are slated to arrive in the near future (by Switch Online standards) include Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chibi-Robo, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokémon Colosseum.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can play Super Mario Strikers when it arrives on July 3. It joins the already available The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will bring new creatures to hunt, new weapons to forge, and new ways to deck out your hunter on Monday, June 30. A presentation during Capcom Spotlight last night detailed what the update has in store, while also teasing what’s to come in the months after.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, director Yuya Tokuda, and art/executive director Kaname Fujioka revealed that Lagiacrus, a beast that debuted in Monster Hunter 3 Tri and last appeared in Monster Hunter Generations, will make its return in Wilds. You can watch the lengthy presentation at the 24:10 mark.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/omnl-EMxfYE?si=4I9NoMVVRcbwskHM" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As an aquatic creature, his inclusion introduces more underwater portions to the game, as well as exclusive new actions to defend yourself while submerged. Don’t worry, though, you’ll also spend plenty of time on land fighting it. Slaying Lagiacrus rewards new materials to forge themed weapons and armor.&nbsp;</p><p>Lagiacrus won’t be coming alone. Joining it is Seregios, a creature from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate who has been revamped for Wilds. Battling Lagiacrus and Seregios will appear as 8-star tempered monsters that require a minimum Hunting Rank of 31 and completion of the main mission “A World Turned Upside Down.” For Lagiacrus, players must also complete the side mission “Forest Doshaguma.”</p>

<p>In terms of crafting, Title Update 2 also lets players craft the final weapon in a tree to unlock its design as a layered weapon. New photo mode options are on the way, such as brightness settings and filter effects, and the ability to hide their Handler, Palico, and Seikret in the Character Display tab. Players will also have the option to choose which Support Hunters they bring to their party. Finally, the update introduces new paid and free DLC, such as four free dance gestures and the premium Cosmetic DLC Pack 2.</p><p>Looking ahead to the future, Capcom also teased the arrival of Arch-tempered Uth Duna on July 30. This creature will appear as a limited-time event quest and a free challenge quest, available at HR50.</p><p>Before that, on July 23, The Festival of Accord: Flamefete seasonal celebration kicks off. It will feature limited-time Grand Hub decorations, meals, gestures, equipment, and more. The Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster guitar created by Fender for the series’ 20th anniversary will also reappear in the game starting on August 27. Lastly, we get a tease for Title Update 3, slated to arrive in September.</p><p>For more on Monster Hunter Wilds, check out our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds/happy-hunting-playground">review</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-features-returning-beasts-new-cosmetic-options-and]]></content:encoded>
