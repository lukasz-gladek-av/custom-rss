            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-is-removing-over-20-games-including-hades-and-monument-valley-123023128.html"><em>Engadget</em></a>, Netflix is removing over 20 games from its mobile library next month. The list of titles on the chopping block includes heavy hitters like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hades/hades-review-the-highs-and-lows-of-repetition">Hades</a>, the Monument Valley series, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/deaths-door/deaths-door-review-reaping-the-rewards">Death’s Door</a>.</p><p>On July 15, 22 titles, which require a Netflix subscription to play, will exit the service. Some games, such as Hades, were only available on mobile devices through Netflix, so it’s unclear if they’ll become available on other mobile storefronts. Although July 15 is the removal date, some titles will disappear before then (such as Hades, exiting on July 1). Here’s the full list of games making their exit:</p><ul><li>Battleship</li><li>Braid, Anniversary Edition</li><li>Carmen Sandiego</li><li>CoComelon: Play with JJ</li><li>Death’s Door</li><li>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</li><li>Dumb Ways to Die</li><li>Ghost Detective</li><li>Hades (available only on iOS)</li><li>Katana Zero</li><li>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</li><li>Ludo King</li><li>Monument Valley</li><li>Monument Valley 2</li><li>Monument Valley 3</li><li>Rainbow Six: SMOL</li><li>Raji: An Ancient Epic</li><li>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</li><li>TED Tumblewords</li><li>The Case of the Golden Idol</li><li>The Rise of the Golden Idol</li><li>Vineyard Valley</li></ul><p>Netflix’s entire mobile library consists of 114 games, which means roughly 20 percent of its library is disappearing. While this isn't the first time games have been delisted from the mobile library, these removals come as some question Netflix Games' long-term future.</p><p>Last October, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-has-closed-its-aaa-gaming-studio-133014946.html">shut down its triple-A game development studio</a> in Southern California, leading to the departures of several high-profile talents only a few months after the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-games-engagement-tripled-in-the-last-year-in-part-thanks-to-gta">expressed optimism</a> about its games division. In January, the company <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/">canceled plans </a>to bring previously announced titles to the service, including Thirsty Suitors, Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, and Don't Starve Together. In February, &nbsp;Netflix <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">laid off staff</a> at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio, which it acquired in 2021. The streaming giant has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663933/netflix-black-mirror-bandersnatch-kimmy-schmidt-removal">scaled back on interactive programming</a>, removing shows such as <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em>. &nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/25/netflix-is-delisting-over-20-games-from-its-mobile-library-next-month-including-hades]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PixelJunk developer Q-Games’ next title is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAdoJXfLzgE">Dreams of Another</a>, a surrealist shooter in which players use guns to create the world around them rather than destroy it. After unveiling the game’s standard PlayStation 5 gameplay during a State of Play in February, today the studio revealed footage of how the game’s unique mechanics translate to PlayStation VR2.</p><p>Dreams of Another is a third-person shooter and the brainchild of PixelJunk Eden director, Baiyon. The experience revolves around the theme of “No Creation Without Destruction”, with players following two characters, “The Man in Pajamas” and the “Wandering Soldier,” exploring a dream-like world made from particles. Both utilize standard weapons, including an assault rifle, grenades, and even an RPG, that cause new objects to materialize in the world; shooting can create new walls, trees, or doorways, for example. As players explore the imaginations of both characters, they’ll witness their memories to learn about their interwoven stories while interacting with a strange cast of characters.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gE5Wfc99voE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gE5Wfc99voE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The PlayStation VR2 version allows players to switch between first-person and the standard third-person perspective. The VR version takes advantage of eye-tracking to let players shoot something simply by looking at it. A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/24/dreams-of-another-ps-vr2-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> by Q-Games recommended using the DualSense controller while playing in third-person and the PS VR2 Sense controllers for first-person play.</p><p>Dreams of Another is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/25/pixeljunk-studio-unveils-ps-vr2-gameplay-for-its-surreal-creation-shooter-dreams-of]]></content:encoded>
