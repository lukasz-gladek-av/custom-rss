            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam Next Fest is happening right now, which is where developers releasing games on Steam all agree to launch demos of their games to encourage Wishlist additions and give players an excuse to check out games early. We have not played all the Steam Next Fest demos. There are a lot. But here are a few that we've played and enjoyed.</p><h2>Replaced</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niPUvgTgnI8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niPUvgTgnI8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The quick pitch here is Cyberpunk aesthetics, Limbo/Inside cinematic platformer puzzles and mood, and Batman Arkham combat. It seems to be a potent mix that is already really impressing us. You can watch us play and discuss the demo above.</p><h2>Denshattack</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGk7sIPzvQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGk7sIPzvQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Denshattack is a game that demos very, very well. In it, you control a train that can leap and stunt between tracks in a sort-of-post-apoclyptic Japan as you try to be the best train race trick performer in the world. It plays like a modern Dreamcast game and it's very cool. You can watch us play it above.</p><h2>Planet of Lana II</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTDTuPl56G8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTDTuPl56G8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unlike the other two games listed here, Planet of Lana II is a bit more of a known quantity, as any sequel is. I mentioned Limbo/Inside above and Planet of Lana II takes heavy inspiration from those games, and does it well. The sequel is shaping up to be a worthwhile follow-up to the first game and you can check out the demo with us above.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/20/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-20]]></content:encoded>
