            <p>The Game Awards may be one of the biggest events of the year, but I have just as much excitement from the indie event that precedes it, Day of the Devs. Seeing such innovative games from a wide range of indie developers makes me optimistic about the future of the industry, and this year was no exception. If you missed the latest showcase, here's a recap of every game shown in order of appearance.</p>
