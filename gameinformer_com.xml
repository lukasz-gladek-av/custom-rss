Mario Kart World will be available, but among the other few original titles is a game called <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a>. You'd be forgiven for not knowing it is actually part of a larger series. The first game in the series released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color and shared the name of the upcoming Swtich 2 sequel, Survival Kids. It received a Game Boy sequel and then the series continued on DS and Wii where it had a different name, Lost in Blue.</p><p>A few days ago, Survival Kids was added to the Nintendo Online Game Boy library alongside Gradius The Interstellar Assault, Kirby's Star Stacker, and The Sword of Hope.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Survival Kids, the original game, is a well-liked, innovative title that borrowed ideas from titles like Zelda and Pok√©mon to create a survival game on a small scale years before the genre became a popular standard. Game Informer scored it a 7.5/10 when it released.</p><p>Physical copies of the game are also quite rare. According to <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/gameboy-color/survival-kids">pricecharting.com</a>, boxed copies of game typically sell for about $430. It's nice to see Nintendo and publisher Konami recognizing potential upcoming interest in the series and making the original game available on Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
