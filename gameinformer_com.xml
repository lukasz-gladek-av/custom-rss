            <div property="schema:text"><p>The <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/six-one-indie-showcase-returns-next-week-with-48-games-including-mouse-pi-for-hire-and">Six One Indie Showcase</a> just wrapped, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase">highlighting more than 40 rad indie games</a> with world premieres, exclusive reveals, and more. It was this year’s best indie game showcase and one of my favorites ever, which is why it’s exciting to see the team behind it announce its new publishing arm: Six One Publishing.</p><p>Coming from the Six One Indie team, Six One Publishing was “created for developers who need an impactful partner to help them cross the finish line.” The team describes itself as an “integrated, indie-first platform” that aims to reimagine what publishing can look like in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>“We’re here to blur the lines,” Six One Publishing creative director Mike Towndrow writes in a press release. “The number of games hitting the market grows by the day, but unfortunately, the people to cover and amplify them seem to dwindle just as fast. Six One Indie has evolved into an ecosystem that can now offer a unique opportunity to get indies in front of players through fresh, unconventional means.”</p><p>Six One Publishing says working with it means “gaining direct access to every part of the Six One ecosystem – from original video content and editorials to our growing slate of indie showcases and creator collabs. By fusing the best parts of publishing, media, and community into one agile framework, we’re rewriting the rulebook to serve developers – not shareholders.”</p><p>Towndrow concludes the press release by stating he believes indies "deserve a major push backed by authenticity, genuine enthusiasm, and a new approach for an unpredictable industry.”</p><p>If you want an idea of the types of indies Six One Indie wants to get eyes on, look no further than <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase"><em>Game Informer’s</em> round-up of every game shown during today’s Six One Indie Showcase</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/05/22/exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-reveals-three-new-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Crossovers with other popular IPs are no strangers to Wizards of the Coast's long-running trading card game, Magic: The Gathering. From Stranger Things and The Lord of the Rings to Assassin's Creed and Street Fighter, Magic: The Gathering fans have had ample ways to simultaneously celebrate their fandom of both the beloved TCG and other franchises. The Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy set is the latest in the long-running TCG's collaborations, and it feels like one of the more popular and anticipated crossovers in recent memory.</p><p>In the lead-up to the Final Fantasy set's June launch, we've seen several reveals of iconic characters like Sephiroth, Lightning, Yuna, Clive, and others from across the entire Final Fantasy series. Today, <em>Game Informer </em>can exclusively reveal three more cards coming to the Final Fantasy set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reach the Horizon</strong> features art of the core cast of Final Fantasy VII staring off into the distance, with a quote from Tifa at the bottom. It allows you to search for up to two distinct basic land and/or Town cards and put them into the battlefield. Also from Final Fantasy VII is the <strong>Weapons Vendor</strong>, which lets you draw a card, and at the beginning of your turn, you can pay one Mana, allowing you to attach Equipment to a creature you control. The final card we're able to reveal comes from the original Final Fantasy, <strong>World Map</strong>. When sacrificed, you can search your library for land cards to put into your hand.</p><p><strong>You can see all three of these cards exclusively in the gallery below:</strong></p><p>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy is scheduled to arrive on store shelves on June 13. The set will be available for purchase through various bundles, packs, and kits. For more information straight from Wizards of the Coast and information on how to get your hands on the Final Fantasy collection, head to the official website <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/final-fantasy">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
