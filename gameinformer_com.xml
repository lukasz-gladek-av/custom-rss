            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel.</p><p>Per <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-1236262719/"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>, scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it's not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ <a href="https://gameinformer.com/series-review/2024/04/22/knuckles-show-review-a-low-stakes-climb"><em>Knuckles</em></a> series?&nbsp; Let us know what you think in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/paramount-announces-a-new-sonic-universe-film-for-holiday-2028]]></content:encoded>
