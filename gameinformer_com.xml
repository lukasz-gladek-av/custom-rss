            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has announced a Switch 2 edition of the hit 2020 game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons/a-wholesome-island-oasis-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. Like previous Switch 2 editions of original Switch games, New Horizons will be bolstered with new next-gen features and additional content. Nintendo is also bolstering New Horizons with a huge content update next year for both versions of the game, introducing a new destination, brand collaborations, and more.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h2>Switch 2 Edition Features</h2><p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Switch 2 Edition launches digitally and physically on January 15 for $64.99; existing owners can buy an upgrade pack for $4.99. This version boasts improvements such as higher-resolution visuals (4K while docked), and players can utilize the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls to more intuitively interact with mechanics like decorating, writing bulletin board messages, and creating custom designs.</p><p>A new in-game megaphone (purchased at Nook’s Cranny) utilizes the console’s built-in microphone, allowing players to locate residents by verbally calling them. Animal Crossing on Switch 2 also supports 12-player online sessions, but only with players who are also playing on the same hardware (meaning original Switch owners cannot join). Speaking of playing with friends, CameraPlay allows users to see each other’s faces while playing together, similar to how the feature is used in Mario Kart World.</p>

<h2>Free Content Update Ver. 3.0</h2><p>A free content update (Ver. 3.0) also arrives on January 15 for the Switch and Switch 2 versions of New Horizons that introduces a resort hotel run by Kapp ‘n’s family. Opening on the pier, this destination lets players bring guests from off the island and you’ll decorate their hotel rooms with various themes, find new furniture and clothing at the souvenir shop, and dress mannequins with outfits that guests can wear.</p><p>Additionally, the update sees Mr. Resetti return with the new Reset Service, which instantly cleans and/or stores placed items around your home, the beach, or the entire island. Home Storage will be upgraded to hold 9,000 items and players can now store trees, shrubs, and flowers there.</p><p>While sleeping, players can visit Luna’s New Dream World, which whisks them to the new Slumber Island destination. This allows players with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to design a special island from scratch. You can save up to three Slumber Islands, which can be populated with residents from your home island. Perhaps the most appealing aspect of Slumber Island is that other players – several, in fact – can visit and help decorate their friends’ Slumber Islands; the trailer shows upwards of six buddies terraforming and decorating a Slumber Island together.</p><p>Nintendo is introducing new items based on several collaborations. First, it’s tapping into its own history with new items modeled after Nintendo hardware. From the Famicom and Switch 2 to more obscure items like the Ultra Hand and even the Love Tester, players can purchase these items at the souvenir store. Switch Online subscribers can even interact with certain consoles to play classic titles such as Ice Climbers and Dr. Mario.</p><p>A collaboration with Lego brings new Lego versions of items such as the workbench, beds, clothing, and much more. These come in various color combinations.</p><p>Scanning select Zelda amiibo introduces new themed furniture and decor, such as a Zonai authenticator from Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom, rupees and heart tanks, outfits and hairstyles based on Link, and other fun references to multiple Zelda titles. Lastly, two Zelda characters can visit and become residents of your island: Tulin and Mineru from Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p>Like Zelda, using select Splatoon amiibo allows new versions of Cece and Viché (introduced in Animal Crossing: New Leaf’s Welcome Amiibo update) to visit the island, who now sport designs modeled after Splatoon characters. Splatoon items will also become available for purchase.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Will you be jumping back into Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch 2 or to check out the new update?
