            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The nominations list for the 2026 Grammy awards dropped recently, renewing the fierce yearly debates over what should win, what should lose, and what was snubbed entirely. In the gaming space, this is no different, as this year marks the fourth time soundtracks for video games and other interactive media are eligible for their own category. If you haven't seen the full list yet, here are this year's nominees.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/tripping-through-jungles">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - Secrets of the Spires (composed by Pinar Toprak)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> (composed by Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/worthy-of-a-museum">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> (composed by Gordy Haab)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-outlaws/transitional-open-world-approach">Star Wars Outlaws</a>: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate's Fortune (composed by Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sword-of-the-sea/beauty-for-the-sake-of-beauty">Sword of the Sea</a> (composed by Austin Wintory)</li></ul><p>If you've been paying attention to the games industry this year, there are a few elements of this list that feel off. The first is the release dates; three of the five games (namely Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Helldivers 2, and Star Wars Outlaws) fall squarely out of the typical nomination window, which includes releases between August 31, 2024 and August 30, 2025. The catch, however, is that Avatar and Star Wars games got nominations for their DLC packs, which were released more recently – each base game was already nominated last year. As for Helldivers II, a game released in February 2024, my guess is that it's eligible because of its Xbox port this past August.&nbsp;</p><p>These sorts of timeline shenanigans aren't unheard of with Grammys, even in major categories. For example, Wildflower by Billie Eilish was released on an album in May 2024, but because it was re-released as a single in February 2025, it's up for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at this year's awards.</p><p>The other way this feels off, however, is the relative impact of each soundtrack across video game culture. Star Wars and Avatar feel out of place in this regard as well, as both games are relatively well-regarded but didn't have the same impact among gamers, and that sentiment extends to their soundtracks. Neither was nominated for best music at last year's game awards, for example. But less egregious than their inclusion means the exclusion of other huge games, most notably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's a big enough deal that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/awintory.bsky.social/post/3m52iiiczks2h">nominee Austin Wintory called it out on social media</a>, even offering to trade his place for the smash-hit RPG. While we do think it's an oversight, Wintory's inclusion is no surprise, as he's currently tied for the most nominations in the category since its first year. You can read more on his background and approach to composition in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/06/24/the-music-had-to-come-from-somewhere" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee2da82-3f52-4203-9f3f-47961c40cda2" data-entity-substitution="canonical">this interview from earlier this year</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vo1By2krjCY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vo1By2krjCY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The other video game-specific news from this year's Grammy nominations is that <a href="https://www.the8bitbigband.com/">The 8-Bit Big Band</a>, a jazz group that does covers of video game music, has been nominated in non-gaming categories for the third year. Its recent album, <a href="https://the8bitbigband.bandcamp.com/album/album-5-orchestrator-emulator"><em>Orchestra Emulator</em></a>, is up for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album, while the song "Super Mario Praise Break" is up for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella. While it's very exciting to see video game soundtracks get recognized in a dedicated category, it's also exciting to see classic game songs break into more mainstream categories.</p><p><a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank">You can read the full list of nominees for this year's Grammy Awards here</a>.

Reimagined is faithful in some respects, but <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/DRAGON-QUEST-VII-REIMAGINED-A-BOLD-NEW-REMAKE-OF-THE-RPG-CLASSIC-LAUNC">Square Enix has been very clear</a> that it's meant to be a more streamlined way to play through the 100-plus-hour story of Dragon Quest VII, and it does so by streamlining the main scenario to take considerably less time to complete.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is also doing some interesting things in combat to bring the play clock down a bit, but for this feature, let's dive into how Square Enix is reshaping the story of Dragon Quest VII to be more digestible. Contrary to what you might think, the Reimagined team didn't start by figuring out what to cut.&nbsp;</p><h3>Streamlining</h3>

<p>"We didn't really have specific discussions about which parts we wanted to remove from the game," Reimagined lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi tells me within Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices, a day after I played through roughly two hours of this remake. "We actually never had any discussions, or like proactive discussions at least, about which parts we wanted to remove from the game, but we did have an extensive discussion about which parts we wanted to keep in the Reimagined version."</p><p>Takagi says one of the big themes of Dragon Quest VII's story is how it depicts these characters – like Hero, Prince Kiefer, Aishe, Maribel, Ruff, and Sir Mervyn – as facing significant adversity. "But another core theme of the story is that it also portrays the humanity of people in its characters, so with these two core elements in mind, we tried to understand all the essential stories of Dragon Quest VII that we wanted to keep."&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't played a Dragon Quest VII version before, the game certainly has an overarching story, but it's divided into subplots or arcs, if you will. Those "essential stories" Takagi is referring to are the game's various arcs and how they weave in and out of the main story. With this in mind, Takagi and the team asked other staff members developing the game and throughout Square Enix to lay out their ideas, favorite story moments, and more. "There were a lot of people saying, 'When I was playing this as a kid, I didn't really understand what the story was,' or, 'I don't really understand what the themes are, but for some reason, it's stuck in my head because it's very memorable,'" Takagi says. "So we laid out a lot of them, a lot of these story moments that fit this description, that criteria, and worked toward keeping those stories in the Reimagined version."</p>

<p>She adds that in this process, the team also identified many story moments that didn't align with Square Enix's vision for Reimagined. Narratively, that vision includes giving players some choice in determining how they tackle the story of Dragon Quest VII. In the original release, the island-hopping story is quite linear, but in Reimagined, players have some options to shape which direction they go.&nbsp;</p><p>"They get to choose which island they want to go to next, and in the original release, it wasn't really like that; the story moments were dependent on the order," Takagi adds. "[Because of the original's fixed story order], some of the story moments didn't make sense if we were to keep that in Reimagined [...] because in the Reimagined version, we allow players to choose which story they want to move forward with." Those story moments that didn't make sense were lowered in priority and eventually cut from Reimagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can actually see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">a new, never-before-seen conclusion</a> as a result of these new choices present within Reimagined's scenario, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rebuilding</h3>

<p>All this said, Square Enix tells me the core of Dragon Quest VII's story remains intact in Reimagined. In fact, Takagi says the scenario is the one piece of Reimagined that wasn't built from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>"While our goal was to reimagine everything and revamp everything from the ground up, [...] it was never our intention to put forth significant changes to the story from the original work," she says. "Obviously, we wanted to respect and honor the original work, and we wanted to kind of maximize how amazing it was. So yeah, we remade everything from the ground up, but as for the story, it was more like rebuilding, taking it piece by piece. We never started from zero."&nbsp;</p><p>I ask if that means putting the original script on a desk and taking what the team likes and leaving behind what it doesn't, to which Takagi says no. "It wasn't really like putting the original dialogue or original scenario side-by-side and going off of that," she says. "What we did was we started with the overview of the plot – the shorter version of the entire scenario of Dragon Quest VII – and laid out some ideas of what we could do to make the story more interesting."</p><p>She says it was like creating a puzzle that the team then had to build, and it did so by switching up the order of story sequences, rewriting dialogue, reshaping plot points, and more. Each time it made a change —like switching the order of a story sequence — it required the team to examine how that affected dialogue and other aspects of the scenario, which led to cascading adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
