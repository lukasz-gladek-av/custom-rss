            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie's extraction FPS, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marathon">Marathon</a>, is right around the corner, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/marathon-launches-in-early-march">launching next week on March 5</a> on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Ahead of its launch, the studio is holding a "Server Slam," <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/24/you-can-play-two-upcoming-playstation-first-party-games-early-this-weekend">essentially an open playtest for anyone to hop into and get a feel for the game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The slam begins in just a few hours, and ahead of it, Marathon game director Joe Ziegler has <a href="https://x.com/Ziegler_Dev/status/2026971692896338372?s=20">shared</a> 11 tips for beginners to keep in mind, as spotted by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/02/26/11-marathon-server-slam-tips-from-the-game-director-himself/"><em>Forbes</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><strong>Here's what they are, edited by </strong><em><strong>Game Informer </strong></em><strong>for clarity:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Gear comes and goes – don't be too precious about it, but learn to use what you go and it will serve you.</li><li>Remember to bring enough ammo and consumables to survive a couple of fights. If you don't have much, then use a sponsored kit or play as Rook [one of the game's six Runner shells designed for solo players looking to scavenge the battlefield and stay out of trouble] and focus your runs on getting gear and creds or stocking up on resources.</li><li>If you're learning, don't rush your contract objectives; playing slowly can help you avoid getting overwhelmed.</li><li>Keep your ears open. You will often hear threats before you see them.</li><li>Try to take the fight you think you can win – you don't need to fight everything. Greed and ambition can lead to a quick downfall.</li><li>Don't sleep on battery weapons – in the right hands, they are strong, but remember that if you reload with them before they're empty, you will lose the battery.</li><li>A friend who plays Triage (another Runner shell that is basically a medic for your trio) is a keeper. Be kind to them.</li><li>If you want to win a fight, use what your opponent wants against them. Patience and cunning are powerful allies.</li><li>Stray Rooks are unpredictable and can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how you treat them.</li><li>Don't get tilted – cooler heads make smarter decisions.</li><li>If all else fails, beg for mercy in proximity chat and hope someone listens.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I'm sure we'll all learn plenty more as we head to the Tau Ceti planet that Marathon's maps are set on, but for now, Ziegler's tips seem like a great foundation of tricks to build on.&nbsp;</p><p>The Marathon Server Slam begins today, February 26, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET, and ends on Monday, March 2, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET.
