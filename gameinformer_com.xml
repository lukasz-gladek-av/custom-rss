            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/extended-clockwork-revolution-showcase-highlights-action-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today’s Xbox Games Showcase came with a new and extended video highlighting Clockwork Revolution from inXile Entertainment. The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-steampunk-rpg-from-the-makers">first announced</a> at this same Xbox Games Showcase back in 2023, but today’s presentation offered a much deeper look at what we can expect.&nbsp;</p><p>In Clockwork Revolution, players take on the role of a customized character named Morgan Vanette, who lives in a seemingly steampunk-inspired alternate history of 1895, in the city of Avalon in a neighborhood called The Tangle. Part of a gang known as the Rotten Row Hooligans, Morgan navigates a world populated both by people and clockwork individuals, and some that seem halfway between the two.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Gameplay shows off plenty of sneaking and combat, as well as some extensive customization tools for both character visuals and weapons. But the most intriguing gameplay shows off special time powers that let Morgan do things like rewind time, rebuild destroyed structures, slow down enemy bullets, and in a larger sense, rewrite the flow of history.</p><p>There’s no word yet on when we can expect Clockwork Revolution to arrive, but the game is targeting a launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The difficult 2D platformer was a popular game on the platform, and though it has never received a proper numbered sequel, it has been given a few spin-offs like Super Meat Boy Forever and Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtXRCarKd9A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtXRCarKd9A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Super Meat Boy 3D, however, looks to be its biggest follow-up yet. The game is fully 3D and looks every bit as challenging as the games that preceded it. It also features the ghosts of previous attempts, which is a staple for the series.</p><p>The game is apparently being developed by Sluggerfly (Hell Pie), Headup Games (Casual Loop), and Team Meat.</p><p>The game is coming coming Xbox Platforms early next year.</p>
