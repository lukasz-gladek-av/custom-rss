Set in 2035, more than 40 years after last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Black Ops 7 features a story campaign that can be played solo or in a squad with friends, reminiscent of 2015's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/call_of_duty_black_ops_iii/b/playstation4/archive/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii-review-game-informer.aspx">Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</a>. Plus, it seemingly stars Milo Ventimiglia (<em>This Is Us, Heroes</em>) as the main protagonist.&nbsp;</p><p>Treyarch says Black Ops 7 is the "next evolution of Black Ops," and is the first-ever consecutive release within this subseries of Call of Duty. "The year is 2035 and the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare following the events of Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6," a press release reads. "Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponized fear above all else."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Black Ops 7 will feature a "thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, a multiplayer experience packed with near-future weaponry, new maps, and more, and of course, another chapter in the round-based Zombies mode (set in the Dark Aether storyline, no less).&nbsp;</p><p>Treyarch says today's cinematic teaser is "only the beginning," with a full reveal of Black Ops 7 later this summer. In the meantime, it says players should look out for teases, clues, and surprises for more about the gam.&nbsp;</p><p>Black Ops 7 is scheduled for release this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Xbox PC, Battle.net, and Steam. It will be available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass on day one.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read up on everything last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> offered Call of Duty players.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to hop into Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year?

Luckily, there was still some time for the little things, as we got a reveal for a sequel to Planet of Lana. Check out the trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBSApS3A37U"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBSApS3A37U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Subtitled "Children of the Leaf," Planet of Lana II looks to be a pretty reasonable sequel, bringing the first game's signature art style and gameplay to new environments to tell a new story. According to the YouTube description of the game's reveal trailer, this new game "doubles the size and scope of the original," which would make it a much more substantial package compared to Planet of Lana's modest four to five hour playtime.</p><p>While the game was announced during an Xbox specific event, <a href="https://x.com/wishfully_games/status/1931773708189766052?s=46">a post from developer Wishfully's X account</a> says the game will also be coming to PlayStation, Switch, and Steam.</p><p>We gave the first game a 7.75 out of 10, with reviewer Marcus Stewart criticizing its lackluster gameplay but praising its "gorgeous presentation." Here's hoping that the sequel brings more variation to the table.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>However, the teaser trailer doesn't feature a release date or year, and it features a watermark that says it is "early development content," suggesting this remake could be quite a ways away from launch.
