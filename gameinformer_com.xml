            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1980620454323740736">announced</a> a second Kirby Air Riders Direct, and it's happening this week. More specifically, the "Kirby Air Riders Direct 2," as Nintendo calls it, will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 23, and feature roughly 60 minutes of information about the game. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/19/nintendo-details-kirby-air-riders-and-its-november-release-date">Like the first one that aired in August</a>, Kirby Air Riders director Masahiro Sakurai will host the presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>During the last direct, we learned more about the game's roster, which includes Kirby, Meta Knight, Waddle Dee, King Deedeedee, and many more, the second button players can use in the game, two gameplay modes, and the November 20 release date. As for what to expect during this second direct, it's anybody's guess. Of course, there's still plenty to learn about the game but considering the August direct lasted 45 minutes, we've already learned so much about Kirby Air Riders. Nonetheless, we'll be tuning in this Thursday.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/oJVsNMp_nAU?si=ueniAhK4JHBUVINx" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to learn about Kirby Air Riders during this Direct?
