Hurst is probably best known for his role as Opie Winston in the FX series <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, and he most recently appeared in the Netflix series <em>The Abandons</em> last year. However, Hurst also provided the voice of Thor in 2022’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness">God of War Ragnarök</a>, a performance that earned him a BAFTA nomination. In those games, Kratos was portrayed by Christopher Judge.&nbsp;</p>
