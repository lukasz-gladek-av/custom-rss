In addition to being the theatrical premiere date of <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em>, the third film in the franchise, a new story expansion hits 2023’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora the same day.</p><p>The similarly named From the Ashes expansion – the game's third story DLC since launch – stars a Na’vi warrior named So’lek in a story set shortly after the conclusion of the main campaign. So’lek hails from the Trr’ong clan, and after being ambushed and left for dead by the RDA and its allies, the rival Ash clan, he awakens to find his world in ruin and his family scattered.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUWvehEu6vY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUWvehEu6vY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>To seek revenge and find his family, So’lek journeys across Kinglor Forest (which has seen better days) and a brand-new area within the Western Frontier. From the Ashes can be purchased standalone for an unknown price for existing owners of the game, and it will be included as part of the new From the Ashes edition of the game that includes the base campaign and the Floating Mountains bonus content.</p><p>"With 'From the Ashes', we wanted to push the boundaries of what players can experience in Pandora," said Omar Bouali, creative director at Massive Entertainment. "This expansion delivers a darker, more personal story, enhanced immersion via third-person gameplay, and intense new combat mechanics that deepen the emotional and tactical stakes. We wanted to offer fans a thrilling new perspective on the Western Frontier, with deeper storytelling and more visceral gameplay."</p><p>From the Ashes will arrive shortly after a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/21/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-third-person-mode-new-game-plus-in-december">free December 5 update</a> that will add a third-person mode and New Game Plus to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.
