            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Larian Studios has released Hoxfix 34 for Baldur's Gate 3, and it brings with it a native Steam Deck build of the game. The team says this build should feature better framerate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>Before today's hotfix, Baldur's Gate 3 ran decently on Steam Deck via a Proton build, but it came with some noticeable drawbacks, like a sometimes-unstable framerate and fuzzy resolution. Though we haven't tested it ourselves, it sounds like Larian's new native Steam Deck build will be the best way to play Baldur's Gate 3 on the go moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpAGlgJMYLc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpAGlgJMYLc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This is not just good news for Steam Deck users either," the hotfix notes read." The work the team has put into this build also means that everyone will get to enjoy overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3."</p><p>Elsewhere in the notes, Larian has addressed various questions players might have about their saves and other aspects of transitioning to this new native build. Head <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278">here</a> for more on that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Koijima Productions' Beyond the Strand presentation revealed a few new details for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away">Physint</a>, the studio’s in-development action espionage title. Although studio head Hideo Kojima said earlier this year that the project was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away">at least five years away from release</a>, he unveiled a piece of key art along with some of its celebrity voice talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima reiterates that Physint, which was first revealed during a January 2024 State of Play, is in the conceptual stages. However, he says the game’s technology will be more advanced than Kojima Productions' upcoming horror game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>. While we don’t see any in-game footage, Kojima revealed a Physint poster showing off the game’s protagonist.</p>

<p>While Kojima has not yet cast the main character, he does reveal three film actors playing unknown supporting roles: Charlee Fraser (<em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Anyone But You</em>), Ma Dong-seok AKA Don Lee (<em>Train to Busan, Eternals</em>), and Minami Hamabe (<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>). Kojima then shared images of Hamabe rendered in-engine, showing off the technology's impressive realism.&nbsp;</p><p>Physint has no release window, but it will be coming to PlayStation platforms (likely Sony's next-generation console).
