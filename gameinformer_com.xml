            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been so anticipated for so many years that it's become a meme, crowding the chat of every major game showcase of the last seven years. While we've had recent glimpses, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d70c00a-ace5-4c4a-a1c2-b92d36666a68" data-entity-substitution="canonical">like the announcement that it was coming to Switch 2</a>, we haven't heard a concrete update from Team Cherry since&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">its announcement that it wouldn't be releasing in 2023</a>. This week, that will finally change.</p><p>Team Cherry's official YouTube channel has a premiere set for Thursday, August 21, at 10:30 AM ET/ 7:30 AM PT. Its title reads, "Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement," while the caption simply reads, "The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!" It is unclear what exactly this announcement will involve, but fans are mostly just hoping for a release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Despite the general lack of information, Silksong is playable at this year's Gamescom,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/#:~:text=Play%20Hollow%20Knight%3A%20Silksong%20with%20a%20new%20demo%20%E2%80%93%20on%20PC%20or%20ROG%20Xbox%20Ally%20X">according to Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/microsoft-partners-with-asus-for-dedicated-handheld-xbox-device">it will be available on Microsoft's ROG ALLY device</a>, so we're expecting some kind of announcement during Opening Night Live in a few hours. Geoff Keighley seemed to support this by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">posting a photo with a clown nose</a>, potentially referencing the meme of Hollow Knight's protagonist in clown attire that's posted whenever we don't get news about its sequel.&nbsp;</p><p>However, partnered with this announcement is a series of Bluesky posts from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who is known for accurately digging up information from behind the scenes of the games industry. Not only does he claim to have "the story behind why Silksong took seven years to make," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr5gpfhkk2x">citing a video call he did with Team Cherry's founders earlier this month</a>, he also says, "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4xi2x5c2g">No, Silksong's release date will not be announced</a> today at Gamescom Opening Night Live, despite Geoff Keighley's teasing." Team Cherry's Thursday announcement will come after Opening Night Live, however, so there's a chance we might get a date then. While Schreier has a solid track record in this line of work, none of this is confirmed, so take it all with a grain of salt.</p><p>Regardless of when it drops or what this trailer will bring, people will be there to watch it. With 15,000 in the YouTube audience a full 47 hours before it even happens, it's safe to say this is one of the most anticipated games of the decade. Here's hoping Team Cherry gives them something to get excited about.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/19/hollow-knight-silksong-special-announcement-set-for-august-21]]></content:encoded>
