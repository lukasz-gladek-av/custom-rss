Gameplay of the Switch 2 version (which does not look as sharp as its PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC counterparts) was shown during the presentation.</p><p>Until today, Cronos: The New Dawn has only had a 2025 release window. The September 5 release date is so far only officially confirmed for Switch 2, but it's safe to presume that is also the release date for the other platforms, as well, but at the the time of publication, Bloober has not made that clear.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-coming-to-switch-2-in-september]]></content:encoded>
