            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Tides of Annihilation raised a lot of eyebrows when it debuted during a PlayStation State of Play in February, and the promising dark fantasy action game got another showing today, this time on the Xbox side during its Partner Preview. Curious fans were treated to a four-minute gameplay trailer showing off a titanic boss fight that, frankly, looks awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>The adventure draws inspiration from Arthurian legend (as in the lore of King Arthur) and centers on an otherworldly invasion of a modernized London. This invasion has fractured the world into distorted mirror realities, and it’s up to protagonist Gwendolyn to travel between two worlds, London and the mythical Avalon, to save her family, the city, and existence itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s trailer shows off an impressively flashy boss battle against Tyronoe, one of the eight sisters of Morgan le Fay. The video, which developer Eclipse Glow Games confirms is captured in-engine, shows how Gwendolyn will enlist the aid of legendary knights, of which there are 10 in total, to augment her abilities and turn the tide (pun intended) of battle. Today's trailer shows her tag-teaming with former rival Sir Lamorak.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Tides of Annihilation is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but it does not have a release window.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/new-gameplay-trailer-for-arthurian-action-game-tides-of]]></content:encoded>

<p>He begins discussing remakes by mentioning platform limitations of the past.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were confined by a lot of elements when we developed those games," Horii tells me. "So seeing this new generation of creators [<strong>Editor's Note: </strong>Horii is seated beside Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa during this interview], reimagining and remaking these titles, it is an interesting sight to see.</p><p>"One of the key differences between video games and other entertainment platforms or media – you can always revisit those old mangas, old movies, but for video games, it's getting more difficult to play older games. So to actually offer an opportunity for players around the world to actually play the older titles in a new way in this modern day and age and on the current generation of consoles and platforms, I think it's a really great thing."&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>video editor Alex Van Aken, who accompanied me on this Reimagined trip, followed up with Horii to ask about his thoughts on game preservation. He says it's a difficult topic.&nbsp;</p><p>"In a lot of ways, it's really something that can't be helped in this day and age," Horii says. "Back then, kids had limited forms of entertainment, or limited accessibility to entertainment. So they would spend tens and hundreds of hours in video games, but nowadays, it's a little bit different. The way people or kids interact and engage with video games is very different from when they did way back then, a few decades ago, since it's not just video games; there are so many different types and forms of entertainment. It's really hard to have a video game take [a piece of that] pie. So yeah, it's a difficult topic."</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for its release, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/20/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-on-remakes-and-game-preservation]]></content:encoded>
