            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Longtime Tekken director and series producer Katsuhiro Harada has revealed he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada, whose credits include not only Tekken but the SoulCalibur series, Pokkén Tournament, and more, said he wanted to reach the Tekken series' 30th Anniversary, which happened last December, as a major career milestone and is ready to move on.&nbsp;</p><p>He says he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of the year, but has been asked by the publisher to appear at the Tekken World Tour Finals at the end of January, and he will be attending as a guest. Alongside this news, Harada has released <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">"TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada's Final Mix" on SoundCloud,</a> as he has always wanted to perform as a DJ at a tournament but never had the chance.&nbsp;</p><p>"So instead, I will be releasing – for the first and last time – a 60-minute Tekken DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement," Harada writes in his announcement <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?s=20">post</a> on X. "Listening to it brings back many memories. Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In Harada's announcement post, he talks about his love of arcade fighting games, his journey with Tekken and game development, and how he sought the advice of longtime mentor Ken Kutaragi, former CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, commonly referred to as "The Father of PlayStation," and "received invaluable encouragement and guidance," noting that "his words quietely supported me in making this decision."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alongside news of Harada's departure, the Tekken X account released a </strong><a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20"><strong>statement</strong></a><strong> that says the following regarding Harada's upcoming leave:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the Tekken series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the Tekken series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the Tekken community at the 'Tekken World Tour 2025 Global Finals' Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The statement also includes words regarding the future of the Tekken series, and they read as follows:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8. We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide. We express our deepest gratitude for Harada-san for providing us with vision and continued success over the years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On that note, Harada mentions in his announcement that, "Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day," so it sounds like the Tekken series is in good hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Harada's Tekken journey goes all the way back to the beginning, where he was a voice actor for Marshall Law, Yoshimitsu, and Kunimitsu in the first Tekken. In Tekken 2, he voiced Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu once more. With Tekken 3 in 1997, not only did Harada voice Yoshimitsu and newcomer Forest Law, but he also directed the game. Since then, he's been a creative lead on the series through 2024's Tekken 8.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tekken-8/aggressively-absurd">read <em>Game Informer's </em>Tekken 8 review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do you have any favorite Harada memories?
