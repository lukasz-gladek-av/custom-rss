            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo and Lego have become regular collaborators in recent years. Between its Lego Mario line of toys and more recent models like an NES or Bowser, the Nintendo-specific Lego sets are plentiful enough that they take up huge sections of the aisle in toy stores. Today, the two announced their latest collaboration: a replica of Nintendo's first handheld, the Game Boy.</p><p>The set is aimed towards nostalgic adults, coming with an 18+ age recommendation. It doesn't light up, and it's (perhaps obviously) not a playable system, but the buttons are designed to be pressed, with a realistic tactile feel. The model comes with two game cartridges – Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening – which can be inserted just as you would into the real handheld. It also comes with swappable screens to simulate each game, along with a third option showing the Nintendo logo.</p><p>Take a look for yourself at the photo gallery below.</p><p>The Lego set will retail for $59.99 in the United States. It launches October 1 of this year, but you can preorder one at regular Lego retailers (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=ignlego-20&amp;ascsubtag=070hgOr7WJvqG6SJWg1FAAQ">Amazon</a>) starting today.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/a-lego-game-boy-replica-comes-out-this-october]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft has revealed the launch date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows' first story expansion. It also detailed other significant updates coming as part of the summer stretch of its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-year-1-roadmap-includes-story-expansion-parkour-improvements-new">Year 1 content roadmap</a>.</p><p>Claws of the Awaji, the game’s first big story DLC, is launching on September 16. Set after the conclusion of Shadow’s events (meaning you need to beat the game to unlock it), it centers on Naoe tackling a fresh slate of foes on the new island setting of Awaji. The expansion is touted to feature over 10 hours of content and will be free to players who pre-ordered Shadows. It is unclear how much Claws of Awaji will cost to purchase standalone.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pIOSHHyhm4?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>New Game Plus arrives in an update next week on July 29. The mode resets story and objective board progression, but allows players to retain their character level, gear, skill points, knowledge rank, and Hideout progression in a fresh campaign. When starting New Game Plus, players have the option of restarting the story from the very beginning or skipping the prologue and starting when Naoe first acquires the Hideout.</p><p>In terms of progression, the July update also raises the level cap from 60 to 80. New Knowledge Ranks, Mastery, and Knowledge Skill ranks will also be introduced. The Hideout will receive new upgrades, including those for Heiji’s Forge. July 29 will also add Project 3, adding new resources, data files, and exclusive Animus-themed rewards.</p>
