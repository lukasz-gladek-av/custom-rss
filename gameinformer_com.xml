            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>EA Sports is teasing the announcement of a new college basketball game. This would mark the publisher’s first return to the the college side of the sport since 2009.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660">cryptic tweet</a>, the publisher posts a photo of an EA Sports-branded basketball (posted above) along with the message “Bring the Madness. Let’s run it back.” This would, of course, be a reference to March Madness, the NCAA's yearly college basketball tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>NCAA March Madness was also the name of EA's defunct college basketball series, which was released annually from 1997 to 2009 and rebranded in 2008 to simply NCAA Basketball. The franchise was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/02/10/ea-sports-confirms-ncaa-basketball-benching.aspx">discontinued in 2010</a> in the wake of then-pending <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/12/17/former-college-athlete-suing-ea-and-ncaa-over-likeness.aspx">lawsuits</a> surrounding the use of collegiate players’ likenesses in video games.</p><p>EA did not share any additional information, but it announced the resurrections of its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/02/ea-sports-announces-return-of-college-football-games">College Football</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/29/electronic-arts-takes-another-swing-at-golf-with-ea-sports-pga-tour">PGA Tour</a> franchises in a similarly succinct fashion, so expect a follow-up sooner rather than later. What do you want to see in a new College Basketball game? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/30/ea-sports-teases-a-new-college-basketball-game]]></content:encoded>
