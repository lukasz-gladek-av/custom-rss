            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most beloved characters in video games, and the success of his recent trilogy of live-action movies has only further proved that fact. As the franchise has continued, each movie has introduced more characters from Sonic's lore, with a post-credits scene in the latest movie announcing the arrival of Amy Rose. While she's silent in that scene, today, we learned actress Kristen Bell will be portraying her in the upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4, </em>according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.</p><p>Bell is known for her starring roles in <em>The Good Place, Veronica Mars, </em>and the <em>Frozen </em>movies, though video game fans might also remember her performance as Lucy in the first three Assassin's Creed games. She's performed alongside Sonic's voice actor, Ben Schwartz, many times, with both on the main cast for all five seasons of <em>House of Lies</em>.</p>

      <p>Amy Rose in Sonic Dream Team</p>
  
</article>

<p>Amy is one of Sonic's most commonly appearing sidekicks, being featured in just about every modern iteration of the series and being playable in a few, as well. She's loud, passionate, wields a disproportionately massive hammer, and is often depicted as being absolutely in love with Sonic, though he rarely reciprocates. Personality-wise, she's got a lot in common with Miss Piggy and Harley Quinn. We recently encountered her as the Lady of the Lake <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUawaRsbij0">in our Super Replay of Sonic and the Black Knight</a>, but she's featured in good games too.</p><p>Given that this is the first we've heard of Bell's involvement, it will probably be a few months until we see our first trailer. In any case, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 hits theaters in March 19, 2027. Interestingly, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/09/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-delayed-by-a-few-weeks" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98b449b2-d68e-4a5a-9ed3-d4722dc3276f" data-entity-substitution="canonical">that's just seven weeks before Nintendo's live-action Zelda movie is slated to come out</a> – it's going to be a big spring for video game adaptations.</p><p><em>[Source: </em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>]</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/18/kristen-bell-will-voice-amy-rose-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-4]]></content:encoded>
