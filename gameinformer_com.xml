            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-gets-graphical-updates-versus-modes-multiple<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Though most Capcom fighting fans are looking ahead to next month's arrival of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="254c61b7-b9ae-4243-b832-89ef551d2039" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/15/revisiting-forgotten-friends">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>, the publisher is showing that it will continue to support its existing compilations. Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrived last September on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC before arriving on Xbox One in February, but that isn't stopping Capcom from improving the library of included games months later.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, players will be able to download a free title update for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. The update will improve specific elements of select games and deliver several overall tweaks and bonuses to the bundle. Most notably, the free title update adds Versus mode to all six of the fighting titles. Additionally, Capcom has provided updated options for how you access the menu to avoid accidentally triggering it mid-match. You'll also be able to reset your current game straight from the pause menu. All of these updates mentioned so far will also be added to Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>

<p>This update also adds new artwork from Capcom artist Shinkiro, plus new Cap-Jam remixed songs. Meanwhile, X-Men vs. Street Fighter now allows players to select from multiple versions to experiment with different balancing and gameplay. Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes receives graphical and resolution enhancements via this free title update. Check out the specifics through the trailer below.</p>

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics gathers seven of Capcom's collaborations with Marvel, including six fighting games and one beat 'em up. The full list includes X-Men Children of the Atom, Marvel Superheroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Superheroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, and The Punisher.</p>

<p>This update to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be available tomorrow, April 16, across all platforms.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/screenshots-of-the-rumored-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-have-leaked.1165458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/15/screenshots-of-the-rumored-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-have-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Screenshots from the unannounced but heavily rumored remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion have leaked online. Apparently, fans unearthed the images by digging through the website of the game’s reported developer, Virtuos Games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The images, which have now been circulated on social media by popular accounts such as <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1912121397867872406">Wario64</a>, various forums like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/?rdt=35724">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/">ResetEra</a>, and have been uploaded to image galleries like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a>, depict several before/after screenshots comparing the original game to its updated visuals. Various pieces of key art, including an image of the game’s Deluxe Edition and its contents, have also surfaced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">IGN</a> </em>noted, Virtuos’ website is currently down at the time of publishing. It’s been heavily reported that the studio is developing the remaster alongside Bethesda’s Dallas and Rockville studios, per <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-screens-and-details-have-leaked/">Video Games Chronicle</a></em>. The game will reportedly feature both visual and gameplay enhancements/changes to the 2006 open-world RPG. Virtuos has generally served as a support studio for numerous titles, having previously worked with Obsidian on The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition and other remasters such as Batman: Return to Arkham.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A remaster of Oblivion has been rumored for some time, dating back to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/19/leaked-microsoft-doc-indicates-xbox-is-working-on-oblivion-remaster-fallout-3">leaked Microsoft documents</a> that surfaced during the company’s 2023 FTC trial (itself three years old when it was leaked), stating the project was in the works. Speculation has ramped up in recent weeks, with reports from various journalists and <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">online leakers</a> claiming inside sources pointed at an April launch for the game and that it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC alongside Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was already quite a bit of smoke to this fire, and today’s leaks would all but confirm the Oblivion remaster’s existence. Bethesda and Virtuos have not responded to the situation at the time of publishing. We’ve contacted Bethesda and Xbox for comment and will update this story with a response should we receive one.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dune: Awakening has been delayed. The upcoming MMO based on the popular sci-fi universe was originally scheduled to arrive on May 20.</p>

<p>Developer Funcom explains the delay will allow the team to address feedback provided by players following the Persistent Closed Beta. As such, the game will now launch on June 10, with a head start beginning on June 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Dune: Awakening is a beast of a game,” says Funcom in a statement. “This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we’re making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funcom also explains that the delay allows them to host a large-scale beta weekend next month that will host even more players. The team plans to share more information about this beta soon.</p>

<p>You can read Funcom’s complete statement&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1912144059843379626">posted to X</a> below (click the image to enlarge).&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Dune: Awakening was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/dune-is-getting-an-open-world-mmo">first revealed</a> during Gamescom 2022 and is an open-world survival-focused MMO. The game takes place in an alternate timeline to the recent films as players must work together to survive Arrakis by crafting resources, architecture, and locating water. Despite its multiplayer nature, Funcom promises to deliver a cinematic storyline with Dune’s lore permeating the experience through server-wide politics and intrigue. The game allows for multiple approaches to getting ahead, whether amassing political power, controlling the Spice trade, or simply acting as a scouter to map out the world and sell that information to players. You can learn more by reading our extended preview from last year <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/03/04/spicing-things-up">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dune: Awakening will be available for PC via Steam on June 10, with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions planned to launch sometime afterward.&nbsp;</p>
