Developer Team Lazerbeam describes the game as a first-person roguelike double-deckbuilder. Players must work through mysterious fungi-filled dungeons that combine hand-drawn 2D art and animations with 3D exploration.</p><p>The reveal trailer shows how the game’s mechanics work, including why Shroom and Gloom is a “double deck-builder.” The first deck players build is one for exploration, with different cards serving as tools to help advance through dungeons. Then, when it’s time to fight, players use a separate combat deck to take down fungal enemies.</p><p><strong>Check out the double-deck action in the trailer below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Shroom and Gloom allows players to collect new cards and upgrade and modify them “infinitely,” suggesting a lot of customization for players’ decks. After defeating these mushroom foes, you can season, skewer, roast, and ultimately eat them to restore health.</p><p>Team Lazerbeam says its dream version of Shroom and Gloom features “hundreds of cards, deep meta-progression and scores of unique enemies, spread across a dense network of caves and tunnels.” It also says the game is in an early stage of development, but it encourages players to check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271280/Shroom_and_Gloom/">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more about Shroom and Gloom, check out this fresh batch of screenshots below:&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Due out soon on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690030/The_Last_Gas_Station/">Steam</a>, The Last Gas Station falls somewhere between cozy and spooky; service other woodland creatures still driving a gas vehicle during the day, but mysterious things happen to anyone who runs a pump at night.</p><p>As the new owner of this abandoned gas station, you’re tasked with stocking shelves, managing customers' fuel levels, serving snacks, and upgrading your operations to keep things running smoothly. It’s also up to you to solve the mystery behind the previous owner’s disappearance.</p><p><strong>Check out the screenshots for a look at the game below:</strong></p><p>“[Always] keep an eye on the shadows,” a press release reads. “This place has secrets, and not all of them want to stay buried.”</p><p>Alongside running the gas station, players can design custom neon signs, decorate the inside of the store, and ultimately, bring this cozy, tucked-away gas station back to life. While managing the gas station is the main objective of The Last Gas Station, Alawar also describes the game as a “bite-sized, story-driven sim where cozy vibes meet mysterious undertones.”</p><p>“It’s a game about forgotten places, creeping dread, and the effort it takes to keep something – anything – going in a world that’s already moved on,” the press release says.</p><p>There is no release date for The Last Gas Station, but Alawar says it’s coming to PC soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
