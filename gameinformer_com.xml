<p>We spent a day at The Chinese Room's studio in Brighton, England, and had the opportunity to tour the workspace, interview developers, and, of course, go hands-on with Bloodlines 2. Our cover story dives deep into the character options, the game's history, and our impressions of the combat in an open-world Seattle. We played as all four of the game's playable clans, and we'll go in-depth on how skill progression works. Of course, all of this coverage is wrapped in the context of Bloodlines 2's troubled development timeline, which we shed some light on for the uninitiated. As always, it's only the tip of the iceberg, and you'll be able to see the rest of our exclusive coverage all month long at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/Bloodlines2">GameInformer.com/Bloodlines2</a>.</p><p>The rest of the issue is jam-packed with content as well. Editor-in-chief Matt Miller traveled to Wizards of the Coast's headquarters to learn about two upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons books about the Forgotten Realms, a setting you'll find familiar if you played Baldur's Gate 3. Marcus Stewart spoke to Giant Squid's Matt Nava about Sword of the Sea and got exclusive details about a new area in the game. And Wesley LeBlanc dug deep into Grounded 2, the upcoming survival sequel from Obsidian, to learn everything he could about the game prior to its Game Preview launch next week.</p>
