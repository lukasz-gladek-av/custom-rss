<p>"Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community," a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement received by <em>Bloomberg</em>. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship."</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>writes that the spokesperson also said the closure was due to "a recent business review." The most recent news out of the studio was that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">it was working on a live-service game in the God of War universe</a>, but that it was canceled before ever being revealed publicly.</p><p>The news is shocking, largely due to Bluepoint's high-quality track record. The studio was founded in 2006, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/30/welcoming-bluepoint-games-to-the-playstation-studios-family/">but wasn't acquired by PlayStation until 2021</a>. Demon's Souls, the studio's most recent project, is a remake of the game of the same name that launched alongside the PS5. We gave it a 9.25 at the time, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/demons-souls-ps5/demons-souls-review-hello-dark-souls-my-old-friend">calling it a "delightful treat."</a> Bluepoint also assisted in the development of God of War Ragnarök, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness">which we gave a 9.5</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/goty-2022/2022/12/23/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2022">lauded as our second favorite game of 2022</a>.</p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em><strong>Bloomberg</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/19/playstation-shuts-down-bluepoint-games-makers-of-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus]]></content:encoded>
