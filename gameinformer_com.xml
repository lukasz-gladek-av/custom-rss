No, it’s not a release date, but it is confirmation that the game is, in fact, still happening.</p><p>A new <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166?s=46&amp;t=NQuiqRa_BGRV8b-BEm-aYw">post</a> from the official Prince of Persia X account frankly states,&nbsp;</p><p>“Yep, we’re still deep in the game — exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us."&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the post shares a new piece of artwork (posted in the header above).&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s a rare update for the troubled title, which was first announced in September 2020. The remake of the 2003 classic was originally in development at Ubisoft’s Indian studios in Mumbai and Pune with a planned launch in early 2021. The game was initially billed as a ground-up remake with improved textures and lighting, modernized combat, new cinematics, and re-recorded dialogue from the original voice actors (including Prince actor Yuri Lowenthal).</p><p>A few months after its reveal, the game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/08/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-by-two-months">delayed a few months</a>, then <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/05/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely">postponed indefinitely</a>. In 2022, development was transferred to Ubisoft Montreal, the studio behind the original Sands of Time, which effectively reset its development. During Ubisoft Forward in 2024, the publisher announced a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ubisoft-forward/2024/06/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-coming-in-2026">2026 launch window</a> for the remake, and it’s unclear what the new scope of its improvements will be.</p><p>When it was announced, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake was slated to launch on last-gen consoles and PC. It's unclear if the game will still launch on those platforms, as one would imagine development would shift to current hardware.
