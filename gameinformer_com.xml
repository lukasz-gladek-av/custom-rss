At the time, Nintendo shared pre-orders would be happening the following week, but it had to pause those plans in the face of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">Trump's ambiguous tariff plans</a>. After some time, however, Nintendo made public that pre-orders would begin today, April 24, and that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-demand-outpaces-nintendos-expectations-and-supply">demand was already exceeding supply</a>.</p>

<p>Which lead to last night, at 12 p.m. ET, when pre-orders at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy officially opened. Many of us here on staff were at the ready, credit cards in hands, to secure our consoles. Some of us were successful. Some of us were not, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lnknfbsobs2f">some of us fell asleep</a>.</p>

<p>But what about you? Were you able to pre-order a Switch 2? Did you not even bother trying? Are you perfectly happy with your Steam Deck and have no plans to get a Switch 2? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

Raiders of Blackveil is said to combine elements from MOBAs, RPGs, and PvE extraction titles to deliver a strategic action game that can be played solo or cooperatively with up to two friends.</p>

<p>In Raiders of Blackveil, you fight through a dystopian future in which a mega-corporation, Blackveil, oppresses the industrial-fantasy world's animals. Players join the animal rebellion working to take down the company and preserve a future free from enslavement and mindless consumerism.</p>

</article><p>The Copenhagen-based studio has been developing Raiders of Blackveil in secret for the past two years with developers who have worked on series like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and Kane &amp; Lynch on the team.&nbsp;Flösser, who is CEO of Wombo Games, served as chief creative officer at Square Enix during development of games like Hitman's first season, Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, Deux Ex: Human Revolution, and Thief. He also worked on Hitman: Absolution, Hitman: Blood Money, Freedom Fighters, and more in managerial roles.</p>

<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finaly be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,"&nbsp;Flösser said in a press release. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in Early Access later this year."</p>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is scheduled to launch into Early Access this coming summer.</p>
