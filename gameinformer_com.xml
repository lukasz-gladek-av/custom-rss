The news caps off an incredible run for SGA, as he was not only a key part of the 2024-2025 NBA championship-winning Thunder but also league MVP, Finals MVP, and scoring champion.</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander joined the NBA in 2018, when he was drafted 11th overall by the Charlotte Hornets. He was traded that same day to the Los Angeles Clippers, where he played for one year and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In July 2019, Gilgeous-Alexander was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he has played since. Since that trade, SGA has been named to three All-Star Teams and three All-NBA First Teams. The Toronto-born star also took home the 2023 Lionel Conacher Award, given to Canada’s male athlete of the year.</p>
