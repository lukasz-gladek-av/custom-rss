            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Supermassive Games’ next Dark Pictures Anthology game, Directive 8020, has a new launch date after being <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/22/supermassive-games-delays-directive-8020-to-2026-amid-studio-layoffs">previously delayed out of 2025</a>. You can look for the new sci-fi horror adventure on May 12.</p><p>Directive 8020 is Supermassive’s first sci-fi story and centers on the stranded crew of a crashed colony ship on planet Tau Ceti f. The game stars the ship’s pilot, Briana Young, played by actress Lashana Lynch (<em>Bob Marley: One Love</em>, <em>The Woman King</em>), who must decide who among her team to trust as an alien organism capable of perfectly mimicking any crewmate infiltrates the ship. A new trailer shows off the game's action and drama.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61OMILUgVyo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Like previous Supermassive titles such as The Quarry and Until Dawn, Directive 8020 is a cinematic, choice-driven adventure where your decisions steer the plot in various directions and can affect who survives and who perishes. However, Directive 8020 is a more active experience, with players using stealth to sneak around enemies in fully explorable environments. Directive 8020 can be played solo or with friends in five-player couch co-op. Online multiplayer will arrive as a free update post-launch.</p><p>Directive 8020 also has a new feature called Turning Points, which allows players to rewind and revisit key decisions. This makes it easier to keep favorite characters alive should they perish, view different outcomes without replaying the entire game, and collect missed achievements. Those looking for a more hardcore experience can play Survivor Mode, which presents the story with pure permadeath and no re-dos.</p><p>Directive 8020 was originally scheduled to launch on October 2, 2025, but was delayed due to layoffs at Supermassive. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on May 12.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/10/directive-8020-the-next-dark-pictures-game-gets-may-launch-date-and-new-trailer]]></content:encoded>
