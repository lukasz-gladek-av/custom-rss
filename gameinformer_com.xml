And now there's news on the Tomb Raider front – we got our first look at Sophie Turner's portrayal of Lara Croft. See it for yourself below.</p>

<p>It's a relatively classic take on the character, as opposed to the recent reboots (known as the survivor trilogy). Turner wears shorts, pistol holsters on each hip, a teal tank top, and even Lara Croft's sunglasses (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9yxzDDvAm8&amp;pp=ygUdZ2FtZSBpbmZvcm1lciB0b21iIHJhaWRlciBuZ3Q%3D">which appear on the cover of Tomb Raider III</a>), complete with red, circular lenses. As is often the case with live-action adaptations, Turner's initial casting as the character was met with skepticism from some, but now that she's in the wardrobe, you can't deny she looks the part. We'll just have to wait and see if her performance holds up as well.</p><p>The Tomb Raider series is created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (known for <em>Fleabag </em>and <em>Solo</em>), who serves as both showrunner and writer. The show's cast also includes Martin Bobb-Semple, Sigourney Weaver, and Jason Issacs (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2023/2023/06/08/baldurs-gate-3-gets-lucius-malfoy-actor-as-a-bad-guy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f702c8e0-a49a-4402-b9f0-e4d417704f26" data-entity-substitution="canonical">who <em>Game Informer</em> readers might know as Gortash in Baldur's Gate 3</a>). The show is currently in production.</p><p>This shift back towards the classic Lara Croft look is a move the entire brand is making in 2026, which is the 30th anniversary of the first game's launch. This year, we can expect to see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-a-remake-of-the-first-game-in-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22919195-3e7d-45ff-9ee7-9d0fc3924b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, a reboot of the original game</a>, while 2027 will bring <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-takes-lara-croft-to-northern-india-in-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="00d416d9-e569-40af-805a-22822aae745c" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tomb Raider: Catalyst, a wholly new adventure</a>.
