The plot follows protagonist Velvet Crowe, who seeks to avenge her brother's murder alongside a crew of sea-faring pirates. &nbsp;The remaster's quality-of-life improvements include the ability to toggle encounters, destination icons, and earlier access to the Grade Shop. The game also includes all of its released DLC packs. Check it out in action in the trailer below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LrgChQAkLCA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LrgChQAkLCA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In our review of the original Tales of Berseria, former <em>Game Informer </em>editor Kimberly Wallace scored the game a 7.5 out of 10, writing that "Tales of Berseria does some interesting things, and is the most captivating Tales storyline in some time. I like the majority of its ideas, but the execution often feels half-realized. It still feels like the franchise isn't making big enough leaps, and is just content to bring its fans more of the same. By now, you probably know if you're okay with that. Nothing ever made me stop playing, but the flaws are impossible to ignore. "</p><p>Berseria is the latest of Bandai Namco’s ongoing Tales of Series - Remastered Project, its renewed initiative to release improved versions of older Tales games for modern consoles as part of the franchise’s 30th anniversary. Thus far, it has released two remasters in 2025 with January’s Tales of Graces f Remastered and October’s Tales of Xillia Remastered.</p><p>Tales of Berseria Remastered will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/19/tales-of-berseria-remastered-is-coming-in-february]]></content:encoded>
