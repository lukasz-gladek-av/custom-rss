            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is the latest game to grace <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">the cover of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and you can read all about that here. If you're familiar with the history of this specific Dragon Quest entry, then you likely already know Reimagined is the second time Square Enix has remade Dragon Quest VII.&nbsp;</p><p>It released the original Dragon Quest VII in 2000 on PlayStation in Japan and a year later as Dragon Warrior VII in the U.S. Square Enix remade it for the Nintendo 3DS, launching Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past in 2013 in Japan before releasing it in the West in 2016. Now, Square Enix is remaking it a second time, with Reimagined launching next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>It's rare to see a single entry get this many remakes, so we've created two galleries to show you the differences between the original Dragon Quest VII, the 3DS remake, and Reimagined, using the same spot across the years.&nbsp;</p><h2>Gallery 1: Original vs. 3DS Remake vs. Reimagined</h2><h2>Gallery 2: Original vs. 3DS Remake vs. Reimagined</h2><p>As you can see, the differences are pretty stark due to hardware limitations and varying visual styles and aesthetics. We're excited for Reimagined, though, and you can read about why in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait"><em>Game Informer </em>cover story here</a>, and if you aren't already a subscriber, be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Which visual style for Dragon Quest VII do you like best?
