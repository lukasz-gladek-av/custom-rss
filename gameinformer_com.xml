            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, we announced that our first issue of this new era for <em>Game Informer </em>magazine will <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover">feature Borderlands 4 on the cover</a>. Now, we can excitedly show you the actual cover art, share the contents of this jam-packed issue, and let you know that if you're a subscriber, you can <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/borderlands4">read everything in the magazine starting today through our website</a>! And, if you're not subscribed yet, you can still <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/subscribe">take advantage of early-bird pricing</a>!</p><p>We spent two days embedded in Gearbox's headquarters in Frisco, Texas, playing exclusive content and talking to many folks behind the highly anticipated looter-shooter. We were the first to get our hands on all four Vault Hunters in the Borderlands 4 base game. We were also the first to explore the Carcadia Burn region, participate in various side activities throughout Gearbox's seamless world, and get a guided tour of Dominion, the Timekeeper's walled city. Within the pages of the cover story, you'll learn exclusive details from our hands-on sessions with the game, as well as our interviews with several members of the leadership and development teams at the studio. And those details will go even more in-depth as our month of coverage rolls out at <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/borderlands4">GameInformer.com/Borderlands4</a>.</p>

<p>But this issue is so much more than just that 12-page cover story. Within the pages of this issue of <em>Game Informer</em>, you'll also find Kyle Hilliard's hardware review of Nintendo Switch 2, Charles Harte's report from Summer Game Fest 2025, and Marcus Stewart's reflections on the Donkey Kong Country area of Super Nintendo World. In addition, I did a deep dive into Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and interviewed several professional skateboarders about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/honoring-two-of-the-most-critically-acclaimed-games-ever" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="11674bee-efb9-4aa2-998d-abf67c077cf4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>'s impact. We also have an excellent piece on the creation of the titular alien in Alien: Isolation from contributor Sab Astley, as well as an interview with Sonic the Hedgehog's original designer, Naoto Ohshima, from contributor James Mielke.&nbsp;</p><p>That's on top of our standard preview suite, which includes recent coverage of games like Grand Theft Auto 6, Resident Evil Requiem, Ninja Gaiden 4, 007 First Light, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, The Outer Worlds 2, and much more! And of course, you can expect the latest reviews of games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Mario Kart World, Elden Ring: Nightreign, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>At the final, all-virtual E3 in 2021, Koch Media <a href="https://gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/10/koch-media-shows-off-gungrave-gore-painkiller-and-slate-of-new-ips">announced</a> a reboot of the 2004 shooter Painkiller was in development. Today, we learned players will make their return trip to Purgatory on October 9.&nbsp;</p><p>While the original Painkiller was created by Outriders/Bulletstorm developer People Can Fly, this modern reimagining â€“ simply titled Painkiller â€“ is made by Anshar Studios and published by 3D Realms. Despite the change in creators, the new game shares thematic similarities with its predecessor. Players are trapped in Purgatory and must fight their way out to prevent the fallen angel, Azazel, from invading Earth. Instead of controlling a single protagonist, however, the first-person shooter lets players select from four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch, each with distinct traits.&nbsp;</p><p>Painkiller can be played alone, but it also features three-player online co-op. In addition to blasting apart demons with a variety of supernaturally-enhanced firearms (both classic and new), you can upgrade abilities using tarot cards.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-a4ywaWme2M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Painkiller will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 9. A Standard Edition of the game costs $39.99, and pre-ordering it earns you the Iron Crusade skin pack for characters and weapons. A Deluxe Edition runs for $49.99 and includes the skin pack plus three post-launch DLCs that will include additional character/weapon skins.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/the-painkiller-reboot-gets-an-october-launch-date]]></content:encoded>
