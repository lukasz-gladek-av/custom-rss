It brings missions, hero classes, new tools and weapons, and much more to the brick-building adventures within Fortnite.&nbsp;</p><p>Players will enroll in the newly founded Supernova Academy to unlock their super-powered potential, master new powers, and obtain additional skills to defeat evil in the form of Mask Maker Daigo, who is dead set on destroying the world. The Supernova Academy will be your base of operations and hosts other heroes playing at the same time as you. Utilizing founder Vengeance Jones and hero-turned-mentor Hope, you can explore and interact with academy staff to learn more about Expeditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Daigo's Spires have appeared throughout the world. In co-op missions, you and up to three other heroes will explore the map, aid citizens, and take down enemies in wave-based combat. Search for chests to find additional resources, currency, and new gear. Throughout Expeditions, you'll have three distinct hero classes to check out: Shadow Caller, The Hunter, and Rift Ripper. Check them out and more in the Fortnite LEGO: Expeditions trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Shadow Caller utilizes her flying ability and the dark shadows to summon projectiles that deal explosive damage but heal allies. They can also transform into a flock of invulnerable ravens, too. The Hunter can deal massive damage to a single target and utilize their grappler to close the gap between them and an unsuspecting enemy. Finally, the Rift Ripper launches Rift Shards and Rift Crystals to take out enemies all over the arena, and the presence of crystals will enhance their abilities in a big way.&nbsp;</p><p>Tools in Expeditions are divided between weapons and gadgets, and new weapons include Dual Daggers, the War Hammer, and Plasma Pistols. You'll need these weapons and more to take down Spires, Light Demon Guards, Heavy Demon Guards, Kor, one of Daigo's lieutenants, and Titans, rare but formidable foes.&nbsp;</p><p>For another look at Expeditions, check out the screenshots below:&nbsp;</p><p>Fortnite LEGO: Expeditions launches tomorrow, June 18.
