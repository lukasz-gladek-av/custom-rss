            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>South Korean video game publisher Krafton, Inc. has announced that PUBG: Blindspot, the free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter developed by PUBG Studios, is now available on Steam via Early Access. The team describes the game as being "designed around fast, high-intensity indoor firefights" that mix close-quarters battles and team-based strategies with a top-down perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Krafton, which made headlines last October after touting that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">it would transform into an "AI-first company,"</a> says in a press release that today's Early Access launch marks the beginning of an open development phase, "with the development team actively working alongside players to refine gameplay systems and expand content" ahead of the game's 1.0 release. PUBG Studios adds that player feedback will play a central role in shaping the game with updates designed around depth, balance, and quality.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Maps</h3><p>PUBG: Blindspot is the first spinoff of the mega-popular battle royale grandfather (though that's a heavily debated topic), PUBG, and takes place decades after the events of the original game. The head of the IP, Taesok Jang, says, "Starting with PUBG: Blindspot, the PUBG IP will continue to expand into new genres and platforms."&nbsp;</p><p>Today's launch precedes Competitive Season 1, which will launch next week on February 12. You can download the game right now on Steam, or play the game via Nvidia GeForce Now streaming.&nbsp;</p><h3>PUBG: Blindspot Characters</h3><p>If you've played any of the game's betas, you'll find some new content in today's Early Access release, like a defense-exclusive character with Molotov-based arena control, according to the press release.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out PUBG: Blindspot?
