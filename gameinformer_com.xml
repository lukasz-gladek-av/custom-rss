That's just the start of what we played and saw. In addition to that day at 2K's Novato, California offices, we spent two full days inside Gearbox's Frisco, Texas headquarters, exploring new areas, trying out all four of the base game's Vault Hunters, and picking the brains of tons of folks behind the Borderlands franchise.</p><p>The image you see above is not our cover, but you won't have to wait long to see the art and read the story. We will reveal our cover art on Tuesday, June 24, before launching the issue digitally later that day. That also means that anyone who has subscribed to the print edition of <em>Game Informer </em>will receive their first issue in the coming weeks.

Sitting at a computer terminal, gameplay involves solving puzzles styled as complex command prompts to navigate directories, run software, and execute commands. &nbsp;You'll also use an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) to communicate with fellow hackers and gain intel on your target. A press release provides a more ominous overview of what s.p.l.i.t. entails:</p><p>“A daunting task lies ahead. Unconscionable secrets and vulnerabilities lie buried deep below legacy code and engineering. Only with meticulous planning and unwavering composure will they be unearthed.”</p><p>s.p.l.i.t. launches on July 24 for PC via Steam, Windows, and Linux. Meanwhile, Buckshot Roulette is slated to come to Xbox consoles sometime this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
