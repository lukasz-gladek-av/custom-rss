Developer Spiders announced today that its follow-up will launch on March 12.</p><p>Set three years before the original GreedFall, The Dying World is a choice-driven action RPG where players control a native of the island of Teer Fradee, the primary setting of the last game. The protagonist is a guardian of knowledge and nature; unfortunately, this status attracts the attention of colonists from the old continent of Gacane, which is being ravaged by the Malichor plague. The invaders capture the player and bring them to Gacane to be experimented on, so players must find a way to escape and return home. Along the way, they’ll get roped up in a grander conspiracy that may endanger everyone on Teer Fradee.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dialogue choices steer the game’s plot, as players can talk their way in and out of situations as well as build alliances, including assembling a party of companions. When diplomacy isn’t an option, you can cut down threats in the tactical battles. You can pause the action to carefully coordinate actions with companions or focus on your player while allies act independently.</p><p>GreedFall: The Dying World is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 12.
