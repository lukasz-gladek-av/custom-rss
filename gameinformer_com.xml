            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/everything-announced-at-the-july-nintendo-partner-direct">Last week's Partner Direct</a> was a chance for Nintendo to reveal some of the upcoming lineup of third-party games coming to Switch and Switch 2, and this week, that trend continues. This Thursday, August 7, is the air date of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw?si=Go2B9DbjQ6TjkrJB">a new Indie World Showcase</a> showcasing games coming to Nintendo platforms from smaller developers. You'll be able to watch it with the link below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The stream begins bright and early at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run for 15 minutes. While we don't know exactly which games will be revealed during the stream, the description on the video says it will include "announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." Notable games we hope to hear more about include <a href="https://gameinformer.com/hades2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b435a0ab-2d81-45ef-aec6-d16f9dedb4ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Hades 2</a>, which should be leaving early access soon, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, a game so highly anticipated it's become a meme. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/#:~:text=Play%20Hollow%20Knight%3A%20Silksong%20with%20a%20new%20demo%20%E2%80%93%20on%20PC%20or%20ROG%20Xbox%20Ally%20X.">It should be playable at Gamescom</a>, however, so it's a little less unreasonable than usual to expect an appearance.</p><p>For everything announced at last week's Partner Direct, including <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-coming-this-december">Octopath Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-coming-to-all-platforms-including-switch">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/everything-announced-at-the-july-nintendo-partner-direct">check out our round-up</a>. If you've seen some of the recent news and hope to get a Switch 1 of your own, bad news: <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-rising-but-not-switch-2">it recently went up in price</a>.</p><hr><p><em>What games do you hope to see at the Indie World Showcase? Let us know in the comments!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/05/nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-thursday-august-7]]></content:encoded>
