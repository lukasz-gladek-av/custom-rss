            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The digital version of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine Issue 373, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">featuring Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on the cover</a>, is now live! Subscribers can read the full issue right <a href="https://gameinformer.com/DragonQuestVII">here</a>, with print issues arriving in mailboxes starting in December. If you <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe to <em>Game Informer</em></a><em> </em>before November 25, you'll receive this latest issue highlighting <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> across 12 pages in our cover story. And, because this is somehow the first-ever time a Dragon Quest game has appeared on a <em>Game Informer </em>cover, we have an 8-page deep dive into the history of the Dragon Quest series, as told by the man who created it, Yuji Horii.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to that historical retrospective and a 12-page Dragon Quest Reimagined cover story, which features my thoughts after playing the game for two hours alongside words from the game's various development leads, this issue is jam-packed with excellent features. Senior Associate Editor Marcus Stewart spoke with Edmund McMillan, the creator of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, about his new game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>. Freelancer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imluisgutierrez.bsky.social">Luis Joshua Gutierrez</a> plugged a hole in <em>Game Informer </em>coverage with an awesome look at the culture surrounding the mega-phenomenon that is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/05/17/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-december-2025-premiere-date">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>. The entire GI crew banded together to create a round-up of the best co-op games to play during the holidays!&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of holidays, Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller scoured storefronts to bring you 10 pages of great gifts for the gamers in your life. Elsewhere in this exciting issue, we have a look at the history of games that <em>Game Informer </em>has awarded the prestigious 10/10 review score (because this issue features a review for a game we gave a 10!), the top five dragon quests, a look at Riot's upcoming League of Legends card game, Riftbound, a look back at 2025 aka The Year of the Ninja, and even a post-launch <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> interview with Sucker Punch Prodcutions.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you haven't seen it yet, here's another look at the beautiful and vibrant Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover, which features Prince Keifer, Hero, and Maribel avoiding the gaze of a stone golem in the game's unique visual style, which is based on real-life dolls Square Enix created:&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher NetEase is planning to shut down <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/02/former-world-of-warcraft-league-of-legends-lead-greg-street-reveals-new-studio-and">Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>, a studio it founded in 2023 and led by Greg Street, formerly of Blizzard and Riot Games. The studio was developing a triple-A MMORPG codenamed Ghost.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/another-netease-games-studio-is-shutting-down/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>, Street announced the impending closure on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391147465636397057/">LinkedIn</a> yesterday. He states Fantastic Pixel Castle (FPC) will be shuttered on November 17, unless it's able to secure funding to continue working on its MMO project independently.&nbsp;</p><p>“Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17," reads Street's statement. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains. While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVX2OfQ8LV0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVX2OfQ8LV0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This news comes a few weeks after Fantastic Pixel Castle announced it was parting ways with NetEase. A <a href="https://www.fantasticpixelcastle.com/new-detail/?id=806">community blog post</a> published today on the studio's website expresses cautious optimism for securing last-minute funding, saying "we still believe Ghost has a fighting chance."</p><p>"We are still 100% focused on finding new funding to make our game," reads the blog post. "Even if the state of the industry feels fairly dire we’re encouraged by the conversations we’ve been having and fortunate that we have a great playable demo already! So there is still some hope to be had - hold onto that hope because now we’re going to get kinda real."</p><p>Fantastic Pixel Castle is the latest casualty of the China-based NetEase's gradual shift away from funding international studios. This change in strategy has forced partnered developers such as the Vancouver-based <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/another-former-mass-effect-leads-studio-is-facing-funding-issues-as-worlds-untold-pauses-operations/">Worlds Untold</a>, the Austin-based <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mmo-veteran-rich-vogel-confirms-netease-has-shut-down-his-studio-t-minus-zero/">T-Minus Zero</a>, and the Seattle-based <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a> to either close or pause development in a scramble to secure new funding.</p>

<p>Though it never had a formal reveal, Fantastic Pixel Castle’s “Ghost” project was planned to be a fantasy MMORPG. Despite its genre, FPC’s website states Ghost would “avoid the tropes of fantasy that you've already seen hundreds of times,” and was centered on a setting called the Shardlands, with players alternating between realms known as Blue and Red Shards.</p><p>These functioned as player servers, with Blue Shards designed for private play with friends while Red Shards offered a more traditional, massively multiplayer experience. Ghost would feature a chapter-based narrative, character classes, &nbsp;and a more streamlined approach to make playing with friends easy, regardless of their character level and progress.</p><p>For more on NetEase, check out the June reveal of the publisher's first triple-A single-player title, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/20/netease-reveals-its-first-triple-a-single-player-game-blood-message-and-it-looks-awesome">Blood Message</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/04/fantastic-pixel-castle-a-studio-founded-by-former-world-of-warcraft-lead-faces-closure]]></content:encoded>
