            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 stirred up controversy among fans for its DLC strategy, particularly in how it was locking away two of the game’s six vampire clans as launch-day DLC. Publisher Paradox Interactive and developer The Chinese Room have walked this back; the Lasombra and Toreador clans will be part of the base game at release.</p><p>Originally, the Lasombra and Toreador clans were going to be offered as DLC for $21.99 and as part of the $89.99 Premium Edition. Since this extra content would be available at launch, many fans, who were already upset that the sequel features significantly fewer clans than the 2004 original, became outraged by the presumption that content was being removed from Bloodlines 2 to be sold at an additional cost. While Paradox initially explained the move as purely a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-two-clans-locked-behind-dlc-because-of-business">business decision</a>, the backlash led to the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-want-to-do-this-right-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-issues-playstation-store-pre-order-refunds-as-publisher-works-to-make-big-changes-before-launch">issuing refunds</a> for those who pre-ordered the game on the PlayStation Store while promising significant changes would be made before Bloodlines 2's launch.&nbsp;</p><p>A new overview trailer running down the game’s base and post-launch content revealed the DLC adjustment includes a message in the video description by Bloodlines 2 executive producer and White Wolf executive vice president, Marco Behrmann. He addresses the DLC controversy by stating,</p><p>"Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing," said Behrmann. "We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>With this update, here’s how Bloodlines 2’s various editions and post-launch content schedules are now as follows:</p><p><strong>Digital Editions</strong><br>Bloodlines 2 Deluxe Edition: Base game + Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack<br>Bloodlines 2 Premium Edition: Base game + Expansion Pass (Santa Monica Memories, Loose Cannon, The Flower &amp; The Flame)</p><p><strong>Physical Editions</strong><br>Day One Edition - Base game + Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox bonus.
