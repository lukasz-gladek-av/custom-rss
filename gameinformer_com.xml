            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Though MachineGames is likely basking in the great reception to last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, as well as its Order of Giants DLC that launched last week, the studio is still thinking about BJ Blazkowicz and Wolfenstein. In a recently released <a href="https://youtu.be/E189QG28rnE?si=4-b6qJ9glHHbjGnv">Noclip documentary</a> about MachineGames, studio co-founder Jerk Gustafsson said the team sees BJ's story as a trilogy and hopes that it isn't done with Wolfenstein yet, as reported <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-have-a-story-to-tell-machinegames-says-wolfenstein-is-a-trilogy-that-isnt-yet-finished/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think this is important to say because we have always seen this as a trilogy," Gustafsson says when describing BJ's journey from resistance fighter to family man. He later says, "...at least I hope that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like we can expect a third Wolfenstein game, if MachineGames has any say over the matter.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E189QG28rnE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The last mainline Wolfenstein game was 2017's The New Colossus, although the team also helped develop 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/wolfenstein-youngblood/making-the-best-of-change" target="_blank">Youngblood</a>, a co-op-focused spinoff set 19 years after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/wolfenstein-the-new-order">The New Order</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">The New Colossus</a>. It's been eight years since the last mainline entry, and more than six years since MachineGames released any game related to Wolfenstein, so here's hoping the team is cooking something up now post-Indy.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/wolfenstein_the_new_order/b/xboxone/archive/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review.aspx">Wolfenstein: The New Order review</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/wolfenstein_ii_the_new_colossus/b/playstation4/archive/2017/10/26/a-bloody-and-unforgettable-revolution.aspx">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus review</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/wolfenstein-youngblood/making-the-best-of-change">Wolfenstein: Youngblood review</a>.
