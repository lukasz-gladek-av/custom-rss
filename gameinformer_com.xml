</article>

<p>For video game fans, Tagawa was best known for portraying Shang Tsung in the first live-action Mortal Kombat film. His performance as the villainous sorcerer, which featured now-famous lines like "Your soul is mine!" and "It has begun!", became so beloved that he would reprise the role in various adaptations, such as the 2013 web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy.</em> Tagawa also appeared as Shang Tsung, voice and likeness, in Mortal Kombat 11’s Aftermath story expansion and the mobile action RPG Mortal Kombat: Onslaught.</p><p>Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1996807767474995239">shared his condolences on X</a>, writing,</p><p>We lost a legend today.&nbsp;</p><p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa&nbsp;played Shang Tsung in the 1995 Mortal Kombat film and sadly passed away at age 75. We had the privilege of his portrayal on the first MK film but also as an amazing voice actor in the Mortal Kombat 11 game.</p><p>Cary was one of a kind.

Tagawa had voice credits in other video games: World of Warcraft: Legion, Batman: Rise of Sun Tzu, and Soldier Boyz.&nbsp;</p><p>As reported by<em> Deadline</em>, Tagawa's family confirmed he died Thursday, surrounded by his children.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/obituary/2025/12/05/mortal-kombat-actor-cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-passes-away-at-75]]></content:encoded>
