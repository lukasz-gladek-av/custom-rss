Characters Yunobo, Tulin, Riju, and Sidon from the game are all getting Amiibos on June 5.</span></span></p>



<p><span><span>Nintendo also promised but has not yet shown, a Mineru's Construct Amiibo for the future. Presumably, the Mineru's Construct Amiibo will be a little like Breath of the Wild’s Guardian Amiibo, which was oversized and a little different.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Though it didn’t overtly say as much, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 will be Amiibo compatible. </span></span><a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the"><span><span><span><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> is getting a Switch 2 release and with it will also come alongside a collection of Amiibo and Amiibo cards.</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2.1153602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The long-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 Direct aired today, and it was jam-packed with announcements, including hardware specs, new Mario Kart, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/new-sakurai-directed-kirby-air-riders-announced">Kirby</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">Donkey Kong</a> games, and a long list of third-party titles coming to the console. The one thing it didn't detail, however, is the pre-order process, which is a little convoluted.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="56edb9ce-2e0e-4efe-b723-cffc17c36b65" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Pre-orders at participating retailers will go live next Wednesday, April 9. At the time of publishing, retailers have yet to prepare their individual pre-order pages (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?id=pcmcat1742407305710#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20notifications%20about%20the%20new%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%2C%20games%20and%20more">though Best Buy has a link to sign up for updates</a>), but they will likely be updated within the next few days. That said, based on how recent console launches have gone, it will likely be a fairly frantic process with scalpers attempting to buy up stock to resell at a higher price. Once we learn specific launch times, you'll want to be right on the webpage the moment it goes live to maximize your chances.</p>

<p>To avoid that scramble, you can try to grab your console directly from Nintendo, but there's more to that process than meets the eye. If you head to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">Nintendo's website</a>, you'll be able to sign up to indicate interest in purchasing a system once they're available. To be clear, this is not a pre-order, but a sign-up list to indicate who might want to pre-order, so there's no payment information required. You will, however, need an active Nintendo account – more on that below. Once you sign in, you can choose between a base system for $449.99 USD or a bundle including a digital version of Mario Kart World for $499.99 USD.</p>

</article><p>The timeline here is different, however. Invitations from Nintendo won't arrive until a month or so after, on Thursday, May 8. They'll also come in waves, with additional invites sent out to eligible accounts until the store is open to the general public. Invitations will also only go to account holders that meet the following "priority criteria":</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The account must be the one that purchased a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">That Online Membership must have been active for a minimum of 12 months.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">You must have opted to share gameplay data and played at least 50 hours of games.</li>
</ul><p>If your account fits all three of those criteria, you'll be able to order a console to be shipped to your address – no Nintendo Store pickups are allowed. The link will be active for 72 hours, so it will be less intense than the mad dash on other sites. It also specifies that launch day delivery is not guaranteed and that purchases will be limited to one system per account, though you can also buy accessories for the system.</p>

<p>As wheelchair-bound basketball players, movement involves dragging the Joy-Cons simultaneously to push yourself forward, simulating the movement of pushing a wheelchair. Flicking the controller performs shots, and players can even roll up skateboard-style half-pipes to perform fancy trick dunks. The game’s challenge comes in intuitively using both Joy-Cons at the same time to steer the characters and take it to the hoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below.</p>

The upcoming multiplayer game will be exclusive to Switch 2.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer follows From Software’s standard of using out-of-context clips, showcasing various characters such as a swordswoman wielding a ringblade and a rocket-powered flying robot. Scenes of a gothic castle complex and cathedral interiors create an oppressive atmosphere, and things take a turn for the bonkers with clips of a guy biting someone’s neck and draining them of a dark substance. A character is also seen transforming into a T-Rex-like monster. From Software describes The Duskbloods as a PvPvE experience, meaning players will face off against other human-controlled characters in addition to in-game enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>What does it all mean? The vague narration stating that “the moontears will flow for one and one alone” doesn’t illuminate much. However, a developer diary with game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will air on April 4 and should, hopefully, explain more. But until then, color us fascinated given From Software’s stellar track record.</p>

<p>The Duskbloods is coming to Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/new-sakurai-directed-kirby-air-riders-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Amid a number of other new game announcements today, Nintendo showed off a first look at Kirby Air Riders, the new game from acclaimed director Masahiro Sakurai. Sakurai is the originator of both the Kirby franchise and Smash Bros., so his involvement with the new Air Riders is exciting news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details are scarce on the new game, but footage revealed Kirby flying along on a star beside three of his other-colored Kirby friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Kirby Air Ride released on GameCube over 20 years ago. It was a racing game with simplified controls and high-speed course navigation, which also highlighted Kirby’s ability to suck up enemies and absorb their abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, while some games from today’s Nintendo Direct were highlighted as launch games, Kirby Air Riders features no date of launch on Switch 2.</p>
