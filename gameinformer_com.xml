            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is an anime-inspired "arcade-flawless" rhythm game that was set to launch tomorrow, on November 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. However, developer D-Cell Games has delayed Unbeatable to next month, just hours before the game's launch, citing a progression-blocking bug that it says must be fixed before release.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unbeatable was supposed to come out tomorrow," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/598542531394797771?l=english">announcement</a> on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> reads. "That's a scary sentence. Here's a worse one: Unbeatable will now release on December 9. I hate that I have to say this. There's no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I'm <em>personally </em>sorry about this and wish it was different."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/ASRfsN8-okg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASRfsN8-okg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The delay announcement features a QA and in the "Why would you only tell me now?" section, D-Cell responds, "Because the decision was only made a few hours ago (No, really, I'm writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the very last-minute delay, D-Cell says, "QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that's serious enough it's considered unreleasable," and that "fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and <em>not </em>fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We're fixing it."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the game is being delayed more than a month to December 9, it is due to other games launching over the next month. D-Cell says the team had a pretty good spot on November 6, "where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a <em>lot </em>to find another island, and [December 9] is the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us some breathing room we didn't have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow."&nbsp;</p><p>Unbeatable will now launch on December 9 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-releases-in-november">check out the Unbeatable reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/05/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-delayed-to-december-hours-before-its-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/suiting-back-up">Dispatch</a>, the episodic superhero narrative adventure, has been a critical success since the launch of its first two episodes on October 22. This positive word of mouth seems to be working, as developer AdHoc Studios has announced it has sold over 1 million copies of Dispatch within its first 10 days of launch.</p><p>The game, which stars <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Aaron Paul as a down-on-his-luck former superhero working as a dispatcher for reformed supervillains, is created by former Telltale Games writers and sports a similar choice-driven narrative-focused format. Dispatch is an eight-episode adventure, with Episodes 5 and 6 dropping today (and every Wednesday). We still have to wait until next week’s finale to see how AdHoc sticks the landing, but Dispatch has garnered near-unanimous praise for its writing, story, character development, and performances from actors such as Laura Bailey, Jeffery Wright, and Erin Yvette, to famous content creators including Jacksepticeye, Joel Haver, and MoistCr1TiKaL. Its impressive sales numbers complement an overwhelmingly positive 93% critical rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dispatch/">Metacritic</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“It’s always a little strange when the numbers get so big you have to talk about them,” says Michael Choung, AdHoc Studio's CEO and executive producer, in a press release. “A week ago, we were just as thrilled watching Let's Plays and reaction videos. But milestones like this matter. They mean AdHoc will be able to make more story-driven episodic originals, and we hope it means it'll be easier for other devs to do the same. Hard to believe we’re only halfway done.”</p><p>Dispatch is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC for $29.99.
