Studio co-founder Graham Smith claims that the newly announced Blighted is the team’s “largest and most ambitious game to date.”</p><p>Revealed for the first time during today’s Summer Game Fest presentation, Blighted is an isometric action/RPG that calls to mind games like Hades at first glance, but the developers actually cite Metroidvania games as a core direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Playable either solo or cooperatively, the game focuses on a lone survivor who must retrieve the lost memories of his destroyed village after a being named Sorcisto has consumed them. Blighted features a focus on precise and fast-moving combat built around combos and finishers, and your own Blight acts as a dynamic difficulty scaler that changes enemies, your own character, and the surrounding world.&nbsp;</p><p>Blighted is being scored by Jim Guthrie, whose prior work includes titles like Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, Below, and Nobody Saves the World.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on both the concept and the pedigree of the studio, this feels like a title worth watching closely.&nbsp;</p><p>Blighted doesn’t yet have a release date, but the developer shared that we can expect it to arrive on Steam.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGU-7zvoNfU&amp;ab_channel=DrinkboxStudios" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGU-7zvoNfU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Neil Patrick Harris is stepping into the leading role, and based on the banter from this reveal, he’s got a strong handle on the irreverent tone of the sometimes-hero.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a surprise to see a VR title for such a high-profile Marvel superhero franchise, but the involvement of developer Twisted Pixel gives good reason to be hopeful. Through titles like ‘Splosion Man and Comic Jumper, the team established solid cred for doing goofy humor, and that same team has done work on VR in its more recent releases.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the initial trailer, Deadpool VR appears to feature a thematically appropriate mix of weird characters, extreme violence, and idiotic humor. The gameplay shown appears to be first-person shooting and other actions, such as driving and traversal.&nbsp;</p><p>Deadpool VR is targeting a release later this year, and you’ll only be able to play on Meta Quest 3 and 3S.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jof1MtYccs&amp;ab_channel=MetaQuest">age-restricted full trailer on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The film came out years ago, and the comic has also been complete for some time, but the recent Netflix anime has shown that there is still an appetite for Scott and pals' adventures.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fY3RgEkSfNk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fY3RgEkSfNk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When it was shown on stage at the Summer Game Fest presentation, Geoff Keighley stopped short of calling it a sequel, but a new pixelated Scott Pilgrim beat 'em up is coming soon. Scott Pilgrim EX features music from Anamanaguchi (the creators of the soundtrack for the Scott Pilgrim vs. The World video game), and has a story by Scott Pilgrim's creator, Bryan Lee O'Malley. Confirmed playable characters are Scott and Ramona, but there will be five mysterious others. The game will also feature four-player co-op.</p><p>The game is being developed by Tribute Games, the team behind the upcoming Marvel: Cosmic Invasion and the critically acclaimed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
