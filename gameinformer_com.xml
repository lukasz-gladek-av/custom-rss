At the time, it said the games would get an update to increase resolution and frame rates on Switch. We later learned players can expect the games to run at 4K/60 FPS, and now, thanks to a new video uploaded on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/future-nintendo-and-switch-2-news-will-arrive-via-new-nintendo-today-app">the Nintendo Today news app</a>, we can see it in action.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Though we can’t embed the video here – it’s locked into the Nintendo Today! App – Wario64 on Bluesky posted a recording of the video that you can check out <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lqn4deix3u2a">here</a>.</p><p>As you can see, it’s quite transformative to see Pokémon Scarlet and Violet running at 60 FPS, especially if you’re familiar with how they run on Switch. The Switch 2 update has seemingly taken these games, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/12/01/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-patch-arrives-with-bug-fixes-nintendo-apologizes-for-games">which often dip well below 30 FPS in busier areas of Paldea</a>, and given them the power to run at a seemingly stable 60 FPS. Despite the higher frame rate, the games still largely look the same, as you can’t rework an art style with increased resolution and 60 FPS gameplay.</p><p>Still, if you haven’t yet journeyed through Paldea, Switch 2 looks to be the best place to explore this region.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches this week, on Thursday, June 5.
