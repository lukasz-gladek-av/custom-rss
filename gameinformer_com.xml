            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Resident Evil Requiem will follow a new heroine, Grace Ashcroft, but that last name should ring a bell for any fans of the Outbreak series. In a new trailer shown during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 today, we get to see a little bit of Grace's backstory and history with her mom, Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft.</p><p>Alyssa is a field reporter and playable character from the Outbreak series, now playing a major role in Resident Evil Requiem. She's the mother of Requiem's lead, Grace Ashcroft, and looks to be on the run from some dangerous foes. After a mysterious phone call and a power outage, we get a brief look at a playable section where the player, as Grace, follows Alyssa through the darkened and foreboding hotel hallways.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Spare a thought for the world's most doomed hotel manager, as a terrible fate befalls him, and the pair escape. Seeing the dynamics between mother and daughter here seems to emphasize this as a thematic thread for the main game, but we'll have to wait and see for more.</p><p>The wait's not that long, though, as Capcom confirmed <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/resident-evil-requiem-is-arriving-february-2026">Resident Evil Requiem's release date during this year's Summer Game Fest</a> back in June. The next mainline entry arrives on February 27, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. For more on it, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">check out our preview from SGF 2025</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/alyssa-ashcroft-returns-in-new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Game Science managed a rare feat in 2024 – introducing a new action game to the market to significant commercial and critical success with Black Myth: Wukong. It’s clear the studio isn’t resting on its laurels, as the final game shown at this year’s Opening Night Live show aims to continue the story. Black Myth: Zhong Kui is the new entry in the burgeoning franchise.</p><p>The debut trailer certainly doesn’t reveal much. We see two down-on-their-luck men who appear to be on the run, but they quiet down as they realize someone is outside who may be chasing them down. The visuals pan over to a figure riding a massive tiger, revealed to be Zhong Kui.</p><p>In following up on the trailer, Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley offered up that the game follows the “ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth.” The game appears to be early in development (not unexpected given that the last installment only released a year ago), but the game will be a single-player action/RPG rooted in Chinese mythology.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZ7VLcO06Ak"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZ7VLcO06Ak" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/black-myth-zhong-kui-announced]]></content:encoded>

So much so that they'll be crossing over into each other's upcoming titles: Sonic Racing CrossWorlds and Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijHUBZj50fE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijHUBZj50fE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds, a game already crossover-heavy with guest characters like Hatsune Miku, Like A Dragon's Ichiban Kasuga, and even SpongeBob SquarePants, will add Pac-Man to the roster via a DLC pack next year. The pack also adds the Pac-Village racing track, which even lets players race on the classic arcade maze.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Pac-Man World Re-Pac 2, the remake of the PS1 sequel, is getting Sonic-themed DLC in 2026 as well. This update sees Pac-Man rocking a Sonic hat to race through Green Hill Zone and other Sonic levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Fittingly, both games launch only a day apart, with Sonic Racing CrossWorlds releasing on September 25 and Pac-Man World Re-Pac 2 arriving on September 26.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/sonic-and-pac-man-crossover-dlc-packs-announced]]></content:encoded>
