Now, just a few years later, and before the team has released its first game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/sony-announces-heist-video-game-fairgames">an online heist shooter named Fairgames</a>, Raymond has exited the company.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> broke the news, revealing PlayStation leadership didn’t give Haven staff a reason for her departure, but notes that it occurred several weeks after an external test of Fairgames. The publication’s sources say some developers at Haven “were concerned about how the game was received and its progress.”</p><p>A lot is riding on Fairgames as part of PlayStation’s push for live-service games. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/09/sony-has-delayed-half-of-its-planned-playstation-live-service-games">Though many have since been delayed or canceled in development</a>, PlayStation is looking for another hit like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a>, but has stumbled with recent releases like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/concord">Concord</a>, which shut down less than two weeks after its launch, and a lukewarm reception to Bungie’s upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marathon">Marathon</a>, which is now in hot water as a result of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">plagiarized art</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios,” a PlayStation spokesperson told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.”</p><p>“[PlayStation is] committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey” with the new studio co-heads, Marie Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski.</p><p>Raymond previously spent a decade at Ubisoft as a producer for the early Assassin's Creed games before joining EA in 2015 as the head of Motive Studios. She left Motive in 2018 to join the now-defunct Google Stadia as head of Stadia Games and Entertainment. Following her stint at Google, Raymond created Haven in 2021. Several Stadia executives followed her there, and it was revealed that same year, Haven was already working on a new PlayStation-exclusive game. Roughly a year later, in 2022, PlayStation acquired Haven, and now, Raymond is moving on to something else.</p><p>For more, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/fairgames">read about Fairgames here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s because Link’s Awakening is already targeting 60 FPS on Switch 1 – it just struggles to hit and maintain that. Presumably, by accessing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-hardware-detailed-120-fps-hdr-and-more">the extra power of the Switch 2</a>, the game will be able to run at its already-in-place 60 FPS.
