            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Rising video game and console prices have frustrated consumers this year, and today, Sony is adding its flagship console to the list of products getting price hikes. In the United States, the PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and PS5 Pro are each increasing in price by $50.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">a blog post</a> from Sony Interactive Entertainment vice president of global marketing, Isabelle Tomatis, the change is due to "a challenging economic environment." This brings the new prices for each device to the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</li></ul><p>As of today, prices remain unchanged in other countries, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">many of them faced price hikes earlier this year</a>. This news comes a few months after Sony said it was considering raising its prices in the US, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/sony-is-considering-price-hikes-to-cover-trumps-tariffs-but-it-might-not-affect-ps5">but it might not affect consoles</a>. That was, obviously, not the case. Other instances of companies increasing prices lately include <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-rising-but-not-switch-2">Nintendo increasing Switch 2 accessory prices</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/01/xbox-console-and-accessory-price-increases-begin-today-80-first-party-games-starting">Xbox raising its console and game prices back in May</a>. Across the board, it's a rough time to be paying for new games and hardware.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox announced its new handheld's release date today, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/xbox-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-x-handheld-release-date-but-not-price-due-to-macro-economic">but won't reveal its price quite yet, citing "macro-economic conditions</a>."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/sony-is-raising-the-price-of-every-playstation-5-model-tomorrow-august-21]]></content:encoded>
