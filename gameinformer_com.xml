            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>This summer, The Outer Worlds 2 was Xbox's big holiday item, getting a dedicated showcase after the rest of the company's lineup of trailers and reveals. To the shock of many, however, The Outer Worlds 2 was priced at a whopping $79.99 in the US, matching Mario Kart World's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">controversial precedent</a>. As of today, Xbox and Obsidian are changing course, and have decided to revert The Outer Worlds 2's price back to the industry standard.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">On social media,</a> Obsidian shared the news in the satirical tone its sci-fi series is known for, complete with an illustration of Moon Man scribbling out the old price to write a new one. The statement reads as follows:</p><p>Dear Galactic Citizens!</p><p>We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing. As an organization devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2. While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can.</p><p>From the Office of the Director of the Earth Directorate</p><p>If you already pre-ordered the game at its higher price, there's still time to get your money back.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">According to a statement from Xbox to <em>Windows Central</em></a>, some retailers will accept refunds today while others will start tomorrow, allowing customers to swap out their old pre-order for a new one at the lower price.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 is set to launch on October 29 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For our hands-on impressions of the game,&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/24/gamifying-the-flaws-of-capitalism">check out our SGF preview from the last issue of our magazine</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/23/obsidian-drops-the-outer-worlds-2-to-6999]]></content:encoded>
