            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warner Bros. Discovery has been shopping around for a new owner the past few months, and this morning, they entered negotiations with a new winner; <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">Netflix won over Paramount and Comcast</a>. The deal, which combines cash and stock, will see the <em>Stranger Things</em> streaming service acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion, while Discovery Global will spin off into a separate, independent company before the acquisition. Warner Bros. owns many major media brands, such as HBO and DC, &nbsp;as well as Warner Bros. Games, a publisher that owns several major game developers. While this part of the deal was previously unclear, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games"><em>Game Developer</em> has confirmed</a> that this division will be acquired by Netflix as well.</p><p>The inclusion of Warner Bros. Games is ignored in the initial press release (the only games mentioned are <em>Squid Game </em>and <em>Game of Thrones</em>), and <em>Game Developer</em> reports that a conference call held this morning only briefly suggested the game publisher would be a part of the deal. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games"><em>Game Developer's</em> Chris Kerr writes</a>, "Warner Bros. Games was briefly referenced during a conference call held this morning, when the Mortal Kombat logo was shown on a 'Business Overview' slide to highlight Warner Bros.' wider game and consumer product exploits—but that blink-and-you'll-miss-it-moment was largely it." In a later call with a representative of Warner Bros. Discovery, however, <em>Game Developer </em>confirmed that the Warner Bros. Games division would be a part of Netflix's deal.</p><p><em>Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, and the Batman: Arkham series are just a few of the game series Netflix will own.</em></p><hr><p>Warner Bros. Games owns several major gaming studios. There's Netherrealm Studios (known for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection/chronicled-kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>), Avalanche (developers of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hogwarts-legacy/a-potion-well-brewed">Hogwarts Legacy</a>), Rocksteady (known for the Arkham series and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/a-new-report-details-how-a-troubled-development-led-to-suicide-squad-kill-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05c73582-6d92-444a-ab3e-0821b01ab35e" data-entity-substitution="canonical">the recent Suicide Squad game</a>), and TT Games (known for the licensed Lego games, like Lego Star Wars and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/27/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-next-arkham-game-youve-been" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6ddac429-cbe0-4568-ba2d-fe81182bcbb7" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Lego Batman</a>). There are also several WB Games studios, most notably WB Montréal, which developed Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights.</p><p>Netflix has attempted to break into the gaming scene in recent years, offering a wide range of mobile games as a part of a Netflix subscription, including apps like Cut the Rope, indie hits like Dead Cells, and even Rockstar ports like Red Dead Redemption and GTA: San Andreas. Netflix has also acquired several game studios, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc5bdf17-9d59-46dd-adfb-21cbbf2eafb8" data-entity-substitution="canonical">like Oxenfree developer Night School Studios</a>. Netflix is currently <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-partners-with-netflix-for-game-adaptation-of-a-major">collaborating with Life is Strange creators Don't Nod</a> on a mysterious game adaptation of a "major IP". Still, it's unclear how far these efforts have gotten them, and adding major console developers to its portfolio could make a huge difference.</p><p>It will likely be a while before we see the results of this merger; the transaction process is lengthy and is estimated to last 12-18 months. This also assumes antitrust regulatory bodies don't get involved to slow the process, and with a deal of this size, it would not be surprising. The last deal we covered on this scale was Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which fought a major legal battle but ultimately succeeded. The jury is still out, however, on whether that merger was good for consumers or employees, as Microsoft has since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-of-employees-cancels-perfect-dark-everwild-and-more-xbox" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d624b4b-915a-4605-840e-eca886d645df" data-entity-substitution="canonical">laid off thousands of employees</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/xbox-is-shutting-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee67f007-444c-47ee-ba02-5c106da54e43" data-entity-substitution="canonical">closed several major studios</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/19/xbox-console-prices-will-increase-again-next-month">raised the prices of its consoles</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-getting-an-overhaul-and-a-50-percent-price-increase" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="38410bb2-8067-4828-aaaa-1faa408a2a69" data-entity-substitution="canonical">subscription service</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/05/netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-and-its-games-division-including-netherrealm-rocksteady]]></content:encoded>
