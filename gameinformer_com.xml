While it is designed as a three-player co-op roguelite experience, you can also play Nightreign solo… but it’s really, really hard. Fortunately, From Software is listening to players and releasing a patch next week to make solo expeditions easier.</p><p>The studio announced this patch on the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436889293345246">official Elden Ring X account</a>, stating Patch 1.02 arrives next week and includes several bug fixes and improvements for solo expeditions. As for what to expect, From Software <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471">says</a> the effect, “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat,” which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions, and the amount of runes gained will be increased.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This should make the entire experience easier for solo players, as increased runes will allow them to level up faster. And having the ability to revive once per night boss battle will give players more of a fighting chance in Nightreign’s various fights. From Software says further details about Patch 1.02 will be provided next week.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a> and then check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/tips-tricks/2025/05/29/elden-ring-nightreign-beginner-tips-and-tricks"><em>Game Informer’s</em> beginner tips and tricks for Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.

According to a new <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1928454864767463925">post</a> on X by publisher Bandai Namco, 2 million players jumped into Nightreign on its first day, which is technically today, although the game launched for some yesterday, depending on region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's an impressive feat for any game, but not all that surprising for a spin-off of the uber-popular <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-shipped">surpassed 30 million copies shipped</a> last month. Despite featuring "Elden Ring" in the title, Nightreign differs from its predecessor. Instead of a single-player action-RPG focused on exploration, mystery, and overcoming challenges, Nightreign is a three-player co-op roguelite spin on Elden Ring about min-maxing efficiency in each run.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's a great time, and you can read about why in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer's</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.
