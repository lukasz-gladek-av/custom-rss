The game was set to release some time this year, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/31/take-two-ceo-on-gta-6-release-date-we-want-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-the">with periodic soft assurances from&nbsp;Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick that the game was on track</a>, but that is no longer the case. In a statement on social media, Rockstar games announced the delay and wrote, "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p>



<p>Rockstar's games have historically and consistently received delays following their announcement so while the push is disappointing, it is not unexpected. We still don't know much about the game beyond its, so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">only official trailer</a> (which quickly <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">garnered over 100 million views</a> to set a YouTube record for most views within a 24-hour period) and it never had a locked-in release date beyond 2025 before today.</p>

<p>The game was officially announced in December 2023 and is set in a modern-day Vice City (modeled after Miami and South Florida), it appears to star two protagonists, including the series' first female lead, although Rockstar has not yet officially divulged details on these characters or their relationship.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, though if it does launch on the platform, it will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">likely arrive later</a>.

These prices vary across the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other territories. We’ve included the US price changes in this article and recommend our international readers visit the support page to view the pricing updates for their respective countries.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Additionally, Xbox announces that certain upcoming first-party games will retail at $79.99 beginning this holiday season. This will apply to physical and digital versions. Xbox also confirms that existing releases will not see a price change. These software price adjustments are the first to follow Nintendo’s $80 pricing for its upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">Mario Kart World</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now, there are no confirmed Xbox first-party releases for the holiday season. We’ll likely find out which games will be the first to receive this updated pricing during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-and-the-outer-worlds-2-direct-set-for-june-8">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft comments on why it’s making these changes in the post, saying, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.”</p>

<p>Xbox’s price adjustments are the latest in a series of price increases for hardware and software across the industry due to current economic conditions (caused at least partially by the United States tariffs). Earlier this month, Sony <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">raised prices</a> for the PlayStation 5 console family in Europe and other non-US territories, citing “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.”</p>

<p>Nintendo fans have also felt sticker shock at the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">$449/$499 pricing</a>. Nintendo delayed the US pre-order date for the Switch 2 in response to a round of US tariffs before announcing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">price increases</a> for Switch 2 accessories.&nbsp;</p>
