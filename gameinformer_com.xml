            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Chronoscript: The Endless End is an upcoming Metroid-style 2D action game with a killer aesthetic. Players control an editor trapped inside the pages of a book, and must fight for his life to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>The game comes from developer DeskWorks (makers of the similarly hand-drawn RPG Time: The Legend of Wright), and stars an editor who, after visiting a mysterious manor, becomes bound to the pages of his unfinished, never-ending manuscript. This story has been ongoing for a thousand years and refuses to end; it's up to us to find a way to end this long-running narrative once and for all. Chronoscript's hand-drawn pen art aesthetic looks great, and the gameplay plays with its premise by letting players traverse through pages and even swim through spilled ink to reach new areas.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL2rdn9qPuQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL2rdn9qPuQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Chronoscript: The Endless End is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/battle-through-a-never-ending-story-in-chronoscript-the-endless-end-next]]></content:encoded>

The time-traveling adventure takes players across multiple eras to hunt monsters called Horrors, where players can change the fates of key characters as they slice and dice enemies using the game's unique blood-draining combat system.
