            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/marathon-delayed-indefinitely-from-september-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie has delayed Marathon from its September 23 release date, opting not to give a new launch date as it focuses on improving the game with updates, new features, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>"Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear," a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">post</a> from the Marathon Dev Team at Bungie reads. "We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we've made the decision to delay the September 23rd release."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Bungie continues, stating the recent Alpha test period created an opportunity for the Marathon dev team to calibrate and focus on what will make the game compelling in the survival FPS genre. It will use additional closed testing (including Alpha participants) to deploy gameplay updates and test new features as they come online over the next few months. Those features include "upping the survival game, doubling down on the Marathon universe, [and] adding more social experiences."&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding upping the survival game, Bungie plans to add "more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events, [and] making combat more tense and strategic." For doubling down on the Marathon universe, the developer plans to increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with, and a darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy. And finally, in terms of adding more social experiences, Bungie wants a better player experience for solos and duos, and to add proximity chat, "so social stories can come to life."&nbsp;</p><p>Bungie says players will hear from it this Fall when it can share its progress alongside the game's new release date. This indefinite delay follows news last month after an artist online <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">claimed</a> Bungie had stolen her work and used it in Marathon, which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">Bungie confirmed as an "unauthorized use" of art shortly after</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn the new release date, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay">check out this Marathon gameplay trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do these improvements for Marathon sound like something you want? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/the-next-generation-xbox-consoles-will-be-powered-by-amd-in-multi-year-partnership<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has announced a multi-year partnership with tech giant and graphics card manufacturer AMD. The deal will result in AMD technology powering the next generation of Xbox hardware.</p><p>In a new video, Xbox president Sarah Bond explains that the partnership will see AMD co-engineer silicon for a range of devices, including the next generation of Xbox consoles.</p><p>"Together with AMD, we’re advancing the state of art in gaming silicon to deliver the next generation of graphics innovation to unlock a deeper level of visual quality and immersive gameplay and player experiences enhanced with the power of AI, all while maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games," says Bond.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Bond says this move reinforces Xbox’s mission to build a platform where players can take their games anywhere across multiple devices, such as handheld, PC, and cloud.</p><p>“The next generation of Xbox is coming to life, and this is just the beginning,” says Bond. “We can’t wait to show you what’s next.”</p><p>Of course, the big news here is Microsoft confirming another generation of Xbox consoles is in the works. Many have wondered what the future of Xbox as a console platform would be following the Xbox Series X/S' weaker sales compared to the PlayStation 5 and Switch. Combined with the publisher’s increasing focus on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service and its recent initiative to bring its exclusive franchises to rival platforms, such as Forza and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-makes-its-playstation-debut-this-summer">Gears of War</a>, some have questioned the long-term viability of Xbox as a console ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Xbox’s deal with AMD is the second major partnership announcement this month. During Summer Game Fest, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/microsoft-partners-with-asus-for-dedicated-handheld-xbox-device">revealed a partnership with Asus</a> to produce an Xbox-centric model of the company's ROG Ally handheld systems. We played the ROG Xbox Ally during SGF, and you can read our hands-on impressions <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/hands-on-preview/2025/06/08/you-can-launch-steam-games-from-xbox-allys-native-dashboard">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
