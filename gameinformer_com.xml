The event highlights impressive video game art and concept art from the year's games. You can see a small selection of the choices below. <a href="https://www.gamemakerssketchbook.com/2025-winners/">You can see the full gallery here</a>.</p><p>The collection will be on display at Summer Game Fest: Play Days, from Saturday, June 7 through Monday June 9. Prints of all the art pieces will also be available for purchase until July 7 from <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/collections/game-makers-sketchbook">iam8bit's website</a>. Proceeds from those sales go to charity, which is detailed below directly from the event's press release.</p><p>"All proceeds go to the AIAS Foundation in its mission to advance an inclusive, interactive entertainment community through collaboration, education, and professional development. AIAS programs that directly benefit include Amplifying New Voices, student scholarships, early-career professional scholarships, and mentorships. A portion of the proceeds from the Nimit Malavia collection will also go to Day of the Devs, a non-profit with the mission to celebrate the creativity, diversity and magic of video games by giving emerging or underrepresented talent a platform to connect with players."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
