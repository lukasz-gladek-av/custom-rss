            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Tides of Annihilation raised a lot of eyebrows when it debuted during a PlayStation State of Play in February, and the promising dark fantasy action game got another showing today, this time on the Xbox side during its Partner Preview. Curious fans were treated to a four-minute gameplay trailer showing off a titanic boss fight that, frankly, looks awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>The adventure draws inspiration from Arthurian legend (as in the lore of King Arthur) and centers on an otherworldly invasion of a modernized London. This invasion has fractured the world into distorted mirror realities, and it’s up to protagonist Gwendolyn to travel between two worlds, London and the mythical Avalon, to save her family, the city, and existence itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s trailer shows off an impressively flashy boss battle against Tyronoe, one of the eight sisters of Morgan le Fay. The video, which developer Eclipse Glow Games confirms is captured in-engine, shows how Gwendolyn will enlist the aid of legendary knights, of which there are 10 in total, to augment her abilities and turn the tide (pun intended) of battle. Today's trailer shows her tag-teaming with former rival Sir Lamorak.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGOsH1Gp8SE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Tides of Annihilation is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but it does not have a release window.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/new-gameplay-trailer-for-arthurian-action-game-tides-of]]></content:encoded>
