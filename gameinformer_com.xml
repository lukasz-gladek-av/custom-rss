            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Helldivers is preparing to launch a dropship to a theater near you via an upcoming film adaptation, and it just landed a big-time director. Justin Lin, best known for directing several installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, will helm the project.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, the Helldivers movie comes from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions, with Justin Lin’s Perfect Storm Entertainment helping produce. Lin’s credits include directing most of the installments in the Fast &amp; Furious series, starting with <em>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> (2006) and continuing with <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> (2009), <em>Fast Five</em> (2011), <em>Fast &amp; Furious 6</em> (2013), <em>F9</em> (2021), and <em>Fast X</em> (2023).</p><p>According to <em>THR</em>’s sources, Lin is not a gamer and is leveraging this in his pitch to “find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.” The script for <em>Helldivers</em> is penned by Gary Dauberman, the writer behind the It and Annabelle franchises, as well as <em>The Nun</em>. Dauberman also wrote this year's <em>Until Dawn</em>, so <em>Helldivers</em> will be his second video game adaptation.</p>

      <p>Helldivers 2</p>
  
</article>

<p>Given that Helldivers is essentially a video game version of the cult classic film <em>Starship Troopers</em>, turning it into a movie does feel like the snake eating its tail. Helldivers centers on soldiers hailing from Super Earth, an uber-patriotic managed democracy, who defend the planet in an intergalactic war against alien bugs, as well as killer robots and other threats. The first game was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, and Helldivers 2 arrived on PlayStation 5 in 2024 to widespread acclaim and popularity.</p><p>The Helldivers movie does not have a specific release date or window.
