            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Pocketpair has announced that its hit creature-catching open-world survival game,<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/what-is-palworld-the-new-pokemon-with-guns-survival-game-everyones-playing" target="_blank">&nbsp;Palworld,&nbsp;</a>is finally launching out of Early Access and into version 1.0 in 2026. Palworld has been available in Early Access since January 2024, and centers on catching Pokémon-esque critters called Pals, which you can equip with guns to battle other monsters while aiding players in farming and crafting.&nbsp;</p><p>In a developer update video, Pocketpair promises that a “massive amount of content” is being planned for the 1.0 update. However, the studio also acknowledges it wants to clean up Palworld’s remaining technical bugs before it hits 1.0. &nbsp;</p><p>As such, the studio says the rest of 2025 will be “a little quiet from us” as it focuses on preparing the game for its full launch. Because cleaning up the game will be its primary focus, Pocketpair says its Winter update won’t be as big as last year’s Feybreak Island was, but stresses development will not slow down or scale back when it launches in full.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 1.0 announcement comes amidst an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-sue-palworld-developer-pocketpair">ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo</a>, which began last September. The lawsuit, filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, accuses Pocketpair of infringing on several patent rights.</p><p>Pocketpair publicly shared three specific patents from the lawsuit on its <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">website</a>, revealing they were registered after Palworld’s EA launch and were likely done to target the game specifically. These patents cover systems for capturing characters in a virtual space, an aiming system for deploying capture items, and rideable characters. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company seek payments of 5 million yen (plus late payment damages) each. Pocketpair stated it aimed to “assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p>
