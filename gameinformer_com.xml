Now, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">detailed</a> the extent of these updates for existing Switch 1 games, which are free in contrast to the more substantial <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/metroid-prime-4-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-more-get-enhanced-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 edition upgrades of Switch 1 games</a> like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which will cost $9.99.</p><h3>What to expect in the free Switch 2 updates for the listed Switch 1 games:</h3>

That’s because Link’s Awakening is already targeting 60 FPS on Switch 1 – it just struggles to hit and maintain that. Presumably, by accessing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-hardware-detailed-120-fps-hdr-and-more">the extra power of the Switch 2</a>, the game will be able to run at its already-in-place 60 FPS. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don’t have to wait long because the Switch 2 launches June 5.</p><p>For more about the console, read about how <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/nintendo-has-a-plan-for-continuous-flow-of-switch-2-through-the-holidays">Nintendo has plans for a “continuous flow” of Switch 2 through the holidays</a>, and then check out the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/13/2025-nintendo-switch-2-game-release-schedule">2025 Switch 2 game release schedule</a>.
