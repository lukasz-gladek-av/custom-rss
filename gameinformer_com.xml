            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>CD Projekt and GOG.com co-founder, Michał Kiciński now has full ownership of GOG.com. Kiciński founded CD Projekt alongside his brother Marcin in 1994 and co-founded GOG.com, the classic PC game digital distribution platform, in 2008.</p><p>Michał Kiciński resigned from his position at CD Projekt in 2010, but has remained involved in the company. CD Projekt has maintained ownership over GOG.com since its inception, but it <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">announced today</a> that Michał Kiciński now retains full ownership of GOG.com after acquiring 100% of its shares.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was an amazing journey! Good luck, friends. Can’t wait to see you conquering new heights! <a href="https://t.co/wr0jddtRic">https://t.co/wr0jddtRic</a></p><p>— CD PROJEKT RED (@CDPROJEKTRED) <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/2005676674764116405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><p>In <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">a blog</a> announcing Kiciński's acquisition, CD Projekt joint CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote, “With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move.”</p><p>In the same blog, Michał Kiciński. reiterated the original intention of GOG.com writing, “From the very beginning, GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and I came up with the idea for GOG, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players and ensure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you — forever.”</p><p>How and if this affects GOG.com's user experience and library remains to be seen, but hopefully the core idea – make classic games playable on contemporary machines without DRM restrictions – remains true under this direction.</p><p><em>[Source: </em><a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/"><em>CDProjekt.com</em></a><em>]</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/29/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gogcom]]></content:encoded>
