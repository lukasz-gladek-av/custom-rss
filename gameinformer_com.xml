            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the best perks of owning a Switch 2 is its exclusive <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">GameCube library</a> on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The service launched with three titles, and we’re getting our first new addition in the form of Super Mario Strikers next week.</p><p>Super Mario Strikers originally launched on GameCube in 2005 (making 2025 its 20th anniversary), and is an extreme soccer game starring the cast of the Mushroom Kingdom. The arcade-style sports title sees players executing over-the-top special shots and maneuvers, and features various game modes such as Grudge Match, Cup Battles, and Custom Battles. Like Mario Kart, players can use items such as shells and mushrooms to turn the tide of a match.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's worth noting that Strikers was one of the confirmed "coming soon" titles shown during the GameCube library announcement trailer. Other titles shown that are slated to arrive in the near future (by Switch Online standards) include Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chibi-Robo, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokémon Colosseum.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can play Super Mario Strikers when it arrives on July 3. It joins the already available The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX. You can view the full list of currently available games on the entire Nintendo Switch Online classic games service <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2024/04/24/nintendo-switch-online-every-nes-snes-game-boy-n64-sega-genesis-gba-and-gamecube">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/super-mario-strikers-is-the-next-gamecube-title-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Last night’s Capcom Spotlight kicked off with an extended gameplay breakdown of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/pragmata-capcoms-new-sci-fi-action-game-launches-next-year">Pragmata</a>. The upcoming sci-fi shooter was first announced five years ago, and the walkthrough gives curious players a more in-depth look at the game’s combat and mechanics.</p><p>Although we played Pragmata during Summer Game Fest and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/hands-on-with-capcoms-mysterious-sci-fi-adventure">wrote up our impressions</a>, this presentation lets players witness the action we experienced for the first time. After astronaut Hugh Williams becomes stranded on an AI-controlled moon base following a lunar quake, he must rely on the help of the android Diana to survive a station overrun with hostile robots.</p><p>As a machine, Diana uses her hacking abilities to immobilize and render the armored robotic enemies vulnerable using a real-time hacking minigame. Completing this puzzle exposes vulnerabilities within the machines for Hugh to blow apart using his weapons. You can watch Pragmata's gameplay demonstration during the Capcom Spotlight starting at the 0:39 mark.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Those attending Gamescom this year will get to try the game themselves via a public demo at Capcom’s booth. Everyone else will have to wait until 2026 to see how Pragmata turns out. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/pragmata-gameplay-breakdown-details-its-blend-of-hacking-and-gunplay]]></content:encoded>
