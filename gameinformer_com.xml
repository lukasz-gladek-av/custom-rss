Set during World War II, it shows Captain America crossing paths with an early Black Panther (Azurri, T'Challa's grandfather) to stop the villainous Marvel faction Hydra. While we were excited to play it early next year, we've now learned that won't be the case, as it's been delayed indefinitely.</p><p>The news came <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440">via a post on developer Skydance's social media</a>, which announces that the delay will push the game "beyond early 2026," but doesn't clarify anything more than that. It could come later next year, or be delayed even further. You can read the full message in the image below, or in plain text below that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto is one of the most successful franchises in the history of gaming, so it's only natural that people are eager to see the newest entry. "Eager" is putting it mildly, however, due to the fact that it's been 12 years since the series' last entry and developer Rockstar's most recent game, Red Dead Redemption 2, came out seven years ago. When the game's second trailer dropped, it took the internet by storm, and currently has over 137 million views, but was accompanied by a delay <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">into May 2026</a>. Today we learned it would be delayed even further.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is now launching November 19, 2026, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-06/-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-postponed-again-to-november-2026?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjQ2MzExOSwiZXhwIjoxNzYzMDY3OTE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUJQOEhHUEZIWkIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.FA3l0ccfbLCD2C50Rj8MTDX5EYWL2vfxji9EdDGNObc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, which got a look at publisher Take Two's quarterly earnings report.

You can read it below.</p><p><em>Hi everyone,</em></p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</em></p><p><em>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.</em></p><p><em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support.
