            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Rising video game and console prices have frustrated consumers this year, and today, Sony is adding its flagship console to the list of products getting price hikes. In the United States, the PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and PS5 Pro are each increasing in price by $50.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">a blog post</a> from Sony Interactive Entertainment vice president of global marketing, Isabelle Tomatis, the change is due to "a challenging economic environment." This brings the new prices for each device to the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</li></ul><p>As of today, prices remain unchanged in other countries, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">many of them faced price hikes earlier this year</a>. This news comes a few months after Sony said it was considering raising its prices in the US, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/sony-is-considering-price-hikes-to-cover-trumps-tariffs-but-it-might-not-affect-ps5">but it might not affect consoles</a>. That was, obviously, not the case. Other instances of companies increasing prices lately include <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-rising-but-not-switch-2">Nintendo increasing Switch 2 accessory prices</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/01/xbox-console-and-accessory-price-increases-begin-today-80-first-party-games-starting">Xbox raising its console and game prices back in May</a>. Across the board, it's a rough time to be paying for new games and hardware.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox announced its new handheld's release date today, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/xbox-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-x-handheld-release-date-but-not-price-due-to-macro-economic">but won't reveal its price quite yet, citing "macro-economic conditions</a>."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/sony-is-raising-the-price-of-every-playstation-5-model-tomorrow-august-21]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We're officially in the Gamescom cycle, which means a steady stream of previews,&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/we-played-the-first-level-of-hollow-knight-silksong-heres-what-we-think">like our hands-on impressions of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and news tidbits. Xbox provided the latter today, announcing that its upcoming handheld line, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X, will hit store shelves on October 16, just two months from now.</p><p>However, while the release date is clear, we don't yet know how much either product will cost.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-still-cant-say-how-much-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-will-cost-due-to-macro-economic-conditions-despite-announcing-release-date-and-availability-details">In a roundtable interview with IGN</a>, Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen said, "I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macro-economic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October." Because the prices aren't yet live, neither are pre-orders.</p>

<p>The handheld is made in partnership with Asus, a company that has been producing the ROG Ally handheld for a few years now. The cheaper models currently retail for around $500 USD, so it's likely that a partnership between Asus and Xbox would go for around that amount or higher.</p><p>Xbox's release date announcement also detailed some of the handheld's new features, including a handheld compatibility program, which helps to indicate which games are best suited for handheld play, similar to the Steam Deck's verification program. On Xbox, games will either be "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible," with the latter requiring "minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld." There's also a "Windows Performance Fit" rating to judge how well the game will run on your device.</p><p>Stay tuned to our Game Informer coverage to see our hands-on impressions with these devices.
