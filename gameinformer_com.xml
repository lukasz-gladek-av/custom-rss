Kennedy may play a role in the game, possibly as another playable character. Director Koshi Nakanishi seemingly silenced these rumors during last night’s Capcom Spotlight, where he revealed that Leon was initially considered for Requiem's starring role but was ultimately considered a bad fit for the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Nakanishi states that while they considered including the popular hero of Resident Evil 2 and 4, Requiem’s core concept of “addictive fear,” an experience so oppressively terrifying that players enjoy overcoming their fear, didn’t fit with Leon’s generally fearless and capable characterization.</p><p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult,” says Nakanishi. “He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>While this doesn't necessarily rule out that Leon could appear in a non-playable capacity, it seems like fans won't be getting their wish of controlling the former cop-turned-government agent in the new game. Capcom Spotlight also shared more about Resident Evil Requiem's story premise, themes, and the decision behind making Grace Ashcroft the lead. You can read all about it <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/capcom-reveals-new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-footage-and-discuss-its-narrative">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more about how the game is shaping up so far, we played it for 30 minutes during Summer Game Fest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last night’s Capcom Spotlight provided new information and snippets of gameplay for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/resident-evil-requiem-is-arriving-february-2026">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth mainline entry in the series. We learned the game's central theme and story setup, why Capcom chose Grace Ashcroft as its protagonist, and more.</p><p>Director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masachika Kawata explain that Requiem is a single-player offline adventure, and they dive into how the protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, represents a new type of lead for the franchise. Unlike previous stars like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, the FBI analyst is shy, timid, and not adept at fighting; she instead relies on her wits to gradually overcome her fears. This approach is designed to make players better identify with Grace since she’s essentially a normal person thrown into an extraordinarily horrifying situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Grace's relative helplessness also feeds into the game's core concept of "addictive horror", &nbsp;which Nakanishi explains is an experience so overwhelmingly scary that players become addicted to the challenge of conquering their fears. He also unexpectedly drops that Leon S. Kennedy was considered for the starring role but was ultimately <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/capcom-considered-leon-s-kennedy-a-bad-match-for-resident-evil-requiem">declared a bad fit</a>. &nbsp;You can watch Requiem's Spotlight segment starting at the 19:06 mark.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to showing off new gameplay footage from the upcoming game, the presentation lays out the premise: Requiem unfolds 30 years after the destruction of Raccoon City. The designers discuss how the city spawned so many stories, characters, and hardships for everyone connected to it, and that the new game is “a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before,”, hence the choice of the title. This theme of reflection is fitting, given that Requiem launches one month shy of the series’ 30th anniversary in March 2026.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
