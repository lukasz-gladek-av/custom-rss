            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire has piqued our curiosity for years, thanks to its fusion of black-and-white 30s-style animation and shooter mechanics reminiscent of classic Doom games. While it was slated for 2025, developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2416450/view/499462068471070731?l=english">the game was sliding into 2026 earlier this week</a>. However, this news also came with the caveat that the release date would be revealed at today's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, and sure enough, we just got a release date trailer. Mouse: P.I. For Hire will launch next year, on March 19. You can watch for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlwZMgDK-kQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Join P.I. Pepper in a world where danger lurks even in the tiniest mouse hole," reads a post announcing the date in the news tab of the game's Steam Community page. "Investigate a complex web of intrigue, corruption and murder with a thrilling noir-fueled detective story, lively environments to explore, an original big band jazz soundtrack and a fully-loaded arsenal of cartoon weapons and devastating power-ups."</p><p>While a delay is never ideal, it's nice to know an exact time to expect the game, especially since it's only five months away. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/05/15/mouse-is-a-noir-retro-shooter-inspired-by-classic-cartoons">Mouse's initial reveal came back in 2023</a>, with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/12/vintage-animation-shooter-mouse-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-and-2025-release-window">its release window of 2025 announced not much later</a>, so we've been anticipating its launch for a while. Most recently, we learned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QhWXpfjBjQ">the protagonist would be portrayed by none other than Troy Baker</a>, one of the most prolific game actors working today.</p><p>For more on shooters, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-6/battle-ready">check out our Battlefield 6 review</a>.
