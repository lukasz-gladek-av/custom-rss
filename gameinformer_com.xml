            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/19/hideo-kojima-says-physint-his-next-action-espionage-game-is-5-6-years-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hideo Kojima and PlayStation announced last year they were teaming up to create a new action espionage game called <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/01/31/kojima-productions-is-working-on-a-new-action-espionage-game-with-sony">Physint</a>, a welcome genre return for fans of Kojima’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ai1bh-D3K8">Metal Gear Solid</a> series. In a new interview with French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/index.php?option=com_papyrus&amp;view=recherche&amp;searchword=hideo+kojima"><em>Le Film Français</em></a>, Kojima said Physint is five to six years away from release.</p><p>This timeline isn’t too surprising – Kojima Productions’ next release is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> on June 26, and the studio is already developing its next game after that, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>, for Xbox. Assuming Kojima Productions has no other surprises, Kojima claimed last year that Physint's development would begin in earnest after the launch of Death Stranding 2 (likely up to bat after OD), so the five-to-six-year timeline makes sense.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film,” Kojima told <em>Le Film Français</em> when asked about directing a movie, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>.</p><p>Kojima also told the magazine he received many offers to direct a movie when <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/opinion-how-kojima-leaving-could-be-good-for-metal-gear.aspx?amp">he left Konami in 2015</a>. Considering how much Kojima loves films and the people behind them, seeing him direct one wouldn’t be surprising. Consider those extra-long Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding cutscenes practice for his directorial debut.</p><p>While waiting for Physint, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/building-a-stronger-connection"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Death Stranding 2 hands-on preview</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/how-death-stranding-2s-interactive-encyclopedia-helps-players-make-sense-of-the">Death Stranding 2’s interactive encyclopedia</a> helps players make sense of the lore. After that, check out this breakdown of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/meet-the-strange-and-powerful-members-of-drawbridge">the members of Death Stranding 2’s Drawbridge organization</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
