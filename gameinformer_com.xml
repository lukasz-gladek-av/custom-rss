            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has announced three more Amiibo for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star, King Dedede &amp; Tank Star, and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star Amiibo will join the game's figurine lineup that includes the previously announced <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/heres-every-new-amiibo-nintendo-revealed-during-todays-direct">Kirby &amp; Warp Star and Bandana Waddle Dee &amp; Winged Star Amiibo</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kirby &amp; Warp Star and Bandana Waddle Dee &amp; Winged Star Amiibo will be available starting November 20, the same day Kirby Air Riders launches for Switch 2, and each will cost $49.99. The Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star Amiibo will be available on March 5, 2026, while the other two newly announced Amiibo will be released sometime later in 2026. There's no price announced for the three new Amiibo revealed today, but they're likely to cost $49.99 each.&nbsp;</p><p>For a look at the different Amiibo for Kiry Air Riders, page through the gallery below:&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, all of the character pieces of each Amiibo can be swapped with other vehicles in this Amiibo line, and vice versa. Plus, Kirby Air Riders director Masahiro Sakurai revealed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_ZHYjYHHiBM?si=480dStqht5XlJdMa">today's hour-long Kirby Air Riders direct</a> that, at least, the Tank Star can be transformed from a ground mode to a gliding mode by reconfiguring the vehicle part of the figure. It's unclear if the other Amiibo can do this, though.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here's a look at the rearranged Amiibo:&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Wemade Max Co. and developer Madngine have released the first official trailer for Project Tal, a single-player, open-world action RPG inspired by Korean mythology. Though this trailer looks great, don't get too excited yet because the game is targeting a console and PC release sometime in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>Madngine says Project Tal "reimagined Korea's traditional Tal masks," as well as the mythology and Korean folklore that surrounds these special masks. It infuses this mythology into a fantasy open world for players to explore, and today's trailer showcases some of that world alongside the fast-paced action combat against huge monsters and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Project Tal announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see in the trailer, Project Tal features a companion system that ensures players aren't fighting alone in this dangerous world. Madngine says the companion system "dynamically responds to the player's combat style and environment" in a press release. Each NPC companion has unique abilities, combat roles, including up-close and ranged magic and melee prowess, and distinctive personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>"Project Tal combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG," Wemade Max Co. CEO Sohn Myun-seok writes in a press release. "With Madngine's technical expertise and artistic vision, we're creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage."</p><p>We'll have to wait until 2027 when Project Tal hits unspecified consoles and PC to see if that's the case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some additional Project Tal screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/11/nexon-unveils-woochi-the-wayfarer-a-single-player-korean-fantasy-action-adventure-game">read about Woochi the Wayfarer</a>, another single-player Korean fantasy action game in development, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4/relentless-exhausting-exhilarating"><em>Game Informer's </em>Ninja Gaiden 4 review</a> to find out why it's an action game we recommend you check out. &nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of our first official look at Project Tal?
