"Velmorne was once a town like any other, until its residents were twisted by witchcraft," a press release reads. "Disfigured and unformed, they roam deserted corners and squares, and ambush any foolish enough to wander down its forgotten roads."</p><p>The update also adds Rosary Beads, which can customize the player's abilities, overhauls the workshop system and player stats to make them easier to understand, and adds a new difficulty level: Gnosis IV.</p><p>You can read the full patch notes for yourself <a href="https://www.theastronauts.com/2023/09/witchfire-patch-notes/">on the game's website</a>. Witchfire is the current project of developer The Astronauts, known for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter â€“ <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_vanishing_of_ethan_carter/b/pc/archive/2014/10/02/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-game-informer-review.aspx">you can read our review of that game here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/28/witchfires-webgrave-update-launches-today]]></content:encoded>
