            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last March, Nintendo fans were ravenous for news about the Switch 2, speculating wildly and hoping for updates from any source. In this state of heightened anticipation, Nintendo did what it does best and did something no one expected; it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/tomodachi-life-returns-after-10-years-with-new-entry-living-the-dream">announced Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, a sequel to a 2014 3DS game the company hadn't touched in years</a>. Outside of a couple of brief trailers, however, we haven't had any more news on what the game will include, but that changes this week. Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct entirely focused on Tomodachi Life's sequel for this coming Thursday.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fghz93zCdY" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fghz93zCdY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The stream will be hosted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo's YouTube channel</a> on Thursday, January 29, at 6 a.m. PT/ 9 a.m. ET. According to the announcement on social media, it will last "roughly 20 minutes," so you can expect a good deal of information about the game and how it differs from its predecessor. Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream is currently scheduled for a Spring 2026 release window, so we're hoping to get a specific launch date from the presentation. Tomodachi Life is also a Switch 1 title, and while there might be upgrades announced for Switch 2, it will be available on both generations of Nintendo's hybrid console.</p><p>Tomodachi Life is a simulation game where Miis, Nintendo's customizable avatars, live out lives together and form relationships. As of March 2025, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/3ds.html">it was one of the best selling 3DS games of all time with 6.72 million units sold</a>.

Ahead of that, <em>Game Informer </em>went hands-on with the horror game for three hours, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/26/exciting-emulation">you can read that preview here</a>. However, as part of this preview, I interviewed Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi about what I had played.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll be publishing a full Q/A of that interview later today, but curiously, Nakanishi closed out our interview asking to address something I didn't specifically talk about: the game's world and exploration, specifically as it relates to rumors of Requiem being an open world Resident Evil. Nakanishi definitely shut those rumors down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[The development team] did just want to make clear one point," Nakanishi says through an interpreter. "They've seen some speculation of whether there's any open world elements in the game, and they just want to set the record straight that this isn't an open world game."</p><p>Welp, that's about as direct as it can get. Nakanishi continues, explaining, "The main concept behind this game is combining the very different gameplay of Grace and Leon into a cohesive package, and having those two gameplays represent the Resident Evil series, and I think when you play the game, you realize that, or you will find as well that the development team picked the best approach to do this."&nbsp;</p><p>For more about the game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/26/exciting-emulation">read my hands-on preview of Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/15/leon-kennedy-can-finally-use-a-chainsaw-in-resident-evil-requiem">check out the latest news from the Resident Evil showcase</a> that aired last month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During this weekend's Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri event, Bandai Namco revealed a cryptic trailer announcing the next Dragon Ball game. Known only as Age 1000, it’s slated to launch next year.</p><p>The mysterious trailer focuses on a new, original character designed by the late Dragon Ball creator, Akira Toriyama. The white-haired youth’s outfit and color scheme are somewhat reminiscent of Gohan’s Great Saiyan costume, and it interestingly bears the Capsule Corp name. The trailer shows the character effortlessly battling masked goons in a seemingly digital simulation, then ends with him transforming into a Super Saiyan. And of course, it wouldn’t be a Dragon Ball game without a Goku tease, who is briefly shown in the form of a silhouette.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLscMRafsLI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLscMRafsLI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“The world of Dragon Ball continues to expand with a brand-new Dragon Ball world and its entirely original characters— all brought to life by Akira Toriyama. Set for 2027, the 'Age 1000' project will introduce even more unique characters as the adventure unfolds,” reads Bandai Namco’s press release.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don’t know what type of game Age 1000 is or the platforms it will be released on. However, we won’t have to wait too long to learn more details as Bandai plans to share new information during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour, taking place April 18-19 in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/bandai-namco-reveals-age-1000-a-mysterious-new-dragon-ball-game]]></content:encoded>
