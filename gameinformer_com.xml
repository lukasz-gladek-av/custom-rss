            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enix has announced a new entry in its Dissidia Final Fantasy series, and it has a surprising premise. The game, which is coming to mobile devices next year, still features a who's who of Final Fantasy protagonists but unfolds in the modern day.</p><p>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy is set in current-day Tokyo, albeit a version that has a giant crystal at its center. This crystal appeared in the city some time ago, but by the time the game begins, the population has already adapted to its strange presence. That is, a negative energy pollutes the crystal, causing monsters to pour out of it and invade the city.&nbsp;</p><p>These creatures aren’t the only things to emerge; warriors hailing from various Final Fantasy games also arrive to save the day. But when they’re not fighting monsters, characters like Cloud and Lightning have assimilated into society and live ordinary lives (which includes wearing contemporary clothing) until they’re needed again, almost like they’re superheroes.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLM7V3jrNNc?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLM7V3jrNNc?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to a main story, which is fully voiced in Japanese, players will witness the daily lives of these FF heroes in short episodes. That includes text chats featuring characters such as Terra sharing their new outfits for other characters, like Warrior of Light, to comment on.&nbsp;</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy features 3v3 team boss battles as two teams race to defeat a giant boss the fastest, all while battling e roaming monsters along the way. As a mobile game, Dissidia's third-person action is designed to be played using only one hand.&nbsp;</p>
