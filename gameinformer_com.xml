            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It’s summer gaming showcase season, and the minds behind Little Nightmares are getting in on the fun by announcing a dedicated presentation for the franchise. The Little Nightmares Showcase has been revealed for next week and will likely have an update on the upcoming third entry.</p><p>All we know about the showcase for now is that it airs on June 24 at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET. The news was shared by the Little Nightmares III <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">X account</a>, with a post stating,</p><p>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think.</p><p>Are you ready to face it, little ones?&nbsp;</p><p>One would imagine the presentation will heavily revolve around Little Nightmares III, which was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2023/2023/08/23/little-nightmares-3-announced-for-2024-release-developed-by-until-dawn">first announced</a> at Gamescom 2023. Supermassive Games is developing the title, replacing the original creators, Tarsier Studios, which is currently working on a new horror platformer, <a href="https://youtu.be/mUymvhAXOnM?si=8nr9ft1tikkJkT9t">Reanimal</a>. Little Nightmares III was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/31/little-nightmares-iii-moves-into-2025">delayed to 2025</a> last year and has no concrete release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFO9Z_0wrKE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s also plausible we’ll learn concrete details for the long-rumored Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition. Though technically unannounced, the game’s existence <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/12/esrb-rates-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">first came to light</a> in late 2023 after it received a rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in South Africa. Much like the Enhanced Edition for Little Nightmares II that released in 2021 (also developed by Supermassive), this would presumably be a new-gen remaster of the 2017 original game.</p><p>Whether we get a Little Nightmares III release date or confirmation for the Enhanced Edition of the first title, we don’t have to wait long to find out either way. &nbsp;Until then, you can brush up on Little Nightmares III by checking out 18 minutes of gameplay <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/check-out-18-minutes-of-unsettling-little-nightmares-3-co-op-gameplay">here.</a>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope or expect to see during the Little Nightmares Showcase? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/20/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week]]></content:encoded>
