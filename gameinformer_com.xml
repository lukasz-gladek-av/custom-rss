In Horizon tradition, seasonal weather changes will shake up the visuals while also affecting how players drive.&nbsp;</p><p>Forza Horizon 6 will launch first on Xbox Series X/S (including day one on Game Pass) and PC via Windows and Steam in 2026. The game will also be released on PlayStation 5 sometime post-launch.
