            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/08/i-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-says-stardew-valleys-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>On a recent episode of the TigerBelly podcast, hosted by Stardew Valley superfan Bobby Lee (<em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Mad TV</em>), Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone said that a sequel is a possibility.&nbsp;"I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest,"&nbsp;Barone said during his extended discussion about the first game with Lee. Barone followed up that statement talking about how money is not the driving force behind creating Stardew Valley (or, by extension, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/07/05/haunted-chocolatier-feed-that-eerie-craving-with-what-we-know-so-far">Haunted Chocolatier</a>), which is why the game's updates have all been free.</p>



<p>It's far from an announcement of a Stardew Valley sequel and Barone did make mention of continuing work on Haunted&nbsp;Chocolatier saying that he has not yet completed the music for the game yet, but it's nice to know that a new Stardew Valley isn't outside of the realm of possibility in the future. You can check out the full podcast below, which is a fun chat from a genuine fan talking to the creator of their favorite thing.</p>
