Dubbed Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, players can throw down as their favorite Marvel heroes and villains next year.</p><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls raises the tag team stakes by pitting two teams of four characters against each other, who can be tagged in and out of combat on the fly. That makes for a whopping eight characters flying in and out of action each round. Fighting Souls features fast-paced action in titles such as Dragon Ball: FighterZ and BlazBlue, including flashy special attacks and cinematic finishing moves. Aesthetically, Marvel’s most popular characters are reimagined in Arc’s signature cel-shaded style and have distinctly Japanese flair, such as Iron Man’s more mecha-inspired suit.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>We don't know the full roster yet, but the trailer confirmed the following characters:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Spider-Man</li><li>Captain America</li><li>Iron Man</li><li>Storm</li><li>Dr. Doom</li><li>Star-Lord</li><li>Ms. Marvel</li><li>Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)</li></ul><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls is being published by PlayStation Studios and is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in 2026.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
