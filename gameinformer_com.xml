            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When it launched in 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild received near-universal acclaim, including a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild/b/switch/archive/2017/03/02/game-informer-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.aspx">10 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em></a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/01/04/game-informers-best-of-2017-awards.aspx">Game of the Year honors</a>. Nintendo has announced a partnership with Laced Records, a gaming-focused record label, to bring the beautiful and, at times, emotional soundtrack from one of the most beloved games of the 21st century to vinyl next year. This release marks one of the first major Nintendo titles to receive an official vinyl release outside of Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>The vinyl soundtrack release is available in a double-LP set or an expanded 8-LP box set. Each version is available in standard black vinyl or a special limited-edition colored variant: The double-LP comes in blue and white, while the 8-LP box set features blue and gold splatters on white discs. The double-LP releases feature 34 select tracks, including "Overworld (Day)," "Great Fairy Fountain," and "Hyrule Castle." Meanwhile, the 8-LP releases include 130 tracks, and each disc is sequenced around a theme from Breath of the Wild, such as exploration, freeing the Divine Beasts, and discovering Shrines. All the tracks have been remastered for vinyl, aiming to provide the best translation of the work of composers Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, Hajime Wakai, and Soshi Abe.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild vinyl soundtrack collection arrives on June 19, 2026, with pre-orders available today. The limited-edition blue versions will be available exclusively through Laced Records, the My Nintendo Store, Nintendo New York, and Nintendo San Francisco, while the standard-edition black vinyl versions will be available at select retailers.</p><hr><p><em><span>Do you have any game soundtracks on vinyl?
