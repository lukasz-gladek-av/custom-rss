            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-shows-off-six-major-areas-of-vice-city-in-grand-theft-auto-vi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">There's a new Grand Theft Auto VI trailer</a>, and even though <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">the game was recently delayed to May of next year</a>, developer Rockstar opened the floodgates today with new information. Vice City, where the game takes place, has a personality of its own. In addition to new details about the game's story and characters, the GTA VI website has loads of information about the game's new major areas, along with plenty of new screenshots. Here's a breakdown of what we know about each of them.</p>



<p>According to Rockstar's website, the game's central metropolis has "the glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city." Notable locations include Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>



<h2>Leonida Keys</h2>

<p>A clear parody of the Florida Keys, the Leonida Keys are a beachside tropical paradise, complete with retirees, casual boating, and sea turtles. The site's description also describes it as some of the most "dangerous waters in all of America."</p>



<h2>Grassrivers</h2>

<p>This swampy biome is full of danger. Rockstar says it's got even "deadlier predators" than the state's infamous alligators, and based on the screenshots, I can only assume those predators are the wetlands' intimidating, heavily armed residents.</p>



<h2>Port Gellhorn</h2>

<p>This sketchy area used to be a popular vacation spot, but now its stores have been abandoned and its parking lots are filled with "malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks." As a tourist, I'd be scared, but seeing as I'll be playing as two lovers with a penchant for the illegal, it seems like a great spot to make some money.</p>



<h2>Ambrosia</h2>

<p>The "heart of Leonida" is known for its "old school values," factories, and local biker gang. Based on the screenshots, it also looks like the economy partially relies on farms (even if this one is on fire), and the locals rely on some particularly patriotic women to wash their cars.</p>



<h2>Mount Kalaga National Park</h2>

<p>Full of wildlife and wilderness, the National Park is lush with greenery. Rockstar says the park will have "prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails," potentially hinting at some of the series' numerous elaborate minigames.</p>
