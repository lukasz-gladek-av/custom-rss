            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Paramount has announced a new live-action Sonic film slated to release during the 2028 holiday season. The film is being dubbed as a “Sonic universe” movie, suggesting it could be some type of spin-off instead of a direct numbered sequel.</p><p>Per <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, all we know about this yet-to-be-titled fifth Sonic film project is that it will be produced by Mortiz’s Original Film and Sega Sammy Group. The project does not have a director attached, nor an announced cast. The previous three Sonic movies have all been directed by Jeff Fowler and have starred Ben Schwartz as Sonic, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, with Idris Elba and Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Knuckles and Tails, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever form this movie takes, it will arrive over a year after the already announced <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-1236262719/"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>, scheduled to hit theaters on March 19, 2027. Though it may be a little strange to announce another Sonic movie when we hardly know anything about the next one, it's not unexpected given the box office successes of the last three films. The Sonic film trilogy has grossed a combined $1.2 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Your guess is as good as ours as to what this Sonic universe film will be. Is it merely Sonic 5, or a spin-off starring a different character à la the Paramount+ <a href="https://gameinformer.com/series-review/2024/04/22/knuckles-show-review-a-low-stakes-climb"><em>Knuckles</em></a> series?&nbsp; Let us know what you think in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/sonic-universe-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movies-1236631873/"><em>Deadline</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/paramount-announces-a-new-sonic-universe-film-for-holiday-2028]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been nearly four years since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-announced-by-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7f08d7-a850-4def-a34c-dea649945f96" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Ubisoft announced its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the developer doesn't have much to show off quite yet, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/11/17/new-splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-and-details-revealed-in-anniversary-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d24df20a-5973-4edd-9a2e-bb04b04c2d46" data-entity-substitution="canonical">outside of a few pieces of concept art</a>. Last week, however, we did get a minor production update on the project from someone with firsthand knowledge of the game. David Grivel is returning as Splinter Cell remake's game director, a role he held years ago before leaving to work at EA.</p><p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!" <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACOWhuwBwYrSgCaAXycFQL8Ess7nITKi_yU">Grivel's LinkedIn post announcing the news reads</a>. "A very special team and project to me," the message concludes, complete with a heart emoji. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em>, which noticed this post before we did.</a>)</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Grivel worked at Ubisoft from 2011 to 2022, spending most of his time at the Toronto offices as a senior or lead game designer, with credits on projects like Assassin's Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, 6, and Primal, and most importantly, Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Starting in 2021, he transitioned to being the game director on the Splinter Cell remake, a position he held until late 2022, when he left to work on Battlefield 6. He briefly returned to Ubisoft in 2024, but left to join a studio, Worlds Untold, that unfortunately shut down right as he was supposed to be starting.</p><p>Now, Grivel has returned to the team he left three years ago, though it's unclear what, if anything , this means for the remake, especially since the last update came a month or so after he left, before any real impact would have been clear. At the very least, it's a sign of life that confirms Ubisoft still intends to follow through with the project. Here's hoping we'll see a more concrete update sometime soon.</p><p>[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>]</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/01/game-director-david-grivel-rejoins-splinter-cell-remake-after-leaving-in-late-2022]]></content:encoded>
