            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Cory Barlog (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFbeaM0hp_c">pictured above being asked rapid-fire questions about God of War</a>), director of God of War II and 2018's God of War, shared some vague details about what the team at Sony Santa Monica is currently working on. Sony Santa Monica is the developer, most recently, behind God of War Ragnarök.</p><p>"I’d like to share a little bit about our new project," Barlog wrote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cory.barlog.357128/posts/pfbid0JHwrN1fGFLZGN5BBa7qneq6Qcc3prpVKvHpfPnZBewgcnZ4sehaHporp97xaLq3Jl">Facebook</a>. "I’m incredibly proud of what the team at Santa Monica Studio has been accomplishing. It’s a technically ambitious project, something that’s not easy to achieve. This is a new IP we’ve been working on for years, and if all goes well, we’re planning to show it to you later this year. I couldn’t be more excited." Barlog ended the post with two heart emojis.</p><p>Barlog's post doesn't specify that this is Sony Santa Monica <em>next</em> project or that it is its <em>only</em> project. Since the release of Ragnarök's free rogue-lite mode DLC, it has been quiet about what's next.</p><p>In terms of God of War, developer Bluepoint Games (primarily known for its remakes of Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls) was working on a live-service game connected to the God of War franchise. That game was publicly cancelled earlier this year according to a statement Sony shared with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>Whatever this new project may be, we will apparently learn more about it later this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-working-on-a-new-technically-ambitious-ip]]></content:encoded>
