Rise of Hydra, which is led by Amy Hennig of Jak and Daxter and Uncharted fame, was initially set to launch sometime this year.</p><p>While this delay is likely disappointing for Marvel fans excited about the single-player action-adventure team-up of Captain America and Black Panther Azurri (T'Challa's grandfather) during World War II, it’s not too surprising. The last time we heard about this game was in March of 2024, when Skydance released the first <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-skydances-captain-americablack-panther-game-arriving-next">cinematic trailer</a> for the game.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have an important update: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early&nbsp; 2026,” a statement from Skydance Games posted to X reads. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!”&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>You can learn more about what Skydance has planned for Marvel 1943 Rise of Hydra by reading our 2022 interview While waiting to learn more about what Skydance is cooking up for Rise of Hydra, check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/the-league-of-upcoming-superhero-games"><em>Game Informer’s</em> list of upcoming superhero games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and is free for existing owners of the original game on those platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally developed in Unreal Engine 4, the remastered version of The Sinking City has been fully relit in Unreal Engine 5 with 4K textures, improved reflections, support for PC features like DLSS and FSR upscaling, a new Photo Mode, and more. It also features “enhanced locations with additional levels of detail and objects,” according to a press release from Frogware. Check out The Sinking City Remastered launch trailer below for a comparison between the original game and this new version.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEoQxVMzBEg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEoQxVMzBEg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond,” Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan writes in a press release. “So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.”&nbsp;</p><p>Frogwares announced that it was working on The Sinking City Remastered back in March, but it didn’t indicate when it would be released. It made this announcement alongside news of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">Kickstarter campaign</a> to help fund the development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>. That campaign ended in April, raising roughly $627,000, 450% above Frogware’s initial Kickstarter goal.&nbsp;</p><p>For more about Frogwares, read our original <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-sinking-city/macabre-tales-and-mediocre-gameplay">review of The Sinking City</a> and about how <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/19/ukrainian-developer-frogwares-reveals-new-game-calls-it-clear-middle-finger-to-russian">the company’s next game is a “clear middle finger” to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Revealed to a live audience at PAX East 2025 in Boston over the weekend, the trailer features a new look at gameplay and a quick glimpse at a boss fight against an armored Omen Beast bear named Bromius.&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer also showcases the game’s combat, with clips of sword-based gameplay and Soulframe’s magick system. Unlike the ultra-fast combat of Warframe, which is not a part of the Soulframe universe despite a similar name, Soulframe slows things down a bit for a more deliberate action experience. Check it out for yourself in the new Soulframe trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Digital Extremes plans to release Soulframe in 2025 on PC. It is currently in pre-alpha and select people have been able to play it. If you anticipate playing Soulframe when it launches, you can reserve your envoy name on the game’s <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en">website</a> today.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for the launch of Soulframe, check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/warframe/b/playstation4/archive/2013/11/25/warframe-review-game-informer.aspx"><em>Game Informer’s</em> review of Warframe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
