SAG-AFTRA has announced it has reached a tentative agreement with signatory game companies, including Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.&nbsp;</p><p>The agreement is subject to review and approval by the National Board and ratification by members in the coming weeks, and it is expected that the terms <span>of a strike suspension agreement will be finalized with employers soon, according to SAG-AFTRA. When that agreement is finalized, the strike that began July 16 last year will end. However, until that agreement is finalized, the strike will continue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland writes in a press release. "Patience and persistence have resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In the same press release, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher wrote, "Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world's most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified, we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The aforementioned strike began last July after </span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/26/sag-aftra-members-vote-yes-to-authorize-video-game-strike"><span>SAG-AFTRA members approved a strike authorization in September of 2023</span></a><span> with a 98.32% yes vote. Though SAG-AFTRA executives sound happy about the agreement, we won't know how it specifically addresses AI and other concerns that led to the strike until the ratification materials are officially released in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Splatoon Raiders is the first game announced for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/tech/2025/06/09/switch-2-review-a-safe-but-effective-bet">Switch 2</a> by Nintendo since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/impressions/2025/06/05/game-informer-editors-share-their-early-nintendo-switch-2-impressions">the launch of the console last week</a>, and it was revealed in the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/nintendos-day-old-app-reveals-the-release-date-for-the-live-action-zelda-movie">Nintendo Today app</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing as a mechanic, you'll adventure to the mysterious Spirhalite Islands alongside Deep Cut, the idol trio of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> that consists of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man. Though the reveal trailer doesn't show too much, it seems players will be exploring a set of islands while chasing after a mysterious yellow beam shooting into the sky within a tornado or water cyclone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Splatoon Raiders reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer teases that "research" is still underway on Splatoon Raiders, likely indicating there's some time to go before the game is ready for launch. Nonetheless, considering <span>that Splatoon 3 has surpassed 10 million units sold and </span><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/09/12/splatoon-3-had-the-best-launch-ever-for-a-switch-game-in-japan">had the best launch for a Switch game in Japan</a>, a new Splatoon game is exciting.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word on when to expect Splatoon Raiders, but Nintendo says it will launch exclusively on Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in today's Squid Research Lab Report, Nintendo revealed that version 10 of Splatoon 3 is on its way. It will feature the Splatlands Collection, which consists of 30 weapons from the series' past but refreshed for the game. Plus, weapon freshness caps will be raised, and players can earn new in-game badges. And in the Anarchy Battle Series, players can utilize the Series Weapon Power, a new stat that tracks your effectiveness with a weapon based on your win-loss ratio in battles. It will also be used in matchmaking to put you up against players with similar stats.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not all, though. Nintendo also revealed that Urchin Underpass, a map from the first Splatoon game, will return to the rotation of Splatoon 3. And for Switch 2 players, an upgrade will bring improved visuals, including better resolution and more. The company says this update won't affect play capabilities between Switch and Switch 2 players when it launches this week on June 12.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for this update, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/splatoon-3/multicolored-mayhem"><em>Game Informer's </em>Splatoon 3 review</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope Splatoon Raiders is?
