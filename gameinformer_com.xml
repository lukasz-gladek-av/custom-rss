The update, titled The Regal, will add new characters, more balls, and other features.</p><p>The Regal arrives on Monday, January 26, and adds two characters to the ball-bouncing, town-building roguelike: The Carouser and The Falconer. As detailed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481">Steam post</a>, the Carosuer’s ability allows returning balls to orbit around him, while The Falconer has two falcons at her side that throw balls.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight new balls join the game alongside several new passives that have not been detailed. The developer also teases an additional surprise it’s saving until the update launches. You can watch a YouTube short of the update in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vgGaNZTeEIg">here</a>.</p><p>The Regal is the first of three big post-launch updates planned for Ball x Pit in 2026. The two remaining updates, Shadow and Naturalist, are slated to arrive in April and July, respectively. The Regal is coming to all versions of Ball x Pit on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/ball-x-pits-first-free-update-adds-new-characters-balls-and-more-next-week]]></content:encoded>
