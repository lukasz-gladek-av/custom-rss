            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>With Nintendo's next Switch 2 exclusive game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, just <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">two days away from launch</a>, the company has released a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">three-part interview series</a> about the game's development. In the final section of the series, one of Bananza's directors, Kazuya Takahashi, said players can skip locations and parts of the story in the game, thanks to its unique destruction gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a lot of leeway in terms of progression in this game," Takahashi said when asked about any final words he might have to close out the interview. "For example, locations or parts of the story you can skip without suffering any consequences. When the game progresses in a way we hadn't intended, we call it a 'sequence break' in development terminology. Typically, in game development, restrictions are put in place to prevent this from happening, but since this game is all about destruction, we wanted people to play freely."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it sounds like there's a lot of leeway given to players when it comes to destruction and what they're able to accomplish by destroying the environment around them. It can even lead to skipping story sections or locations; however, given Nintendo's typically high standard of quality, it's unlikely that players will be able to skip critical parts of the game. Regardless, Takahashi said this newfound freedom from restrictions makes things easier for the development team.&nbsp;</p><p>"But please do experiment," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, there are just two days left until everyone can begin experimenting with Donkey Kong's destructive abilities because Donkey Kong Bananza launches exclusively on Switch 2 this Thursday, July 17.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/01/our-impressions-after-two-hours-of-gameplay"><em>Game Informer's </em>hands-on preview impressions</a> after two hours with the game, and then check out this <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ngt/2025/07/01/we-played-two-hours-of-donkey-kong-bananza-new-gameplay-today">Donkey Kong Bananza New Gameplay Today</a>.
