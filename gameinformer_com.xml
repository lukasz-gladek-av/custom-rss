This clean version of the intro cinematic allows fans and newcomers to more clearly enjoy the newly recorded vocals for the classic “Snake Eater” song.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Although this new version retains the James Bond-like motion graphics and slithering snake skeleton, it features completely new scenes compared to the 2004 original. For example, this updated version highlights the members of the Cobra Unit who were absent from the original. “Snake Eater” has also been re-recorded by its original performer, Cynthia Harrell.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a complete remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. The original story and voice acting have been preserved, but the game features enhancements such as 3D audio and new graphical flourishes, such as Snake's clothing degrading over time. The control scheme has been reworked and modernized, but fans can still play using the classic control setup. Additionally, the remake lets players choose between experiencing the game using a new third-person behind-the-shoulder view and the original game's overhead viewpoint (known as Legacy Style).&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can pick up Naked Snake's revamped adventure when it launches on August 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
