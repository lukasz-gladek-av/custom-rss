Perkins and Crawford will now serve as Darrington Press' Creative Director and Game Director, respectively, <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/">according to an announcement on the company's website</a>.</p><p>This is a massive shakeup for the TTRPG world. Critical Role, known for its livestreamed games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons played by high-profile voice actors, launched Darrington Press in 2020. While the company's first projects were Critical Role adjacent, this year it released Daggerheart, a standalone role-playing game designed to compete with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other similar games. The cast is currently in the midst of a mini-arc using the game system, and fans have speculated the company might intend to move away from D&amp;D entirely one day.</p>

<p>By bringing on Crawford and Perkins, Darrington Press's pedigree increases significantly. The two have worked at Wizards of the Coast for many years (Crawford for 18, Perkins for 28), and are considered two of the primary architects behind Dungeons and Dragons' extremely popular fifth edition and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/the-art-of-the-new-dungeons-dragons">its 2024 overhaul of that ruleset</a>. The designers were public spokespeople for the brand as well, appearing in videos to explain new books or playtests and even clarifying rules on social media. Shortly after the new books were released, however, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisperkinsdnd.bsky.social/post/3llyvdjkphk2p">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://screenrant.com/jeremy-crawford-chris-perkins-leaving-dnd-interview/">Jeremy Crawford</a> each announced they had decided to leave the company.</p><p>Their jump to Darrington is an unexpected move, to say the least, but it seems Wizards of the Coast was aware of the transition, making a point to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3lrqh6lyth22l">congratulate the move on Bluesky</a>. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-06-16/critical-role-raids-dungeons-and-dragons-coffers-to-sign-storytelling-duo">The pair also did an interview with <em>The Los Angeles Times</em></a><em> </em>explaining their decision process and generally praising the Critical Role team.</p><p>The two will be "developing novel game concepts as well as expanding the games [Darrington has] released so far," according to the announcement. This likely involves additions to Daggerheart, which launched a few weeks ago. For more Daggerheart and its inspirations, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/tabletop/2025/05/15/exclusive-diving-deep-into-critical-roles-daggerheart">you can read our interview with its lead game designer, Spenser Starke</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/borderlands-4-standard-edition-confirmed-to-cost-70<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gearbox has opened pre-orders for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-deep-dive-details-new-vault-hunters-open-world-changes-loot-shakeups-and">Borderlands 4</a>, confirming a $69.99 price for the Standard Edition. This news alleviates fan concern that the upcoming shooter would retail at $80 and follows CEO Randy Pitchford’s controversial comment last month that “real fans” would find a way to purchase the game at that price.</p><p>The worry over Borderlands 4’s price stemmed from an <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">exchange on X</a> with Randy Pitchford on May 13 where a fan told him the game “better not be 80 dollars.” Pitchford responded by saying the decision was “Not my call”, then added the following:</p><p>“If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.”</p><p>Pitchford’s comment attracted criticism from those who took this as him implying that players who couldn’t afford to pay $80 are not true fans. It also fueled speculation that Borderlands 4 would indeed follow the growing trend set by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">Mario Kart World</a> of retailing at the higher price point.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, Pitchford addressed his comment by <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">sharing a clip</a> from a PAX East developer panel (which occurred before Pitchford’s controversial X post), where he elaborated on Borderlands 4’s then-potential price by speaking on the current realities of video game development budgets and pricing.</p><p>“It’s an interesting time, right?” says Pitchford during the Q&amp;A session. “On one level, we’ve got a competitive marketplace where the people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. So there’s some folks who don’t want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There’s other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there’s tariffs for the retail packaging and it’s getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is, I don’t know what the price is going to be.”</p><p>He then added, “As artists, we want everybody to have it. We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we’re creating.”</p>
