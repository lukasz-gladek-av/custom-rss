            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Majjam is a newly announced cooperative multiplayer game where players interact with the world and each other entirely through music. It is the debut project by French developer Opus Major.&nbsp;</p><p>In Majjam, interactions occur through music, which serves as the life force for its whimsical world. When a dark corruption called Kodé infects everything with its silence, players must combine their musical talents and instruments to fend it off, also known as Jamming. Creating melodies is not only used in combat but also to solve puzzles and explore and unlock new parts of the environment. The Jam ability of each of Majjam’s distinct character types, such as woodwind or percussion players, is bolstered by unlockable musical abilities, which each have a unique power.&nbsp;</p><p>Players team up in online co-op (the number of which is unclear), and Opus Major states that the game's technology auto-harmonizes online players' performances with minimal noticeable latency. &nbsp;The developer also stresses that Majjam is not a rhythm game; instead of emphasizing musical skill, it focuses on communal creation and expression through simple, intuitive mechanics. Check out the teaser trailer below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8_l6CHw6O4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8_l6CHw6O4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“In music, a jam is a suspended moment — a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there,” reads a statement from Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin. &nbsp;"You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together. It’s that same spark you sometimes feel in a multiplayer game. Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience.”</p><p>Majjam does not have a release window, but you can <a href="https://www.majjam.com/">sign up </a>to participate in a closed alpha in September. The game is currently targeted to launch on PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/08/majjam-is-a-co-op-musical-adventure-about-saving-the-world-through-jam-sessions]]></content:encoded>
