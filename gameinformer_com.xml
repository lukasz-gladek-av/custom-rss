            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder was one of Nintendo's flagship games on the original Nintendo Switch when it was released in 2023. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/every-switch-2-upgrade-from-the-september-2025-nintendo-direct-including">While its Switch 2 upgrade was announced a while ago</a>, today we got some more details about what to expect and when it's coming out. First things first: you can get the upgrade and content expansion in just over two months on March 26, and it'll cost $19.99.</p><p>Attraction Central is Bellabel Park's main sell, inviting players to a new area full of co-op and competitive minigames. The attractions are divided into two sections – local and wireless/online. The former can also be played with GameShare – meaning one Switch 2 owner can share it with nearby Switch or Switch 2 players that might not have the game – while the latter is built around players having individual screens and moving at their own paces.</p><p>Today's trailer also revealed Camp Central, a new area in the park where you can participate in the Toad Brigade Training Camp. These levels unlock as you complete stages in the main game, and give alternate challenge modes to levels you've already completed. Examples in the footage include defeating enemies, collecting coins in a time limit, and completing the level while maintaining invincibility.</p><p>Of course, Bellabel Park isn't all fun and games, and you can blame the Koopalings for that. They'll appear and scatter across the game's various worlds, and players will have to track them down, a task seemingly aided by an explorer Toad in each kingdom. We don't see much of these villainous turtles, however, because the trailer quickly pivots to the reveal that Rosalina will be playable with the update. She has no special abilities, and joins the main cast in all modes.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVB3hZoOF0A"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVB3hZoOF0A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The update also adds some more accessibility options, specifically geared towards younger children. Co-Star Luma can join if there are at least two players, and can freely fly around a level. Luma can collect coins and spin to defeat enemies, but can't die, so it's ideal for someone who wants to participate but isn't coordinated enough to play. Since this is exclusive to the Switch 2 version, it also adds mouse controls for Luma, so it's even accessible to those who can't quite use a joystick. There's also a new Assist Mode which accomplishes a similar function, making players immune to damage and automatically surviving falls with a flying flower.</p><p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (man, what a long title) is out March 26 exclusively on Switch 2.
