            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Amazon Prime has been on a streak of adapting popular video games into live-action TV series, and the biggest project in the news this year has been its upcoming take on God of War. After weeks of casting announcements, the service revealed the first look at what leads Ryan Hurst and Callum Vinson will look like as Kratos and Atreus, respectively. Take a look for yourself below.</p>

<p>The image was posted on social media with the caption, "Father and Son. Behold your first look at Kratos and Atreus in the God of War series now in production. Their journey to the highest peak begins."</p><p>The show aims to retell the events of 2018's God of War, a soft reboot that sees the series' vicious protagonist travel to a new land and take a second swing at fatherhood. In addition to the main cast of the 2018 game, Amazon has already cast major players from the sequel, Ragnarök, like Thor and Odin.

<h2>Game Music Collection</h2><p>The stream kicked off with a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2026/02/27/game-boy-shaped-pokemon-soundtrack-player-announced">Game Music Collection jukebox for Pokémon Red and Blue</a>, with 45 songs on 45 cartridges for the standalone music player. It basically looks like a HitClips for classic Pokémon music. Remember HitClips? Anyways, that's available starting on February 27 (today).</p><h2>Pokémon World Championships and XP 2026</h2><p>The Pokémon XP and World Championships are headed to San Francisco on August 28 through 30, and today The Pokémon Company confirmed all the activities happening there. It's not just competition and fighting for the crown; the Pokémon XP expo will host several different events and places for families and friends to hang out and celebrate Pokémon. Plus, we got some new artwork today, commemorating the event.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Trading Card Game</h2><p>We got a look at the "future" of Pokémon Trading Card Game with a set celebrating the series' 30th anniversary releasing sometime in 2026. The stream showed off everything from classic cards to Tag Teams and more, so look forward to that if you're a fan of cracking Pokémon packs.</p><p>Numerous Pokémon that have appeared in past Pokémon Go events will return, as part of the game's 10th anniversary alongside the series' 30th. (Can you believe it's been a decade since that blissful, wonderful Pokémon Go summer?) The anniversary event runs in early March, and Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos starts tomorrow on Saturday, February 28. Make sure to grab the promotion with promo code GOTOURKALOS, valid until Monday, March 2.</p><h2>Pokémon Masters EX</h2><p>Red (1996) &amp; Pikachu are out today, with two more Trainers joining soon too: Florian &amp; Ogerpon (Anniversary 2026) on February 28, and Juliana &amp; Terapagos (Anniversary 2026) on March 2. It's the 6.5 Year Celebration for Pokémon Masters EX (it's a real anniversary, I swear), and you can also pick up 3,000 gems for logging in sometime between now and March 31.</p>

<h2>Nintendo Switch Online</h2><p>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness, a lesser-known spin-off, is finally coming to Nintendo Switch Online's GameCube selection in March 2026. Honestly, this is huge news for anyone who's wanted to see what this odd side game is about, but doesn't want to pay exorbitant sums for a physical GameCube copy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</h2><p>As <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/20/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-are-coming-to-switch-switch-2-digitally-next-week">previously confirmed</a>, the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokémon Gen 1 are coming to Nintendo Switch. They're out today, and feature Pokémon Home integration as part of their modern Switch release.</p><h2>Pokémon Champions Arrives In April</h2><p>The battle-focused Pokémon experience comes to Switch in April, with a mobile version expected to arrive later this year. This is a client focused solely on facing off against other trainers, as shown by the trailer today, but might be a pretty cool thing for the competitive Pokémon players out there.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Legends Z-A Gets More Mega</h2><p>The latest Pokémon Legends entry arrived last year with Z-A, and it's getting a fresh crop of content in 2026. Mega Garchomp Z will be available for owners of the Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon Legends Z-A today. Interesting that it's tied to owning both the game and DLC, but the new Garchomp <em>does </em>look pretty cool.</p><h2>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;</h2><p>Pokopia is just days away now, but there's still some news to show off before the cozy Poké-life sim goes live. DJ Rotom is a special stereo-focused form of the techno-Pokémon, able to play CDs that the player-Ditto finds. We also got a look at a culinary master Greedent named Chef Dente, who might be my new favorite Pokémon ever. The stream also showed off the four-player multiplayer town visits and other facets of Pokémon Pokopia. The new building-and-living sim arrives on March 5 for Switch 2, and honestly looks delightful.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Winds and Waves</h2><p>The 10th generation of Pokémon has been confirmed as Pokémon Winds and Waves, in a yet-unnamed but seemingly tropical region. We got glimpses of many different biomes and the Pokémon that will inhabit them, as well as a resort-like structure and towns built on the water. Plus, our three new apparent starters: the little bird Browt, the fire puppy Pombon, and water amphibian Gecqua. Also, possibly a tease for diving and underwater activities? This generation of Pokémon will aim for a global release in 2027 on the Switch 2, and we'll likely learn more about it later.</p><hr><p><em><span>How did you feel about this year's Pokémon Day Pokémon Presents livestreams?
