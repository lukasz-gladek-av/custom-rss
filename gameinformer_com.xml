            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's almost time to shuffle up and get in the robot. <em>Game Informer </em>can exclusively reveal that Battle Suit Aces, the new mecha card-battling game from Trinket Studios, will arrive on October 7 for PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC.</p><p>Trinket Studios made a splash with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/battle_chef_brigade/b/switch/archive/2017/11/20/battle-chef-brigade-review.aspx">2017's Battle Chef Brigade</a>, which mixed side-scrolling action with a match-3 puzzle system to portray a fantasy cooking competition. Similarly, Battle Suit Aces also blends several genres and concepts; in a card-fighting RPG, you follow the USS Zephyr and its crew through a planet-hopping voyage across the stars to try and stop a looming, universe-endangering threat.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhKcqp1oxG4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhKcqp1oxG4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Card battles play out on a board, where you can deploy your team of mechs, pilots, and drones to combat the enemy, trying to strike through their lines and destroy their base before they do the same. Between missions, you'll be able to recruit and get to know your crewmates, as well as upgrade their mech suits.</p><p>Trinket is planning numerous story missions driven by both the plot and your recruited cast of characters, as well as a story influenced by the factions you support and the relationships you build. Different Factions can also help you lean into your chosen playstyle, too, opting for specific methods of crushing your enemies with your small army of pilot pals and giant mecha.</p><p>No word on exact pricing just yet, but Trinket Studios has confirmed it will launch Battle Suit Aces on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC via Steam.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/09/09/battle-suit-aces-the-latest-from-battle-chef-studio-trinket-launches-its-mecha]]></content:encoded>
