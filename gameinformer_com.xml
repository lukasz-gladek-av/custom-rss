            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The 2024 remake of Silent Hill 2 is now available on Xbox Series X/S. If that wasn’t a surprise enough, Xbox owners can purchase the game at a special launch discount of up to 50 percent off the standard platform pricing.</p><p>It had been rumored that Silent Hill 2, which launched for PlayStation 5 and PC in October 2024, was heading to Xbox after fans spotted an ESRB rating for this version last month. Konami gave no advance announcement of this edition, and only officially revealed its existence hours after the game stealthily launched on the Australian Xbox Store yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>The standard edition of Silent Hill 2 normally retails at $69.99, but the launch discount drops this price to $34.99. The $79.99 Deluxe Edition is currently on sale for $39.99.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aFrvEu2Ku8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aFrvEu2Ku8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Developed by Bloober Team, the remake of Silent Hill 2 has received heaps of praise, including scoring an 8.75 out of 10 from us at <em>Game Informer</em>. Reviewer Kye Hilliard wrote in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/silent-hill-2/engrossing-and-unsettling">his review</a> that,</p><p>“Bloober’s take on Silent Hill 2 is engrossing, even if words I would usually use to compliment other games like “fun” simply don’t apply here. I experienced the original game shortly after its first release, but I was still eager to see where the story was going and what new ways I would dive into the psyche of James and the others he met in Silent Hill. Despite the difficult revelations Silent Hill 2 unveils along the way and how uncomfortable the experience made me (by design) I was eager to immediately start the journey again after seeing the credits.”</p><p>To read more about Silent Hill 2, check out this news about its upcoming live-action film adaptation, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/check-out-the-official-teaser-trailer-for-silent-hill-2-movie-adaptation-return-to"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a>. &nbsp;Konami recently announced that Bloober Team is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill">remaking the first Silent Hill game</a>.
