While it's available to play on Valve's Steam Deck handheld, last year's Switch 2 launch had many wondering whether it would make the jump to Nintendo's new platform as well. Hopes only raised higher with the recent announcement that Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian's previous game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-surprise-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2-today" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a272ebc-a75c-4126-9e9e-c733a87a4849" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Divinity Original Sin II, would come to modern platforms, including the Switch 2</a>. However, it seems that the D&amp;D adaptation is likely not going to follow in its footsteps.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The news comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a recent Reddit AMA</a> (Ask Me Anything) in which some members of Larian Studios answered questions for members of the r/Games subreddit. When user u/darkwai asked "Baldur's Gate 3 for Switch 2? Is it even possible?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Larian game director Swen Vincke replied</a>, "We would have loved to but it [sic] wasn't our decision to make."</p><p>Vincke is potentially alluding to the now-fractured relationship between Larian and D&amp;D IP owner Wizards of the Coast. After Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new">Larian canceled its DLC plans and decided to end its relationship with Wizards of the Coast</a> to return to its fully independent state. Despite the studio's continued support of the game, it's not the sole owner of the rights, so there are some potential hurdles that might come with bringing it to other platforms. That said, this is all speculation – all we know for sure is that a Switch 2 version of Baldur's Gate 3 likely won't happen.</p><p>For more on Larian's future, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-announces-new-divinity-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed08ab47-df0c-45ae-ab3b-a95c069bbf7d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">check out the announcement of their next game, currently just known as Divinity</a>.
