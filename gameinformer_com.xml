This marks the series' first appearance on a Nintendo platform since WWE 2K18 in 2017.</p><p>2K states the Switch 2 version of WWE’s latest wrestling sim will feature all the same game modes as its PlayStation, Xbox, and PC brethren. WWE 2K25 centers on The Bloodline and features a new Showcase mode highlighting the prominent members of the Anoaʻi/Maivia wrestling dynasty, including The Rock, Roman Reigns, Yokozuna, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The game features a new mode called The Island, a new hub filled with quests and mini-games as players compete to earn a WWE contract. WWE 2K25 features new stipulations, including Bloodline Rules and the Underground Match, as well as the introduction of intergender gameplay across all match types.
