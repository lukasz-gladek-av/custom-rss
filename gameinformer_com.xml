            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We are so stoked to reveal that Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will grace the cover of the December issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine! <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">Subscribe today</a> to receive this issue when it launches digitally on November 4, with physical issues hitting mailboxes in the weeks following. Like all subscribers, you'll also receive complete access to all our digital archive of past <em>Game Informer</em> issues to explore at your leisure.&nbsp;</p><p>Today is a very special day for <em>Game Informer</em>, too, because this is the first time ever (<strong>somehow</strong>) that we've had a Dragon Quest game on the cover in our more than 30 years of history. This issue highlights both Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and, in a feature accompanying the cover story, the history of the Dragon Quest franchise, going all the way back to 1986.</p><p>This issue's cover image showcases the new and, dare we say, reimagined look of Dragon Quest VII in this new remake from Square Enix. Square Enix worked with a local premium doll maker to create real-life dolls of the protagonist Hero and their accompanying party, and then scanned them into the game. This approach, alongside the team's work to recreate Estard and the surrounding locales to resemble handcrafted dioramas, gives the entire package a cozy and unique look. That's reflected in the cover image below, which features Prince Kiefer, Hero, and Maribel trying to avoid the gaze of a dangerous golem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the story itself, video editor Alex Van Aken and I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to visit Square Enix's new Shibuya office, play the game for a few hours, and interview the team behind it. We also interviewed a key figure of this long-running franchise for more than 90 minutes, but you'll have to wait a bit longer to hear more about that! We have plenty more to say when the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue launches digitally next month, as we'll be posting exclusive articles and videos all month long, but it's safe to say we had a great time and are looking forward to sharing more about this remake.&nbsp;</p>
