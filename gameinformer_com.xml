Then, at night, he takes his haul to a nearby sushi restaurant, where they can use his treasures to upgrade the establishment and his catches to serve the patrons. The game has received various updates in its more than two years of post-launch support, including crossovers with Godzilla and the Like a Dragon franchise.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0hGViOxcBw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0hGViOxcBw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the surprise launch of Dave the Diver on Xbox Series X/S, we also got a new look at the upcoming In The Jungle expansion, which was previously slated for a late-2025 release.
