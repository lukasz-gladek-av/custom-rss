            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/10/vampire-survivors-announces-crossover-with-square-enixs-saga-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After making waves in late 2022, the wildly popular Vampire Survivors has continued adding a ton of new and crossover content to the overall package. Developer Poncle has already added content from the likes of Castlevania, Contra, and Among Us, and now, it has struck a deal with a new publisher to include content from one of its long-running franchises. As a result, starting today, players can brave the undead hordes as characters from Square Enix's SaGa franchise.</p>

<p>Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama joins the ever-growing Poncle package today, adding characters from Square Enix's SaGa franchise, in particular, SaGa Emerald Beyond. According to Poncle, the SaGa characters can stand alongside the Vampire Survivors. This free content drop adds more than 40 new attacks, 16 playable characters and skins, and a new stage with seven distinct biomes to explore.</p>

<p>While this announcement is squarely focused on SaGa, the newly forged partnership with Square Enix (and the fact that its deal with Konami led to content from multiple franchises) hopefully leads to more collaborations with the iconic publisher, as its other franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts would also make great additions to the Vampire Survivors roster. The Emerald Dioarama expansion is available now for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS (excluding the Apple Arcade version), and Android.

This summer, players can expect a new way to play with friends, as well as the addition of a new playable character from another side-scrolling roguelite, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dead-cells/one-of-the-best-roguelikes-to-date">Dead Cells</a>.</p>

<p>While we don't have much in the way of details, during today's Triple-i Initiative stream, developer/publisher 91Act announced that a couch co-op and a free playable character from the Dead Cells universe will be arriving this summer. The Dead Cells character joins the 11 preexisting characters already in playable in the BlazBlue Entropy Effect roster. You can see the full teaser, which also serves as an accolades trailer, below.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/10/my-team-improvements-lead-the-pack</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/10/my-team-improvements-lead-the-pack<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it was introduced in 2020, the F1 series' My Team offered players a long-form way to manage a team over a career. While it became a popular option for players looking for more than just one-off races, it hasn't received many meaningful updates or upgrades since its introduction. This year brings an extensive redesign to the My Team experience while also expanding on Driver Career.</p>

<p>In what the development team at Codemasters refers to as "My Team 2.0," you control a team owner who manages two drivers simultaneously, opening up different interactions that come with that angle, like recruiting and managing your relationship day-over-day with each driver. Since you now have two drivers to manage, you must manage their perception of your team as you negotiate with them using the in-game contract system.&nbsp;Based on your performance, you earn experience for your owner, allowing you to upgrade your skills to specialize in specific areas of team management.</p>



<p>As you play through various races, you can improve your Fan Rating, the sentiment surrounding the team, based on how you perform in team versus team rivalries. In between races, you spend your time in Team HQ, which has also been upgraded for this entry. The updated facilities structure brings a more granular upgrade system and a workforce size management element where you have to balance the benefits of having a large support staff versus the cost of having so many folks on your team.</p>

<p>The team at Codemasters also split Research &amp; Development into separate systems, making it so your decisions interact with your perks and upgrades from the rest of the My Team HQ, including facility improvements and activities.&nbsp;Additionally, sponsors now operate on a loyalty and relationship-based system. As you build your relationship with a sponsor over time, you unlock benefits and new customization options. Based on your sponsors' core beliefs and backgrounds, you can experience new kinds of events within the mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Both My Team and Driver Career are receiving increased implementation of the Driver Icons, including AI teams being able to recruit Icons for the first time and the ability to enable or disable the Icons individually. Finally, both modes integrate content from Konnersport, the fictional team from F1 25's Braking Point story mode, and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>movie starring Brad Pitt. However, the&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>movie content is largely exclusive to the Iconic Edition.</p>

<p>F1 25 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on May 30. Those who pick up the Iconic Edition will receive three days of early access beginning on May 27.</p>
