            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the three-player first-person shooter from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/control">Control</a> developer Remedy Entertainment, launched back in June to middling results. Though available on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus on day one, Remedy saw players quickly drop off from the game for various reasons. Now, in <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">Remedy's latest financial results</a>, the company has acknowledged the game's "unsuccessful" launch and plans to turn things around.&nbsp;</p><p>"Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak," the financial results read. "Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/CP3ameICxSk" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CP3ameICxSk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The results go on to explain that FBC: Firebreak was designed to evolve over time and that, despite a rocky launch, Remedy believes it has built a solid foundation. "Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive â€“ showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining. We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop."&nbsp;</p><p>Remedy says looking ahead, a larger "Major Update" late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak, supported by "targeted marketing activities, which we expect will drive interest in the title."&nbsp;</p><p>"We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," Remedy's comments on FBC: Firebreak end.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/yqgJWW1iF0o" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yqgJWW1iF0o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Elsewhere in the financial results, Remedy says <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/31/remedy-provides-update-on-control-2-says-max-payne-remakes-are-in-production">Control 2's</a> development is on track to hit its next milestones, with the focus now on "the gameplay, environments, and missions." <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor">Remedy's Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake project</a> remains in full production, the studio says, and "collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase."&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/control/a-heady-power-trip"><em>Game Informer's </em>Control review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/alan-wake-2/back-to-reality"><em>Game Informer's </em>Alan Wake 2 review</a>.
