            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, a tag-team fighter from the studio behind such hits as Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive, is getting another closed beta. The first ran from September 5 to 7, and featured online play, limited offline functionality, and six playable fighters. This new closed beta, which runs from December 5 to 7, adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes) into the mix as playable characters and adds various other features to give players a better chance to test out the upcoming fighter.</p><p>This second closed beta adds Savage Land, which was revealed at Tokyo Game Show, and the X-Mansion, which was revealed today. These two iconic locales come primarily from the X-Men side of the Marvel Universe, and the X-Mansion features Colossus, Beast, Professor X, and other mutants lingering the background. The new beta will also include more consistent online play with no breaks in the gameplay schedule, rollback netcode, expanded offline features, and spectator mode.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>With the inclusion of these two new characters into this next closed beta, that brings the full roster for December's closed beta to eight characters: Captain America, Doctor Doom, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, and Storm. We do not know how many playable characters will be available in the final game, but if we look at Dragon Ball FighterZ, it included 23 playable characters at launch (including unlockables), plus another 22 post-launch, bringing the total to 45. Marvel has no shortage of well-known characters, so it stands to reason we have quite a few more to learn about in the lead up to launch and after.</p><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC at some point in 2026.
