            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>FromSoftware has announced major sales milestones for Elden Ringâ€™s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/an-emphatic-exclamation-point">Shadow of the Erdtree </a>expansion and its multiplayer spin-off, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, the well-received expansion for Elden Ring that released last June, has passed 10 million worldwide sales. Meanwhile, the cooperative roguelike spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign has surpassed 5 million units sold globally since launching on May 30.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This news comes after FromSoftware announced in April that the original Elden Ring had <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-shipped">shipped 30 million units</a> since launching in 2022. A Switch 2 port called Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is slated to launch later this year. Additionally, a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/23/elden-ring-live-action-movie-in-the-works-with-ex-machina-annihilation-director-alex">live-action film</a> directed by Alex Garland and developed by A24 is also in the works.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, the Elden Ring franchise has proven incredibly lucrative for From Software. Whether or not it will follow-up on that success with a proper sequel remains to be seen, but the developer has already announced its next action game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/the-duskbloods-from-softwares-next-game-is-a-switch-2-exclusive">The Duskbloods</a>, which launches exclusively for Switch 2 next year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/elden-ring-nightreign-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hit-major-sales-milestones]]></content:encoded>
