            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/get-a-new-look-at-the-gorgeous-shinobi-art-of-vengeance-through-a-stage-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's been more than a decade since we received an all-new Shinobi title, but thanks to Sega's recent initiative to revive dormant IPs from its deep catalog, the company is set to release Shinobi: Art of Vengeance later this year. The gorgeous revival comes from Lizardcube, the development team behind 2020's Streets of Rage 4, a franchise that was originally published by Sega.</p>

<p>This entry is the first all-new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi on 3DS. Unlike the Streets of Rage revival, which was published by Dotemu, Sega is partnering directly with Lizardcube to revitalize the Shinobi series. Late last week, Sega gave us about a minute of new gameplay, teasing the design of the stages in Shinobi: Art of Vengeance. Though the levels and encounters appear well-designed and engaging, the visual aesthetic continues to steal the show with every new glimpse at Lizardcube's next title.</p>

<p>You can view the new trailer below.</p>

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 29. Those pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition can play three days before everyone else and receive additional in-game items, including currency, a Ghost outfit, a Medic Lite Amulet, and a Sega Villains Stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ships-1-million-copies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Despite being a new IP, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is off to a strong start. It launched last week to generally rave reviews, and developer Sandfall Interactive announced it’s also performing similarly well sales-wise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The developer took to <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1916409440011444331">X</a> yesterday to reveal it shipped over 1 million copies of the hit RPG in just three days (the game launched on April 24). Though marketed primarily by Xbox, Sandfall confirms this number does not include Xbox Game Pass players, so it appears the game is also selling well across PlayStation 5 and PC. It also seems the surprise launch of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/22/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-available-today">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> days earlier has not hindered the game’s success.&nbsp;</p>

One million copies sold.</p><p>

Thank you for believing in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. <a href="https://t.co/92T2qZxcHP">pic.twitter.com/92T2qZxcHP</a></p></div>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the debut title for French developer Sandfall Interactive and has garnered critical acclaim. It currently sits at a 92 critical score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Metacritic</a>; we awarded it a 9 out of 10 in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33/melancholy-rpg-eminence">our review</a>. The adventure follows an expedition of adventurers on a mission to stop a mysterious paintress with the power to wipe out humans of a certain age every year. It boasts fast-paced turn-based action bolstered by third-person action elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As editor Kyle Hilliard noted in his review, “The world, art, and narrative are unique, but it makes me nostalgic for a game I remember from the past. It’s as though developer Sandfall Interactive managed to make a classic RPG with only the good parts. I’m sad in a way to have concluded the journey, but the adventure to pursue the Paintress will linger with me for some time.”</p>
