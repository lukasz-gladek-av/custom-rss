            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gamescom 2025 was officially the biggest and most diverse in show history, according to the association that organizes the annual event in Cologne, Germany. Bringing in nearly 400,000 visitors from more than 100 countries, with international participation at an all-time high and its digital reach breaking a new record, <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/2025-excites-the-community-worldwide-and-sets-new-standards">the association is calling it the most successful show yet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Having spent a week in Cologne to cover the show for <em>Game Informer</em>, it was both one of the most exhausting and exciting weeks of my career. I played so many amazing games, spoke to just as many interesting devs, and ultimately, came away from the show excited about the future of gaming, despite the industry's many, many problems. It turns out, I was one of 357,000 visitors from 128 countries at the show this year. More than 34,000 trade visitors attended the show, and Gamescom saw the strongest growth in this sector from the U.S., China, Canada, and Japan.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3y4kS24z2yQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3y4kS24z2yQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Speaking of international participation, a total of 1,568 exhibitors from 72 countries participated on the show floor, "with a foreign share of 70%," according to a press release. "There were also 40 country pavilions representing 35 countries, including for the first time the pavilion of official partner country Thailand, along with Dubai and Kyrgyzstan."</p><p>Digitally, Gamescom 2025 reached new heights, too, garnering over 630 million views worldwide as of this past Saturday evening (Gamescom's final day was yesterday). Gamescom says that's a 105 percent increase compared to last year's show. Seventy-two million of those views were for Gamescom's Opening Night Live last Tuesday, marking an 80 percent increase in viewership compared to last year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gamescom combines business and entertainment like no other event worldwide, as shown by 1,568 exhibitors spread across 233,000 square meters of gross exhibition space," Koelnmesse (the event hall) president and CEO Gerald Böse writes in a press release. "With record figures once again in nearly every category, the enormous variety of experiences and global participation, Gamescom is the most important event for the global gaming community."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4xQ-u2PyiU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h3>Here are Gamescom 2025 stats, at a glance:&nbsp;</h3><ul><li><p>357,000&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;from 128 countries</p></li><li><p>Over 34,000 trade visitors, with the strongest growth from the US, China,&nbsp;Canada, and Japan</p></li><li><p>More than&nbsp;630 million views across the entire show program (as of Saturday evening) – an increase of 105 percent over the previous year</p></li><li><p>72 million views for Gamescom Opening Night Live (as of Saturday evening) – an increase of 80 percent over the previous year</p></li><li><p>5.7 million page views for Gamescom&nbsp;Epix (as of Saturday evening)</p></li><li><p>1,568 exhibitors from 72 countries, with a foreign share of 70 percent</p></li><li><p>40&nbsp;country&nbsp;pavilions&nbsp;from 35 countries</p></li><li><p>Approximately 233,000 square meters of gross exhibition space</p></li><li><p>Around 80,000 people at the Gamescom city festival</p></li></ul><p>We have a ton of coverage for Gamescom 2025 up on the <em>Game Informer </em>site, with many more previews for upcoming games to come, so check out some of the pieces so far:&nbsp;</p><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><hr><p><em>What was your favorite game shown during Gamescom 2025?
