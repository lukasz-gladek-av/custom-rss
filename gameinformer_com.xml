            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Goooooooooood morning! It's the day after Christmas for those who celebrate, and you're probably either back to work or chilling at home, enjoying the gifts you received this year. Or maybe you're still in a food-induced coma. Regardless, the holiday season is coming to a close, and the big man dressed in red is back home at the North Pole.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, Christmas (which is always my favorite holiday of the year) was extra special – it was the first one with my almost-9-months-old daughter, and though she basically had zero idea what was going on, it still made for some memories I'll forever cherish. I didn't buy her any video game gifts this year – that'll come in due time – but my wife and I did get her some climbing blocks and a large hexagonal activity cube, with which my daughter completely ignores the abundance of fun interactive activities on it to... also climb it. My daughter is at the age where she's pulling herself up to stand and so anything and everything she can climb on, she loves, which is to say my wife and I crushed it this year.&nbsp;</p><p>But in lieu of my not purchasing any video game-related gifts this Christmas, I want to know: what video game gifts did you give or receive this Christmas? It can be games, consoles, merch, ornaments – anything! I wanna know!</p><p>Drop a line in the comments below and share the splendors of your Christmas!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/reader-discussion/2025/12/26/reader-discussion-what-video-game-gifts-did-you-get-for-christmas]]></content:encoded>
