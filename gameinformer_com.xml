Plus, the team announced that Silksong has sold more than seven million copies, noting that this number doesn't include the "millions more" playing it via Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p><p>That's an exciting update from Team Cherry as the developer looks to close out the year, but it also announced that it's working on a Nintendo Switch 2 edition of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> that will launch in 2026 and be free to all owners of Hollow Knight on Nintendo Switch. "Hollow Knight Nintendo Switch 2 Edition incorporates all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: High frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects," a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">blog post</a> reads.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow teaser below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDFEeeLy6ws"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDFEeeLy6ws" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Additionally, Team Cherry says it is updating all versions of the original Hollow Knight for current platforms, adding features and fixing bugs, with PC players able to experience many of these updates right now via public beta branches. "That includes full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support for those of you with Steam Decks or ultrawide monitors," the post reads. You can read the complete list of fixes <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Team Cherry's end-of-year update includes details on&nbsp;<a href="https://fanga.me/r/silksong-figs" target="_blank">new Silksong mini figs available for preorder </a><a href="https://fanga.me/r/silksong-figs">now</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Beyond Fangamer's excellent items, the Hollow Knight games will also be popping up in various sales across the holiday break," the post concludes. "Keep an eye out to grab a discounted copy, whether that's for a friend, a family member, or for yourself. That's it! But for a tiny team, that feels like a lot! And we've even more plans for 2026 that we're keeping under wraps. For now, though, Team Cherry will be taking a few weeks to rest and prepare before the big year to come."&nbsp;</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong – Sea of Sorrow hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hollow-knight-silksong/punishing-grandeur"><em>Game Informer's </em>Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/05/the-top-10-nintendo-switch-2-games"><em>Game Informer's </em>list of the top 10 Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>.
