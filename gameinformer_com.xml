The team describes it as “League of Legends meets Rocket League,” and players will get the first chance to check it out during a Steam Next Fest demo from Monday, June 9, through Monday, June 16.</p><p>Players who hop into the demo will receive an exclusive cosmetic skin to use in the full game. If you’re curious about how Sparkball plays, check out the Steam Next Fest gameplay trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJ3t_1i7rZM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJ3t_1i7rZM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Sparkball pits two teams of four against each other in matches where players “brawl, block, and score in a futuristic arena,” according to a press release. Players will embrace roles like strategist or “mechanical mastermind” to bring their team to victory and possibly secure the title of MVP.</p><p>Opti Games says Sparkball aims to reward and celebrate versatility as players don’t need to be good at scoring if they’re good at brawling with the enemy team, and vice versa. “Whether blocking shots, setting up plays, scoring goals, or simply out-dueling your opponent, there’s something to love for every type of gamer,” it says.</p><p>The Sparkball Steam Next Fest demo will be available on PC and Steam Deck starting next week on Monday, June 9. You’ll have until Monday, June 16, to hop in and obtain the exclusive skin.</p><p>There’s no release date announced yet, but Opti Games says Sparkball is due out in Q4 of 2025. In the meantime, check out the screenshots below:</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out Sparkball during Steam Next Fest?
