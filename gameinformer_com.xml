            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has announced it will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers service in January. The program launched in 2019 and allowed users to purchase a pair of digital tickets that could be redeemed on two select digital Switch games, usually at a cheaper overall price than if they were bought traditionally.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html">FAQ page</a> on the matter states that vouchers will remain available for purchase until January 30, 2026. Purchased vouchers are valid for one year (365 days) from the date of purchase. So even if you buy vouchers on the final day they're available, they will still be usable until January 30, 2027.</p><p>New Switch games will continue to be added to the list of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0">eligible Game Voucher titles</a>, even after January 30, Nintendo confirms. This means those who own vouchers past the cutoff date can still expect to have new games to redeem them for â€“ and you probably should use them, as purchased vouchers cannot be refunded.</p><p>Game Vouchers cost $99.98, and since they can be redeemed for two full-priced games (usually at $59.99), customers could save a decent bit of money. They are only eligible for Switch 1 games, including The Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">Tears of the Kingdom</a>/<a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild/b/switch/archive/2017/03/02/game-informer-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.aspx">Breath of the Wild</a>/<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/pulled-in-two-directions">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pikmin-4/mans-best-friends">Pikmin 4</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/getting-its-flowers">Super Mario Bros.
