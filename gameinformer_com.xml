            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Hideo Kojima's studio, Kojima Productions, has released a new teaser trailer for its in-development horror game, OD. It features Sophia Lillis (<em>It, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>) lighting some strange, seemingly ritualistic candles while an ominous knock sound echoes throughout the mostly empty apartment.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">Kojima first revealed OD way back in 2023</a> by bringing out acclaimed <em>Get Out</em>, <em>Us</em>, and <em>Nope </em>director Jordan Peele on stage during The Game Awards that year. The two indicated that they were working on a cloud-based horror project called OD for Xbox Game Studios, which would feature Lillis and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>). However, this game, which Kojima has confirmed is called OD – Knock, might differ from whatever Peele is working on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the OD – Knock teaser trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, OD – Knock appears to be the game teased during The Game Awards in 2023 as both feature Lillis. However, during today's <a href="https://youtu.be/P6CaAu3T7l0?si=ToMsuM-lUa86Xjp-">Kojima Productions: Beyond The Strand event</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od"><em>IGN</em></a>, Kojima said, "There is a different kind of fear [Peele] will do. Mine is the knock."&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that OD will be a series of projects focused on different fears. Kojima said during the livestream that he is afraid of large knocking sounds, and perhaps that's why his OD project is subtitled "Knock." We'll have to wait to see what fear Peele's OD project tackles.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima Productions is developing OD – Knock in collaboration with Xbox Game Studios, though it's unclear if Xbox is publishing the game as an exclusive or just lending a hand with the cloud technology the game(s) will use.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">check out the first OD teaser</a>, and then read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/boundless-sincerity-aside-flaws">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding/death-stranding-review-the-wanderer">Death Stranding</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What fear do you want Jordan Peele's OD project to tackle? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/23/od-knock-teaser-trailer-from-kojima-productions-features-first-person-horror]]></content:encoded>
