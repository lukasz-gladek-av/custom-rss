            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/baldurs-gate-3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-announces-new-divinity-game">Larian Studios revealed Divinity</a>, a new game in its long-running Divinity series that includes 2017's Divinity: Original Sin II, during The Game Awards 2025 earlier this month. Though we all assumed it, Larian has since confirmed that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/divinity">Divinity</a> will be a turn-based RPG in a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Larian founder, CEO, and creative director Swen Vincke called the game a "turn-based RPG," quelling any fears the studio would be experimenting outside of its bread and butter. That said, Vincke also teased the game's massive scale.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is going to be us unleashed, I think," Vincke told <em>Bloomberg</em>. "It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level." That lines up with what The Game Awards 2025 host Geoff Keighley said on stage following the game's reveal, where he called it Larian's biggest game ever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Watch the Divinity cinematic reveal trailer below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxzyVeAG00w?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxzyVeAG00w?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For the uninitiated, Divinity is an original series created by Larian that began with Divine Divinity in 2002 and continued with 2004's Beyond Divinity, 2009's Divinity II, 2014's Divinity: Original Sin, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/divinity-original-sin-2">2017's Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, which launched yesterday <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-surprise-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2-today">on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2</a>. That said, as you might know, despite success in its original Divinity series, it was 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 that propelled Larian to new (and successful) heights.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Baldur's Gate 3 wasn't an original IP – it's owned by Wizards of the Coast, the maker of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic: The Gathering. In 2024, Vincke revealed <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new">the studio is done with Baldur's Gate 3 to focus on something new</a> (presumably Divinity), adding that Larian is not returning to the Baldur's Gate franchise for its next game.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no release date for Divinity in sight, but Vincke tells <em>Bloomberg that </em>Larian plans to do an early access release before its 1.0 launch.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/baldurs-gate-3/a-true-soul-stirrer"><em>Game Informer's </em>Baldur's Gate 3 review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2/a-godly-ascension"><em>Game Informer's </em>Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em><strong>Bloomberg</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p><hr><p><em>Are you excited for Divinity, or would you have preferred Larian make another Baldur's Gate game?
