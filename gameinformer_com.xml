            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/09/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-delayed-by-a-few-weeks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo revealed that its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/nintendos-day-old-app-reveals-the-release-date-for-the-live-action-zelda-movie">live-action Legend of Zelda film</a> would hit theaters on March 27, 2027. Now, the company has delayed its release date by a few weeks, to May 7, 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>The company revealed this with a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075229901451445">post</a> on X from Shigeru Miyamoto citing "production reasons" and the need for extra time. It's a short delay—roughly five weeks—but a delay nonetheless, meaning you'll have to wait a little bit longer to see how Nintendo adapts one of its most popular franchises.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/txYZoQtXPxM?si=AmbYZ0BiOhhY2-iy" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txYZoQtXPxM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This is Miyamoto," a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1932075231885382103">post</a> on X from the official Nintendo account reads. "For production reasons, we are changing <span>the release date of the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda to May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be. Thank you for your patience."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though we know this movie is happening, we have no idea who its stars will be, what Zelda storyline it will adapt (if any), who the villain will be, or virtually anything else. Fortunately, with nearly two years until its release, there's still plenty of time to learn more about what Nintendo has in store for its first live-action video game adaptation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, read </span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights"><em><span>Game Informer's </span></em><span>review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></a><span>, and then check out </span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/pulled-in-two-directions"><span>our thoughts on The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><hr><p><em>Who do you hope is cast as Zelda and Link in this movie?
