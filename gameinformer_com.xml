            <div property="schema:text"><p>The <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/six-one-indie-showcase-returns-next-week-with-48-games-including-mouse-pi-for-hire-and">Six One Indie Showcase</a> just wrapped, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase">highlighting more than 40 rad indie games</a> with world premieres, exclusive reveals, and more. It was this year’s best indie game showcase and one of my favorites ever, which is why it’s exciting to see the team behind it announce its new publishing arm: Six One Publishing.</p><p>Coming from the Six One Indie team, Six One Publishing was “created for developers who need an impactful partner to help them cross the finish line.” The team describes itself as an “integrated, indie-first platform” that aims to reimagine what publishing can look like in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>“We’re here to blur the lines,” Six One Publishing creative director Mike Towndrow writes in a press release. “The number of games hitting the market grows by the day, but unfortunately, the people to cover and amplify them seem to dwindle just as fast. Six One Indie has evolved into an ecosystem that can now offer a unique opportunity to get indies in front of players through fresh, unconventional means.”</p><p>Six One Publishing says working with it means “gaining direct access to every part of the Six One ecosystem – from original video content and editorials to our growing slate of indie showcases and creator collabs. By fusing the best parts of publishing, media, and community into one agile framework, we’re rewriting the rulebook to serve developers – not shareholders.”</p><p>Towndrow concludes the press release by stating he believes indies "deserve a major push backed by authenticity, genuine enthusiasm, and a new approach for an unpredictable industry.”</p><p>If you want an idea of the types of indies Six One Indie wants to get eyes on, look no further than <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase"><em>Game Informer’s</em> round-up of every game shown during today’s Six One Indie Showcase</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>
