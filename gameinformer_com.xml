            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Summerfall Studios (a developer founded in part by Dragon Age writer David Gaider) made its debut with Stray Gods, a musical game starring modern-day adaptations of the ancient Greek pantheon. Its next game, Malys, is a massive departure in both tone and gameplay. Earlier this April, Summerfall announced a Kickstarter for this new project, but unfortunately, it failed to reach its funding goal. However, the game still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3449690/view/525346350588493892?l=english">entered early access this past June</a>, and now, just a few months later, <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">it's hitting 1.0</a>, launching on Steam on October 24.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdOC7dwPUzM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdOC7dwPUzM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This deckbuilder tells the story of Noah, a demon hunter, on his quest to slay the Malys, an evil creature with the city in a chokehold. The game's combat encounters are exorcisms, and you'll play and burn cards in order to expose demons' true names and expel them from their hosts. According to <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">a blogpost on Summerfall's website</a>, the 1.0 update will also include "cloud saves, a fully playable story, all three regions and the final boss fight, as well as a full scale music update across the game."</p><p>The blog post also mentions that the price will increase slightly at launch, so if you're interested in grabbing it cheaper (it's currently $9.99 in the US), make sure to do so before October 24.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/malys-a-deckbuilder-from-the-stray-gods-team-enters-10-later-this-month]]></content:encoded>
