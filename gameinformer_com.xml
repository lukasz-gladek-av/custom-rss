Revealed during The Game Awards 2025, Coven of the Chicken Foot is described by the studio as "a single-player adventure about the bonding of an old witch and a peculiar creature as they attempt to fulfill a coven's oath."&nbsp;</p><p>In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the game's unique companion-based gameplay where Gertie, the elderly witch, must work with an oddball creature to solve puzzles, overcome challenges, and platform through this vibrant world.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/mRNAbGYwvgg?si=ocThWpu1n8bJaRal" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRNAbGYwvgg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Wildflower says your "creature-companion can observe, learn, and develop new behaviors based on contextual situations," but adds that the creature is a fully realized character with their own motivations, surprises, and interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The dungeons have been plundered and the monsters long slain," a press release reads. "As heroes move on, an elderly witch quietly gets to work. Gertie has long awaited her moment to prove herself to the coven. Having pledged to counter the so-called 'heroes' and their unbridled pride, she'll require the assistance of an odd creature."</p><p>Coven of the Chicken Foot will see players, as Gertie, venture into dark dungeons, lush forests, catacombs of fallen heroes, mucky bogs, and more, a press release says, but she's not your typical hero. "She won't be swinging swords or double-jumping her way past dangers," it continues. "Instead, she must learn to work with and adapt to her peculiar companion to survive."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;While Gertie talks and the creature makes noises, Wildflower Interactive says these two adventurers intentionally do not share a common tongue, adding, "Players are driven to discover the creature's true intentions themselves" and that "through environmental storytelling, [we] let the world itself reveal the narrative, inviting players to discover the story firsthand."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Get another look at Coven of the Chicken Foot with the screenshots below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coven of the Chicken Foot is in development for PC, but there's no word on when the game will launch.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think about this game's reveal? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/the-last-of-us-co-creator-bruce-straleys-next-game-is-a-witchy]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After an initial performance and some awards being handed out, tonight’s Game Awards presentation got its reveals underway with a beautiful cinematic trailer revealing Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic.</p><p>The new single-player RPG is set during the Old Republic era, and is directed by Casey Hudson, working as part of Arcanaut Studios. Hudson is well known to RPG fans from his work leading games like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect.</p><p>While the new trailer looks great, it doesn’t reveal much. We see a spaceship descend onto a mysterious and desolate planet, a female lead venturing forth with two companions, and a fateful encounter with someone or something bathed in red light.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAmkl1jL0fo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAmkl1jL0fo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The whole thing has a very Star Wars feel, but we’ll have to wait to learn more about what’s really going on.</p><p>Even without more info, Fate of the Old Republic is a hugely exciting project. After years of fan requests for more single-player Star Wars RPGs, having Hudson in place to bring us another game is big news indeed.</p><p>No word yet on platform availability or release date, but rest assured, to borrow phrasing from a certain emperor, we’ll be watching the development of the game with great interest.&nbsp;</p>
