<p><strong>Here's a look at all of Timmy Turner's abilities in Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Elemental Wall </strong>– Summons a random elemental wall of Fire, Lightning, or Ice that deals damage and knocks enemies backward with a satisfying poof.</li><li><strong>Mushroom Rain</strong> – Opens a sparkly portal that drops enchanted mushrooms from the sky. Each one smacks enemies for damage and randomly applies poison, burn, or freeze them.</li><li><strong>Vacuum Ball </strong>– A vacuum that slowly siphons energy from enemies as it pulls them inward, dealing damage with each tick. Enemies below 20% HP are instantly absorbed into the swirling core, forming the Vacuum Ball. Once charged, it can be hurled at enemies, dealing attack damage.</li><li><strong>Piñata’s Revenge</strong> – A totally cursed piñata taunts nearby enemies into attacking it. While it’s up, your hits grant random buffs, and enemy hits cause random debuffs. After a few seconds… KABOOM. Candy and damage for everyone in range.</li><li><strong>A Really Dangerous Weapon</strong> – Drops a magical cannon that fires a barrage of magical cannonballs. Hits enemies with rapid-fire blasts of damage. Nobody's quite sure where Timmy got it. Definitely not approved by Da Rules.</li><li><strong>Scepter Beam</strong> – Unleashes a crackling elemental ray that cycles between Fire, Lightning, and Ice. Each second brings a new element and a fresh debuff. Zapping enemies restores mana.</li><li><strong>Spiky Ball</strong> – Summons a giant, glittery spiked ball that bounces three times before exploding. Or press skill button again to blow it up early. Each bounce deals damage. Each explosion? Spectacular. Just don’t ask who tested it.</li></ul><p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store sometime this Fall.</p><hr><p><em>What character do you want to see revealed for Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny?
