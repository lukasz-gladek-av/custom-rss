            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/mixtape-is-a-sharp-looking-coming-of-age-story-with-music-from-devo">Mixtape</a>, the coming-of-age adventure by the creators of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-artful-escape/the-artful-escape-review-a-rocking-space-oddity">The Artful Escape</a>, has been delayed to 2026. First revealed during the 2024 Xbox Showcase, the game was slated to launch sometime this year.</p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mixtapegame.bsky.social/post/3m5cpiizcqc2h">social media post</a>, developer Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur states that Mixtape is “almost complete” and implies it's largely just applying finishing touches. The studio didn’t narrow the release window beyond the year, however, so we’ll have to stay tuned to see if the game arrives sooner than later.</p><p>Here is Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur’s full statement:</p><p>While developing Artful Escape, our 3D artist Mikey, made an oven asset. It was a nice oven - the work of a true pro. He even put the knobs on. And that’s who we are at Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur. We put the knobs on. Mixtape is almost complete, we’re just putting the knobs on. See you in 2026.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mixtape is published by Annapurna Interactive and takes place in the 1990s, centering on teenager Stacy Rockford, who dreams of becoming a music supervisor in Hollywood. She has a passion for creating mixtapes, and the story follows her and her teenage friends as they embark on a final adventure together. The game primarily consists of playable vignettes as the teens recall cherished memories, which often unfold as exaggerated takes on these events, accompanied by fourth-wall-breaking narration. The game’s presentation features a stop-motion-inspired animation reminiscent of the Spider-Verse films, and the soundtrack boasts tracks from artists including Guns &amp; Roses, DEVO, The Smashing Pumpkins, Roxy Music, Iggy Pop, Joy Division, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>We played Mixtape during Summer Game Fest this year, and it became one of our favorite demos at the show. You can read our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/13/one-of-sgfs-greatest-hits">full preview here</a>. Mixtape is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p>To read about other big delays, check out these news stories on the recent delays of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delayed-to-november-2026">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/06/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-date-delayed-beyond-early-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/11/mixtape-the-90s-coming-of-age-adventure-by-the-creators-of-the-artful-escape-delayed-to]]></content:encoded>
