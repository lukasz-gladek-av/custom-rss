            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Larian Studios has released Hoxfix 34 for Baldur's Gate 3, and it brings with it a native Steam Deck build of the game. The team says this build should feature better framerate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>Before today's hotfix, Baldur's Gate 3 ran decently on Steam Deck via a Proton build, but it came with some noticeable drawbacks, like a sometimes-unstable framerate and fuzzy resolution. Though we haven't tested it ourselves, it sounds like Larian's new native Steam Deck build will be the best way to play Baldur's Gate 3 on the go moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpAGlgJMYLc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpAGlgJMYLc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This is not just good news for Steam Deck users either," the hotfix notes read." The work the team has put into this build also means that everyone will get to enjoy overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3."</p><p>Elsewhere in the notes, Larian has addressed various questions players might have about their saves and other aspects of transitioning to this new native build. Head <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278">here</a> for more on that.
