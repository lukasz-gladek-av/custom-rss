            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation is hosting a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/psa/2026/02/09/state-of-play-announced-for-this-week-will-feature-over-an-hour-of-third-party-indie">State of Play tomorrow that will feature more than an hour of third-party, indie, and first-party games</a>. While it's likely we'll see Housemarque's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/saros">Saros</a>, considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026">it launches in April</a>, there's one PlayStation 5-exclusive we probably won't hear more about. That game is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a> – when someone on <a href="https://x.com/LukasBoii/status/2021332508688908790?s=20">X</a> asked the official Insomniac Games account when the studio would release more information about the game, Insomniac responded with, "Spring 2026."&nbsp;</p><p>This is a bit surprising as tomorrow's State of Play is one of the longest in recent years, with promised updates about PlayStation's first-party output. With Marvel's Wolverine due out sometime this year, you'd think this State of Play would be a great spot to highlight the game once more. But, it sounds like Insomniac won't be ready to do so until this Spring (which, for reference, begins March 20 in the U.S., where the studio is based).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the meantime, get refreshed on how the game is shaping up in the latest Marvel's Wolverine gameplay trailer:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's still a chance Marvel's Wolverine could appear during tomorrow's State of Play, perhaps as a surprise, but temper your expectations.
