            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/15/life-is-strange-livestream-will-reveal-a-new-game-launching-this-year">teasing the next Life is Strange game</a> last week, a special livestream that aired this afternoon revealed the next entry is called Life is Strange: Reunion. Max Caulfield returns yet again, alongside her original BFF and fan favorite character, Chloe Price.</p><p>Developed by Deck Nine, Reunion is a direct follow-up to 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure. Set once again in Caledon University, the school has been mysteriously set ablaze. Although Max manages to escape the fire thanks to her time rewind power (which makes its full return), all of her friends, the students, and the faculty are killed.</p><p>Max avoids this fate by jumping back in time through a selfie and has three days to uncover how the fire started to prevent the school's destruction. However, due to Max’s reality-shifting actions during the events of Double Exposure (which we won’t spoil), Chloe appears at Caledon University. She’s understandably confused and haunted by memories of a past she never lived, and needs Max’s help.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrxm00_0jPE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrxm00_0jPE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Players switch between controlling Max and Chloe in Reunion, offering two perspectives on the story. Max can use her rewind power to redo decisions and manipulate the environment to solve four-dimensional puzzles. Chloe (voiced once again by Rhianna DeVries) has her Backtalk dialogue mechanic from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange_before_the_storm/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/07/life-is-strange-before-the-storm-complete-review.aspx">Life is Strange: Before the Storm</a>, channeling her quick wits and attitude to steer conversations in ways Max can’t, which will let Chloe access information and areas her bestie couldn’t. Regardless of how the story shakes out, Deck Nine bills Reunion as the big conclusion to Max and Chloe's story.&nbsp;</p><p>Life is Strange: Reunion is launching on March 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. In addition to a $39.99 Standard Edition, the game will be available in three special editions, one of which is a bundle that contains Double Exposure.
