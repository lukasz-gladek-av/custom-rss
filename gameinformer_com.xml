            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Since launching in May, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, the multiplayer roguelike spinoff of Elden Ring, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">has continued to receive updates</a> introducing new bosses and more. Now, developer From Software has announced the game's biggest update yet – Deep of Night – will go live next month on Thursday, September 11.&nbsp;</p><p>Deep of Night is a "high-difficulty" Expedition challenge mode "designed for seasoned players who have navigated through the Night many times," the studio writes in a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared">press release</a>, suggesting this already-difficult game is going to get a lot harder soon. In Deep of Night, the enemies are stronger than usual. Plus, you cannot specify the target Nightlord for the Expedition, meaning the final boss of the run will be random.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Alongside this, From Software says ongoing terrain changes will not be reflected, and that special items such as "Depth Relics," which are exclusive to Deep of Night, and weapons with multiple additional but also detrimental effects, will appear on runs. Furthermore, the difficulty increases the deeper you descend, and "the ratings will fluctuate based on wins and losses, affecting the depth."&nbsp;</p><p>From Software says players should aim to surpass Depth 3, and notes that Depth 4 to Depth 5 will "feature an endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills," suggesting that Deep of Night can turn into an endless-run mode.&nbsp;</p><p>The Deep of Night update for Elden Ring Nightreign goes live on Thursday, September 11.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer's </em>Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-an-endless-high-difficulty-expedition-mode]]></content:encoded>
