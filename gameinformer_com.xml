            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>1000xResist was one of the most critically acclaimed games of 2024, and the post-apocalyptic narrative adventure is heading to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) on November 4.</p><p>The game is the debut title from indie developer Sunset Visitor and was first launched on PC and Switch on May 9, 2024. Set 1000 years in the future, humanity has largely been wiped out by a disease spread by a mysterious alien race. The remaining survivors live in an underground city led by a figure called the Allmother; players control Iris, a “Watcher” who serves the Allmother alongside her six “Sisters”, the society’s leading members, each bearing specific roles. When Iris uncovers a secret that challenges everything she’s been taught by the Allmother, she must defy to get to the bottom of a conspiracy spanning generations.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odxmZdBFIDM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odxmZdBFIDM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The largely narrative-based game was acclaimed for its storytelling, themes, and characters, winning a Peabody award for Interactive &amp; Immersive Work and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/every-winner-at-the-2025-gdc-awards">GDC 2025</a> nominations for Best Narrative, Best Debut, and the Social Impact Award.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em> scored 1000xResist a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/1000xresist/a-game-that-will-remain-and-remain">9.5 out of 10 in our review</a>, and it placed 6th on our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/20/game-informers-belated-top-10-games-of-2024-awards">Top 10 Games of 2024</a>. In his review, editor Charles Harte writes,&nbsp;</p><p>“It's hard to do 1000xResist justice by describing its basic attributes. Its intricate worldbuilding seems convoluted, its simple gameplay seems boring, and its ambition to tackle so many heavy narrative themes seems like developer Sunset Visitor is biting off more than it can chew. But the magic of 1000xResist is not in what the game sets out to accomplish; it's in the fact that it does so with jaw-dropping finesse. The world and its characters are unique and fascinating, the basic gameplay leaves room for thousands of lines of brilliant dialogue, and the themes are explored in ways that have reshaped the way I think about stories and their impact on the modern world. Despite minor flaws, 1000xResist has firmly established itself as one of the most groundbreaking stories in video game history."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/acclaimed-narrative-adventure-1000xresist-heads-to-playstation-and-xbox-next-month]]></content:encoded>
