            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Slay the Spire is a fantastic game, ushering the rise in popularity of both roguelikes and deckbuilders, so it's always exciting to get more news about what developer Mega Crit plans to do with the sequel. While we knew Slay The Spire 2 was slated to release in Early Access sometime next month, a new trailer revealed Mega Crit's plans to drop it on March 5, just two weeks from today. You can take a look at the trailer, which includes animation and new gameplay footage, below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PW22jwFNxU8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PW22jwFNxU8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the release date, Mega Crit also announced Slay the Spire 2 will have a massive feature not included in the predecessor: co-op play. Up to four people will be able to play alongside one another in a new dedicated mode, which features "multiplayer-specific cards" and "powerful team synergies," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english">according to a recent update to the game's Steam page</a>.</p><p>The trailer also shows off two new characters coming to the Early Access launch (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/577148613051810005?l=english">the Necrobinder</a> and the Regent), and reveals that the Defect, one of the playable characters from the first game, is returning. This means the game's playable roster, which has five characters when you include the Ironclad and the Silent, only excludes the Watcher. That said, given that this is still the Early Access period, there's plenty of time for them to reappear.</p><p>Slay the Spire 2 launches into Early Access on March 5. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond">We recently included it in our massive feature on our most anticipated games of 2026</a>, so it's safe to say we're excited about it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/19/slay-the-spire-2-reveals-4-player-co-op-march-early-access-release-date]]></content:encoded>
