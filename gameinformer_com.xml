            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today’s State of Play offered some fresh looks at a number of games, but one of the most exciting appearances was for Insomniac’s hotly antipated Wolverine game. The newly revealed trailer offers plenty of action to sink one’s claws into, and also hints heavily at some of the characters and locations that will play a central role.</p><p>The development studio that brought us the Marvel's Spider-Man games is clearly taking a very different direction with Wolverine as it relates to mature content. Specifically, Wolverine is, without a doubt, an M-rated title that includes some extreme levels of brutal violence. Logan is seen throughout the video using his claws to dismember, stab, and otherwise eviscerate his foes, and it’s clear that Insomniac has invested heavily in creating believable tech around the battles, including the lifelike appearance of blood.</p><p>Evidently, the mutant warrior will be taking on a globe-trotting adventure, as we see locations as far-flung as a Japanese cityscape, the wilds of Canada, and the mysterious land of Madripoor – a fictional mainstay of Wolverine adventures in the comic books. We also see several familiar faces show up, including the likes of Omega Red and Mystique.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After revealing the trailer, Insomniac introduced us to the man who’ll be voicing Wolverine this time around. Liam McIntyre is set to bring Logan’s gruff but emotionally fraught persona to your gaming screen. McIntyre is best known for his work on the <em>Spartacus</em> TV series, but he also has video game experience, having played JD Fenix in Gears of War 4 and 5. He’s also done voice work in various animated properties.</p><p>Marvel’s Wolverine is still a good way off from its release on PlayStation 5 in the fall of 2026, roughly a year from now. However, Insomniac made a point to call out plans to share more about the game this spring. Until then, we’ll all have to be the best there is at what we do: waiting for more details.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the full trailer above, and a breakdown of what was shown in the "Behind the Claws" video below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oBib2xkYfE4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oBib2xkYfE4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-comes-out-swinging-in-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In recent years, PlayStation has begun porting its precious exclusives to PC, and today, they revealed a peripheral that will theoretically enhance that experience: a pair of PlayStation-branded speakers. You can watch the Pulse Elevate speakers reveal trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgn9VHKFDd0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgn9VHKFDd0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As the footage says, the speakers use Bluetooth, connecting to a PC or Mac using a USB-C dongle. They can also pair to a PlayStation Portal, presumably without a dongle, if you want to use them instead of the handheld's built-in speakers. The speakers are also able to make use of 3D audio if you're playing a PlayStation game that includes it as an optional feature. And like the DualSense, it also comes with a built-in mic with noise canceling, to allow you to voice chat while the game is playing.</p><p>It's a bit of an odd product, to be honest – it's unlikely that people with gaming-capable PCs don't have speakers already, and it's quite a purchase to bring with a handheld like the Portal. With the rising costs of gaming hardware, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/sony-is-raising-the-price-of-every-playstation-5-model-tomorrow-august-21">including PlayStation's increases from August</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/19/xbox-console-prices-will-increase-again-next-month">Xbox's increases announced just last week</a>, we're curious to see how much these speakers eventually retail for, though the price has yet to be revealed.</p><p>The speakers will hit shelves some time next year in black and white models.
