            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it will publish an unannounced cooperative shooter in development at JJ Abrams' Bad Robot Games studio. The unannounced game is a "four-player, cooperative shooter" that's being directed by Left 4 Dead creator and designer Mike Booth, and it's set to launch on PlayStation 5 and PC sometime in the future.</p><p>JJ Abrams announced in 2018 that his film production company, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/06/07/jj-abrams-production-company-expands-to-bad-robot-games">Bad Robot, was expanding to create a video game studio called Bad Robot Games</a>. At the time, Bad Robot Games entered into a partnership with Chinese conglomerate Tencent for the venture, with Mortal Kombat publisher WB Games involved as a minority stakeholder, but it's unclear if those two companies are involved in this Booth-directed game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game," vice president and head of SIE 2P/3P Content Ventures and Strategic Initiatives Christian Svensson writes in a press release. "Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE's mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players. We can't wait for gamers to step into the world they've been building."&nbsp;</p><p>Bad Robot Games is a division of Bad Robot, which is a movie production company behind the Mission: Impossible series, the Star Wars sequels, the 2010s Star Trek movies, and more. It is "a dedicated game studio working on new and existing transmedia franchises" and is fully remote.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to see of Booth's cooperative shooter game?
