            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo and Lego have become regular collaborators in recent years. Between its Lego Mario line of toys and more recent models like an NES or Bowser, the Nintendo-specific Lego sets are plentiful enough that they take up huge sections of the aisle in toy stores. Today, the two announced their latest collaboration: a replica of Nintendo's first handheld, the Game Boy.</p><p>The set is aimed towards nostalgic adults, coming with an 18+ age recommendation. It doesn't light up, and it's (perhaps obviously) not a playable system, but the buttons are designed to be pressed, with a realistic tactile feel. The model comes with two game cartridges – Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening – which can be inserted just as you would into the real handheld. It also comes with swappable screens to simulate each game, along with a third option showing the Nintendo logo.</p><p>Take a look for yourself at the photo gallery below.</p><p>The Lego set will retail for $59.99 in the United States. It launches October 1 of this year, but you can preorder one at regular Lego retailers (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=ignlego-20&amp;ascsubtag=070hgOr7WJvqG6SJWg1FAAQ">Amazon</a>) starting today.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/a-lego-game-boy-replica-comes-out-this-october]]></content:encoded>
