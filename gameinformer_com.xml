            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the cat-breeding roguelike turn-based strategy RPG, has already made back its 8-year development costs, and it only took about three hours after the game's launch to do so. That's according to developer Tyler Glaiel in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot"><em>IGN</em></a>, who told the publication, "So far, this is beating expectations by quite a lot." Glaiel, who developed the game with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> creator Edmund McMillen, says Mewgenics' launch was bigger than any of The Binding of Isaac's expansions.&nbsp;</p><p>McMillen told <em>IGN</em> that yesterday's launch day, February 10, far surpassed his previous biggest launch-day release. "I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was [The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth], and it sold 40,000 units, I think, day one," McMillen told the publication. Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in under six hours, recouping its development costs in half that time.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ruLQ1Hmhjs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ruLQ1Hmhjs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mewgenics currently has 63,279 people playing the game right now, at the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/">with an all-time peak concurrent of 65,962</a>, just shy of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/250900/charts/">70,762 peak concurrent count</a>. Glaiel told <em>IGN</em>, "We knew the game was good and would do well, but Isaac is huge, so we thought it was unlikely to beat that." It looks as if it will, in fact, beat The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, perhaps this weekend when games typically see their highest concurrent player counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Mewgenics launched on PC on February 10.

The upgraded editions of these uber-popular underwater survival games will bring enhanced resolutions and frame rates to deep-sea adventures, alongside other improvements like optimized Joy-Con 2 controls and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, if you already own Subnautica or Subnautica: Below Zero on Nintendo Switch, you can upgrade to the Switch 2 editions for free via the Nintendo eShop. Unknown Worlds says both games have received graphical improvements for Switch 2 – when docked, players can expect 1440p resolution, while handheld mode supports 1080p. The games run at 60 FPS, docked and handheld, and the optimized Joy-Con 2 controllers enable more precise movement and refined interaction.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTZJU4Lxqi8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTZJU4Lxqi8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"What has always made Subnautica special is the community around it, from the stories players share to the discoveries they make and the sense of wonder that comes from exploring an unknown world together," Unknown Worlds producer Michael Varette writes in a press release. "Bring Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero to Nintendo Switch 2 is about welcoming new players into that community, while giving longtime fans a chance to explore these worlds again in a way that feels fresh, smooth, and more immersive."&nbsp;</p><p>Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero launch on Switch 2 next week on February 17.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the world of Subnautica, Unknown Worlds has released a <a href="https://youtu.be/LYGcagswya4?si=9lu1P4J9N3Yb62AQ">fifth developer vlog</a> for the in-development Subnautica 2, and it focuses on new multiplayer features.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/subnautica/b/pc/archive/2018/02/06/subnautica-game-informer-review.aspx">reviews of Subnautica</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/subnautica-below-zero/subnautica-below-zero-review-thrilling-new-depths">Subnautica: Below Zero</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out these games on Switch 2 next week?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation is hosting a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/psa/2026/02/09/state-of-play-announced-for-this-week-will-feature-over-an-hour-of-third-party-indie">State of Play tomorrow that will feature more than an hour of third-party, indie, and first-party games</a>. While it's likely we'll see Housemarque's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/saros">Saros</a>, considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026">it launches in April</a>, there's one PlayStation 5-exclusive we probably won't hear more about. That game is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a> – when someone on <a href="https://x.com/LukasBoii/status/2021332508688908790?s=20">X</a> asked the official Insomniac Games account when the studio would release more information about the game, Insomniac responded with, "Spring 2026."&nbsp;</p><p>This is a bit surprising as tomorrow's State of Play is one of the longest in recent years, with promised updates about PlayStation's first-party output. With Marvel's Wolverine due out sometime this year, you'd think this State of Play would be a great spot to highlight the game once more. But, it sounds like Insomniac won't be ready to do so until this Spring (which, for reference, begins March 20 in the U.S., where the studio is based).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the meantime, get refreshed on how the game is shaping up in the latest Marvel's Wolverine gameplay trailer:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's still a chance Marvel's Wolverine could appear during tomorrow's State of Play, perhaps as a surprise, but temper your expectations.
