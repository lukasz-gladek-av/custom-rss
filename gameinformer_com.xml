Today, publisher Bandai Namco revealed the player count has leaped to 3.5 million alongside news that duo expeditions are coming to the game in the future.</p><p>The team also says that in addition to DLC releasing later this year, new things will be added to Nighreign, like enhanced boss fights against Nightlords starting this month.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“On the dawn of the fifth day, 3.5 million Nightfarers took up arms against the Night in Elden Ring Nightreign. We are ever grateful for your passion,” a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">post</a> from the Elden Ring X account reads. “But the night is far from over. In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support.”</p><p>Confirming that duo expeditions are coming to Nightreign is exciting, especially as matchmaking for trios is tough, and playing solo is even tougher. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/02/new-elden-ring-nightreign-patch-makes-solo-play-easier-alongside-balance-changes-and-bug">From Software released a patch yesterday</a> that should make the latter easier, though.</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>, and then check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/tips-tricks/2025/05/29/elden-ring-nightreign-beginner-tips-and-tricks"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign beginner tips and tricks</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/03/splitgate-2-launches-into-10-this-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>1047 Games has revealed that its portal-infused Halo-like shooter, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, will launch into 1.0 this week after a short beta period last month. More specifically, Splitgate 2 will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via the Windows Store and Epic Games Store on Friday, June 6.</p><p>Alongside this news, 1047 Games says it has a “major surprise” in store for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/26/the-2025-summer-showcase-schedule">Summer Game Fest</a>, which takes place this Friday at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. The developer says this reveal is the “biggest part” of Splitgate 2.</p><p>To celebrate the release date news, the team has released a trailer about being an ace in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/07/18/splitgate-2-leaps-out-of-a-new-portal-next-year">futuristic portal-y world of Splitgate 2</a>. <strong>Check it out below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdpTm9qfCGE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdpTm9qfCGE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Would-be aces can also jump into Splitgate 2’s final open beta, going on now through launch, to get a taste of some of what the futuristic portal shooter will offer on June 6 – a metric ton of maps, weapons, and modes are all there for the taking,” a press release reads.</p><p>Like the previous betas, it’s free to hop into this one (and the full 1.0 game will be free, as well). Plus, there’s a Beta Battlepass available to get some unlockable cosmetics early in your Splitgate 2 playtime. 1047 Games says progression will not reset when Splitgate 2 launches.</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to hop into Splitgate 2 this week?
