While we were all set for showcases from Summer Game Fest on Friday and Xbox on Sunday, this is a surprise (but a welcome one). Sony's involvement in the yearly rush of summer showcases has been up in the air since it backed out of E3 in 2019, and now all the major players are accounted for (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/here-are-the-retailers-selling-nintendo-switch-2-on-launch-day-without-preorders">save Nintendo, but it has plans of its own this week</a>).</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The showcase will air at 2 PM PT/5 PM ET and will include "news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">according to the PS Blog</a>. It will be available to watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>.</p><p>Aside from that, we don't have any specific details on the games to be featured, but given the time of year, it's fair to assume we'll see some big titles from Sony's upcoming catalogue. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-set-for-october-collectors-edition-revealed">Ghost of Yōtei, which launches this October</a>, is perhaps the most obvious candidate, but there are other PlayStation studios we haven't heard from in a while, including Insomniac, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">which is working on a Wolverine game</a>, and Sony Santa Monica, which we haven't heard much from since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/opinion/2023/12/13/god-of-war-ragnaroks-valhalla-is-so-much-more-than-just-a-roguelite-dlc">God of War Ragnarök's Valhalla DLC</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To catch the rest of the summer showcases live, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/26/the-2025-summer-showcase-schedule" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c895c5c0-7239-4e3c-ac2b-a4d3d1713a08" data-entity-substitution="canonical">check out our big 2025 livestream schedule</a>, giving times for everything from Summer Game Fest to the Wholesome Direct.</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to see from this showcase?
