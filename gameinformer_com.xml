<p>Mike Bithell came to prominence with Thomas Was Alone, a narrative-driven abstract puzzle-platformer. After forming Bithell Games, the studio gained a strong reputation for well-received releases such as the 2015 stealth game <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/volume/b/pc/archive/2015/08/17/volume-review-game-informer.aspx">Volume</a> and the acclaimed 2017 text-based adventure titles Subsurface Circular. The last few years have seen it delve into making inventive and stylish takes on licensed properties, such as the strategy title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/john-wick-hex/john-wick-hex-review-a-slow-motion-ballet-of-blood">John Wick Hex</a> (which was delisted last month), the visual novel puzzle title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tron-identity/grid-based-decision-making">Tron: Identity</a>, and 2025’s Tron: Catalyst, a top-down action game. Bithell Games has also published titles from its label developer Lunar Division: The Banished Vault and the upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350750/Amberspire/">Amberspire</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/08/volume-john-wick-hex-studio-bithell-games-loses-majority-of-staff-to-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
