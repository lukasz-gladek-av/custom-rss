Today, publisher Devolver Digital announced it would be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Switch 2 on December 8.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can check out the announcement trailer below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Je1WXy3T6o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Je1WXy3T6o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The game features some fascinating visuals, with a hazy lo-fi filter and an abstract take on Hell. By eating the moon, the Devil will give you your soul back, and based on this trailer, the path to the moon is paved with a lot of curbs and rails to grind on.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a press release, the game has over 70 tricks to learn, and by doing so, you can unlock new boards, wheels, gear, and more. The journey is accompanied by an intense soundtrack from the band Blood Cultures, which features heavy synthesizers and light, distant vocals, and additional tracks composed by John Fio.</p><p>&nbsp;If you want to try the game for yourself, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/">there's a Steam demo available right now</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/09/skate-story-devolvers-surreal-skateboard-game-launches-this-december]]></content:encoded>
