Dubbed simply <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2</em>, the upcoming anime features a fresh story and a new director.&nbsp;</p><p>Announced during a behind-the-scenes panel with <em>Edgerunners’</em> creators and cast during Anime Expo in Los Angeles over the weekend, <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2</em> sees CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger rekindle their partnership to bring the sequel series to Netflix. The original <em>Edgerunners</em> serves as a prequel to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/cyberpunk-2077/cyberpunk-2077-review-a-wild-time-in-night-city">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, though it is unclear when this follow-up will occur and if it will feature any returning characters. Check out the teaser trailer for <em>Edgerunners 2</em> below (<strong>but beware of spoilers for the first series</strong>).</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdwAiyfrMO8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdwAiyfrMO8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The panel also revealed prolific animator Kai Ikarashi as <em>Edgerunners 2</em>’s director, taking the mantle from the previous series’ director, Hiroyuki Imaishi.

"And to again have the legendary animation studio Trigger along for the ride makes us at CD Projekt Red so excited to introduce a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before."</p><p>In addition to Sztybor, the returning production crew includes lead character designer Kanno Ichigo and screenplay writer Masahiko Otsuka. The voice cast has not been revealed.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/07/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-is-a-standalone-sequel-series-coming-to-netflix]]></content:encoded>
