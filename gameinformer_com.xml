Suspectives is the first game revealed for the new pack and you can check out the trailer for it below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YT3BXNBp-xE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes inspiration from party games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_Within">Werewolves Within</a> where one player is a secret criminal and the others must deduce who it is. This is done by players sharing personal anecdotes about themselves and then those details become part of the investigation process.</p>

<p>According to the press release for the new game, "Suspectives is a detective-themed social deduction game where players work together to uncover the secret criminal hiding among them. The only clues left behind? Facts that players share about themselves. Suspectives turns players’ quirky personal details into the key evidence for solving a crime. Players must put each other in the hot seat to determine if the evidence stacks up against them."</p>

<p>The game is designed for 4-8 players and rounds can be played in about 10-15 minutes. As mentioned previously, The Jackbox Party Pack 11 is coming later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-makes-its-playstation-debut-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’ve seen more and more Xbox first-party franchises launching on PlayStation over the last year or so, and arguably Microsoft’s second-biggest exclusive franchise is next in line. Gears of War is finally making its debut on Sony platforms in the form of a remaster dubbed Gears of War: Reloaded.</p>

<p>Reloaded, which is also coming to Xbox, is billed as the definitive version of the original Gears of War, first released in 2006. It has been natively optimized for modern platforms, boasting a 4K resolution and support for 120 frames per second gameplay. Multiplayer includes cross-play across all platforms, and a Microsoft account is not required for online play (most relevant for PS players). The game also features cross-progression, letting you carry campaign and multiplayer progress across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Content-wise, Reloaded includes everything included in the previous remaster, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/gears_of_war_ultimate_edition/b/xboxone/archive/2015/08/26/restored-beauty.aspx">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>. That includes all post-launch DLC, the bonus campaign act, all multiplayer maps/modes, and the complete roster of characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression.&nbsp;</p>
