            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Switch 2 continues to be a sales juggernaut, as Nintendo has announced that it has sold over 10 million Switch 2 consoles in its first six months.</p><p>In its <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">2nd quarter fiscal year report</a>, Nintendo states 10.36 million Switch 2 units have been sold from its June 5 launch through the end of September. Although Nintendo frames this number as an overall decrease from the Switch 2’s hot start, which established it as the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/11/nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-35-million-units-sold-in">fastest-selling home console ever</a>, it has remained a strong performer.&nbsp;</p><p>This number now means that Switch 2 is selling more than twice as fast as the original Switch did during the same launch period (4.7 million in its first six months in 2017). The Switch 2 has also outperformed the PlayStation 5's sales during its first six months (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/04/28/playstation-shatters-industry-sale-records-for-fy2020-over-78-million-ps5-consoles-sold">7.8 million</a>), albeit that console also suffered from supply shortages.</p>

      <p>Mario Kart World</p>
  
</article>

<p>The report also reveals sales figures for the Switch 2’s marquee first-party titles, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/breaking-through-to-something-new">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Mario Kart World, a launch title that was also a pack-in for the $499 Switch 2 bundle, has sold 9.57 million units, with 8.1 million from the console bundle. This means nearly every Switch 2 owner grabbed a copy of the latest Mario racer. Donkey Kong Bananza, which launched on July 17, has sold 3.49 million copies. Overall software sales for Switch 2 in the first half of the fiscal year sit at 20.62 million.</p><p>With the holiday season approaching, the recent launch of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a/maintaining-rank">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> (of which sales data is not yet available), and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hits-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-this-december">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on December 4, it’s likely the Switch 2 will continue its strong momentum heading into 2026. In fact, Nintendo has modified its sales forecast for the next fiscal year; it now expects to sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles before the end of March 2026, up from its previous forecast of 15 million.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on Switch 2, you can see what remaining games will hit the console this year with our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/29/2025-nintendo-switch-2-game-release-schedule">Switch 2 release calendar</a>.

As such, you can expect all kinds of coverage about the game from our time visiting Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices to play Reimagined for two hours and interview various leads on the development team. That coverage begins today!</p><p>While talking to Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa about this remake – Square Enix's second remake following the release of the original Dragon Quest VII in 2001 (in the U.S.) and the Nintendo 3DS remake in 2016 – he spoke about some of the changes happening in the main scenario. We'll have more on that this month, but for now, I want to focus on something that might excite players already familiar with the narrative of Dragon Quest VII: a new ending.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"[Reimagined] follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations," Ichikawa tells me. "So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn't glean much more from Ichikawa about this new conclusion, but Reimagined launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on February 5, so we don't have to wait too long to learn more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion]]></content:encoded>
