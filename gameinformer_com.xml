            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-deep-dive-details-new-vault-hunters-open-world-changes-loot-shakeups-and<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gearbox Software gave us our first big deep dive into Borderlands 4 courtesy of its own dedicated PlayStation State of Play. The 20-minute presentation revealed two of the game’s four new vault hunters, broke down its new loot and progression systems, and new streamlined approaches to co-op.</p>

<p>The State of Play introduced us to Vault Hunters: Vex the Siren and Rafa the Exo-Soldier. Vex is a winged mercenary capable of conjuring ghost-like minions to fight alongside her while empowering her own abilities. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier proficient in a variety of firearms. Vault Hunters are accompanied by Echo 4, a new robotic companion that guides players toward objectives, can hack terminals and machines, and scan the environment to find useful objects. Confirmed returning characters include Claptrap, Moxxi, Lilith, and Borderlands 3’s Vault Hunters Zane and Amara.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game’s setting of Kairo is a new planet boasting four distinct biomes players can travel between seamlessly. This world had been kept hidden for thousands of years by its ruler and the game’s antagonist, the Timekeeper. This dictator rules his citizens by implanting them cybernetic parts called Bolts and polices Kairos using his own personal army of synthetic soldiers called The Order. Regarding the series’ signature comedic tone, Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford noted that Borderlands 4 will return to “a more grounded tone” reminiscent of the first two games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking a page from live service titles like Destiny, the open world features dynamic weather and events, such as world bosses and border patrols. Players can even spawn their own speeder bike-like vehicle (which can be customized) to cruise across the terrain quickly. Speaking of getting around, new traversal abilities include Glide, which allows players to float through the air to cover long distances. Characters also sport a wrist-mounted grapple hook to quickly scale vertical platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each Vault Hunter sports three Action Skills, class-specific abilities. Each Action Skill has its own skill tree and can be further bolstered by augments and capstones to change or improve its properties. Vault Hunters also sport passive abilities called Traits.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Borderlands is all about loot, and the fourth entry features weapons from eight manufacturers, three new to the series: Jakobs, Maliwan, Vladof, Tediore, Torque, and the newly added Order, Ripper, and Daedalus. Each brand sports various perks and traits, and a new Licensed Parts system combines various abilities from multiple manufacturers into a single weapon.</p>

<p>Enhancements replace Artifacts and act as gear slots to augment weapons based on the manufacturer. An example would be an Enhancement that deals extra firepower for using a Tediore gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grenades and heavy weapons like rocket launchers no longer take up slots in your gun rotation. Instead, they occupy a new shared slot called Ordnance and now operate on a recharging cooldown meter. This means you can use these more explosive weapons continuously in any encounter.</p>

<p>Overall, Gearbox is responding to player feedback by overhauling loot drop rates to ensure rarities matter again. To that end, it states Legendaries now drop far less frequently than in Borderlands 3 to ensure they feel special again. The ability to replay entire missions and boss fights has also been added, meaning players can easily re-run bosses without reloading saves.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Fight For Your Life returns as the last-chance opportunity to save yourself when downed. However, a new piece of gear called Rep Kit lets players heal themselves or activate temporary buffs to raise their odds during firefights.</p>

<p>The four-player online multiplayer has been simplified with an improved lobby system for easier matchmaking. Co-op players can also set their difficulty individually without affecting everyone else, meaning one player can play using an easier setting while another plays on a more challenging mode. Loot is also instanced for each player, meaning no one misses out on any drops. Borderlands 4 also features two-player local splitscreen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is getting its first hands-on event sometime in June (possibly during Summer Games Fest) and launches on September 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The game will also be coming to Switch 2 later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming party game, which pits 32 players against each other as various Sonic characters in platforming-focused challenges, has been pushed to an undetermined date. Sega <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000145/">states</a> the reason is due to player feedback from the ongoing pre-launch period, as well as the impending introduction of new modes arriving in Update 1.2. These modes are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rumble Ranking</strong> - Compete within the league you belong to based on the scores you earn during the period and get rewards according to your final ranking.</li>
	<li><strong>Crews</strong> - Create a Rumbler group with your in-game friends, and achieve score missions together.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills</strong> - Equip characters with unique abilities, adding a new layer of gameplay depth.</li>
</ul>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ve3OC40IxvQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Sega claims these additions will “fundamentally reshape the game,” necessitating the delay. It’s holding a Discord Q&amp;A tomorrow, May 1, to answer any questions players may have about the release update and the game overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whenever Sonic Rumble does arrive, it will be available on PC and mobile via iOS and Android.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/words-with-friends-bolsters-single-player-content-with-letter-lock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Since its introduction in 2009, Words With Friends has been a crown jewel of mobile gaming giant Zynga's portfolio and one of the most popular mobile games ever. Though famously a multiplayer title, Zynga has recently added some solo content. Today, Zynga is introducing Letter Lock, a new daily single-player puzzle for users to tackle within Words With Friends, giving fans of word-puzzle games like Wordle another game to work into their daily ritual.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though distinct from the mechanics of Wordle, Letter Lock certainly seems poised to capitalize on the existing player base of that game, which launched in 2021 and was purchased by&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>New York Times Games </em>in 2022. Similar to Wordle, Words With Friends: Letter Lock gives you vertical columns of letters with which to make words. As you make more valid words, you inch closer to completing that day's puzzle, and additional letter columns can unlock more word possibilities. Each wrong word takes a heart away, and if you lose too many hearts, you lose.</p>

<p>You can see the full trailer of Words With Friends: Letter Lock below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JR1ihNmFpgo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Though Words With Friends is known for its multiplayer content that borrows heavily from the iconic board game Scrabble, Zynga has committed to introducing multiple single-player puzzles and word games since November 2024. Since then, the game has added Mini Crosswords, Word Wheel, Guest Word, and Word Search. According to Zynga, up to 70 percent of the Words With Friends player base has started its play sessions by playing Word Search before accessing the competitive multiplayer side that the game is known for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The new Letter Lock daily puzzle feature is a testament to Zynga's continued creative investment in Words With Friends that's informed by feedback from our dedicated fan base," executive vice president of mobile games at Zynga, Yaron Leyvand, said in a press release. "I strongly believe delivering fresh experiences for players is the key to continuous engagement and the long-term success of the title as an entertainment phenomenon."</p>

<p>Words With Friends is available as a free download with microtransactions on the iOS and Android stores.&nbsp;</p>
