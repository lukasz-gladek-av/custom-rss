            <div property="schema:text"><p>Flameo! Magic: The Gathering's <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set is dropping soon, bringing the journey of Aang and the gang to life in booster packs and drafts around the world. Wizards of the Coast offered us the opportunity to reveal some cards in the upcoming set, both new and familiar.</p><p>Our new card is leaning into the "Ally" creature type, as well as multi-colored deckbuilding. The Earthen Ally is a humble 0/2 for one Green mana, gaining power for each color among Allies you control. Heck, you can pay a whopping 2 plus WUBRG (that's one of each color of mana, plus an additional two mana) to Earthbend 5. (Earthbend is a new keyword that makes your lands attackers, essentially.)</p><p>We also have a batch of additional cards, which are reprinted versions of past Magic: The Gathering cards. Meteorite, Sunbaked Canyon, Treetop Village, Volcanic Torrent, and Warstorm Surge all get their own animated adaptations here in the cards. I like having a new Sunbaked Canyon to put in my Boros deck, and Treetop is a fun, classic reprint that lines up well with the Earthbending archetype.</p><p>It certainly looks like Magic: The Gathering is doing some fun things with its adaptation of <em>Avatar</em>. The full set will arrive on November 21, with pre-release events kicking off the weekend prior on November 14.</p></div>
