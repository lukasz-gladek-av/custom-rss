            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’re excited to announce that <em>Game Informer</em> Issue 374, arriving in mailboxes and at newsstands in January, features an extensive cover story on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/world-of-warcraft-midnight">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. My 12-page deep dive offers exclusive insights into the making of the upcoming expansion, including its massive player housing feature, the reimagining of the Quel'Thalas zone, a fresh playable Allied Race, and the Demon Hunter class's new Devourer specialization. Notably, we've also secured a few exclusive details about the team's reimagining of Northrend, arguably the game's most iconic location to date, which arrives in the subsequent expansion, The Last Titan.</p><p>Covering a video game with such a rich history as World of Warcraft requires a measure of thoroughness that's hard to fit into a single story, so associate editor Charles Harte accompanied me to Blizzard's headquarters to author a retrospective that serves as a fantastic primer for anyone reading about the 21-year-old MMORPG for the first time. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">Subscribers gain early access</a> to the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/wowmidnight">magazine's digital version</a> and can expect supplemental online and video coverage through January.&nbsp;</p>

We're also excited to reveal some exclusive new details on the anticipated Scott Pilgrim EX, leading into our preview coverage for the issue on games like Nioh 3 and SOL Shogunate. And don't miss our fascinating feature-length look at the explosive growth of the Soulslike genre, and our comprehensive look back at the history of Fallout.

<p>The cover art depicts a crimson-haired Blood Elf returning home, spoils in hand, as her neighborhood brims with life in the background. Lil ' Deathwing and Weechi, two well-known pets from World of Warcraft, chase each other beneath the elf's feet as an Orc and a Goblin wave to a Tauren neighbor while driving past on a Mechano-Hog.
