It revealed this during today's Summer Games Fest showcase with a new gameplay trailer.&nbsp;</p><p>Set in the years 1915 and 1943 (at least), this action game oozes the style and substance of RGG's Like a Dragon series, but with some 20th-century noir flair, and it looks awesome. When we first saw Project Century last year, we saw a game set in 1915, but in today's trailer, Stranger Than Heaven brings us to 1943, a different decade. Fortunately, all the fisticuff combat from 1915 remains in this 1943 look at the game, and if these two trailers together are any indication, it seems Stranger Than Heaven will jump between different time periods.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Stranger Than Heaven reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's no release date or projected platforms for Stranger Than Heaven.
