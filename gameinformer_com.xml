            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Shovel Knight Developer Yacht Club Games has delayed its anticipated follow-up, the Zelda-inspired <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/mina-the-hollower-the-next-game-from-the-creators-of-shovel-knight-launches">Mina the Hollower</a>. The upcoming game was scheduled to launch on October 31.</p><p>Initially crowdfunded via Kickstarter, Mina the Hollower centers on the titular mouse, a scientist and explorer who embarks on a mission to rescue a cursed island. The top-down action game sports a retro aesthetic reminiscent of Game Boy Color titles while its combat evokes The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania. As a Hollower, Mina can burrow underground, which plays a substantial role in combat and exploration.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">blog post</a>, Yacht Club explains that despite working tirelessly to get Mina ready for launch, &nbsp;it says, “we’re just not quite there yet.” The studio then clarifies that the delay won’t be a big one, and the team will spend this time applying additional polish, fine-tuning balancing, finalizing art and sound, and implementing localization.</p><p>“With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!" reads Yacht Club's blog post. Yacht Club did not announce a new launch date for Mina the Hollower, as it wants to wait until the game is submitted to platforms for review.&nbsp;</p><p>Mina the Hollower is currently slated to launch on PC and all major consoles, including a recently announced Switch 2 version.

Valley of Memory is a new story chapter that adds hours of new narrative threads and gameplay content.&nbsp;</p><p>Arriving on November 18 via an update for all owners of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, Valley of Memory is a roughly six-hour expansion set before the conclusion of the main story. Protagonist Basim learns a rumor that his long-lost father is alive in the ancient valley of al-Ula, and sets off to find him. When Basim arrives, he discovers al-Ula has been overtaken by robbers.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TjZ8XG8QBY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TjZ8XG8QBY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Valley of Memory unfolds in a new region and introduces new main and side quests, assassination targets, replayable contracts, and more. Ubisoft also teases new twists on the classic black box missions. The region of al-Ula boasts new landmarks to explore such as the Musa Ibn Musayr fortress, the necropolis of Hegra, and the Valley of the Stones.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the Valley of Memory expansion adds quality-of-life features such as two new difficulty levels, the Engineer 2 skill and new level 4 modification for all tools. Parkour updates add the option to toggle manual jumping, an easier control scheme, and the ability to side and back-eject from walls regardless of the landing spot. &nbsp;</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and iOS.
