            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Gearbox Software has released the first story trailer for its upcoming looter-shooter, Borderlands 4, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/19/borderlands-4-is-coming-to-game-informers-cover">which is also the game gracing the next issue of <em>Game Informer </em>magazine</a>, and it highlights the new setting of Kairos, the four new Vault Hunters, the villainous Timekeeper, and more. Plus, it ends with details about the bonuses you'll get for preordering Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</p><p>"Get a glimpse of the Timekeeper's cruel reign, including the disturbing process of being implanted with a Bolt â€“ a spine-grafted cybernetic device used to dominate the populace," the trailer's description reads. "Soon after crash-landing, the Vault Hunters are arrested and forcibly affixed with the device, trapping them on Kairos."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Borderlands 4 story trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/onY6y4NZ-t4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Timekeeper and his Order rule over Kairos from the impenetrable fortress location of Dominion City. When Elpis arrived in Kairos' orbit and unleashed cataclysmic destruction, the Timekeeper locked Dominion City down and sent in his commanders to handle the fallout. Today, the Timekeeper watches over Kairos from the safety of his tower, letting these Commanders maintain his Order, Gearbox says.&nbsp;</p><p>"From humble beginnings, you'll need to travel across Kairos and ignite the revolution against the Timekeeper," Gearbox says. "People all across Kairos have begun to rise up, and this powderkeg is set to explode. Enter Claptrap, self-proclaimed mastermind behind the Crimson Resistance, who's set on making the Vault Hunters his newest recruits."&nbsp;</p><p>The trailer ends with a look at the preorder bonuses for Borderlands 4, which you can view in the image below:&nbsp;</p>
