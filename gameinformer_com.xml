<p>If its roughly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic reveal trailer is any indication, it looks to be a terrifying Joseon-era game action fans should keep an eye on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out the Woochi the Wayfarer reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Woochi the Wayfarer is inspired by "The Tale of Jeon Woochi," a classic Korean novel that follows the adventures of the titular Jeon Woochi, "who uses his powers to fight injustice and trick the corrupt," according to a press release. The game will be a single-player narrative-driven adventure that fuses magical settings with traditional Korean monsters and music.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of music, <em>Parasite </em>and <em>Squid Game </em>composer Jung Jae-il is handling the game's score. Nexon is publishing it, and LoreVault Studio is developing the game.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no word on when Woochi the Wayfarer will launch.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read about Nexon's push to bring its Korean-developed games to global audiences in this <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/05/30/the-first-descendant-nexon-aims-for-the-west-with-upcoming-rpg-shooter">behind-the-scenes feature</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think about this reveal trailer?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> launched last October, and though it fared decently amongst fans, publisher <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA said it missed sales expectations by 50%,</a> bringing in roughly 1.5 million players instead of the anticipated 3 million it had hoped. Those missed expectations have left fans wondering what the future of the series looks like while <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/new-mass-effect-5-trailer-teases-original-trilogy-andromeda-and-maybe-a-new">BioWare works on the next Mass Effect game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back on the franchise, however, we've recently learned BioWare, at one point, softly pitched a trilogy remaster of the first three Dragon Age games, but it was turned down by EA. That's according to Mark Darrah, former Dragon Age series producer and BioWare executive, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">a new interview with MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-has-there-never-been-a-dragon-age-origins-remaster-bioware-exec-explains-past-plans-and-continued-difficulties"><em>IGN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I honestly think they should do – I don't think they will, but they should do – a remaster of the first three [Dragon Age games]," Darrah, who left BioWare in 2020 but consulted on last year's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, said to MrMattyPlays. "One of the things we pitched at one point – pretty softly, so pitched is a massive overstatement – was to retroactively rebrand the first games as if they were a trilogy, call it the Champions Trilogy, so you have these larger-than-life heroes... maybe you do that as a first step."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-MRprT3Fnk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-MRprT3Fnk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As for why this trilogy remaster, which would consist of Dragon Age: Origins (2009), Dragon Age II (2011), and Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014), never came to light, Darrah places the blame on EA.&nbsp;</p><p>"EA's historically been – and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly – they're kind of against remasters," he told MrMattyPlays. "I don't really know why, and it's strange for a publicly traded company to seemingly be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that's part of it."&nbsp;</p><p>Darrah later posits that a Dragon Age trilogy is a more challenging task than, say, a Mass Effect trilogy (which EA and BioWare did in the form of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mass-effect-legendary-edition/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review-a-great-way-to-honor">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> in 2021), because of the series' storied development history and the engines used to create the games.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard/sticking-the-landing"><em>Game Informer's </em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, and then check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/DragonAgeTheVeilguard"><em>Game Informer's </em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story hub</a> for exclusive details and interviews about the game's development and more.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[<strong>Source</strong>: </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><em>MrMattyPlays</em></a><em> via </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-has-there-never-been-a-dragon-age-origins-remaster-bioware-exec-explains-past-plans-and-continued-difficulties"><em>IGN</em></a><em>]</em></p><hr><p><em>Do you want a Dragon Age trilogy remaster?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-2042/battlefield-2042-review-the-battle-of-the-bugs">the bug-riddled launch of Battlefield 2042</a> back in 2021, EA has been working to revitalize the Battlefield series’ name, placing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/respawns-vince-zampella-becomes-head-of-battlefield-amidst-wider-franchise-changes-that">Respawn’s Vince Zampella as its head amidst the creation of a wider Battlefield universe</a>. If the recent Battlefield 6 beta over the weekend is any indication, those efforts are paying off. Not only did the beta surpass Call of Duty’s all-time player count, but it also reached a new concurrent peak for the Battlefield series.&nbsp;</p><p>EA calls the Battlefield 6 open beta <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/lock-and-load-for-the-open-beta">its biggest ever</a>, and Weekend 1 (Aug. 9-10) just wrapped up. Throughout the weekend, and on Aug. 7 and Aug. 8, when invite-only players could hop in early, I saw screenshots across social media showing queues stretching into the hundreds of thousands – a lot of people were playing this game.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Using SteamDB, a database that tracks Steam concurrent player counts, that checks out. On Saturday, the Battlefield 6 open beta peaked with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079 players</a>, which is also an all-time peak for the entire Battlefield series. That number eclipses <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">the peak of Call of Duty at 491,670, </a>too, though it’s important to note these are just Steam numbers and console players could sway this observation in either direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the point stands – Battlefield 6 is something players are excited about. The real test will be how many of these open beta (see: free) players will convert into paid players when Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31">watch the Battlefield 6 debut trailer</a> and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/01/familiar-yet-cinematic">our preview of Battlefield 6’s multiplayer</a> after going hands-on with it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Did you hop into the Battlefield 6 open beta this weekend?
