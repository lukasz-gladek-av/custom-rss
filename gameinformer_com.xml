            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Can't stop, won't stop... is what I think publishers and developers are saying this month because what is going on?! There are so many games coming out this month! We're two weeks into October and we've published at least three reviews each of those weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>We posted reviews for Double Fine's new lighthouse adventure game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/keeper/surreal-wonder">Keeper</a>, which reviewer Matt Miller calls a surrealist piece of art with light puzzle elements; we posted a review for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/lukewarm-blooded">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> (a former <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/07/22/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer </em>cover game</a>), which reviewer Charles Harte called a letdown but not without its fun; and finally, we published our thoughts on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ball-x-pit/breathtaking-brick-breaking">Ball x Pit</a>, which Miller says is a deeply satsifying update to the ancient arcade formula of brick-breaking action. On top of all that, we also covered the week's biggest news, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/wizarding-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-to-2026">Witchbrook being delayed to 2026</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/07/22/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cover-story">3D Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki's death</a>, posted a preview for Quantic Dream's new multiplayer game called <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/16/quantic-dream-is-making-spellcasters-chronicles-a-multiplayer-game-heres-what-we-think">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, and of course, posted all kinds of exclusives for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, another week has passed. With the end of this week, I've rounded up some video game thoughts from the editors here at <em>Game Informer </em>to help make your weekend gameplay plans a little easier. Without further ado...</p><h2>Games To Check Out This Weekend</h2></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinions/2025/10/17/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-october-17-2025]]></content:encoded>
