            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Carin, the survival mountain climbing game set to release on November 4, has been delayed to Q1 2026. The game was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/cairn-is-a-new-climbing-adventure-survival-game-from-the-developers-behind">first revealed</a> during Summer Game Fest 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Developed by The Game Bakers, the creators of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/furi/b/playstation4/archive/2016/07/14/a-stylish-fight-with-frustration.aspx">Furi </a>and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/haven/haven-review-love-conquers-some">Haven</a>, Cairn centers on protagonist Aava embarking on an expedition to climb the perilous Mount Kami. The game features realistic climbing mechanics and physics, as players must carefully manage their tools and resources (like food and water) to gradually work their way towards the summit.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZiy36vcB5Q"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZiy36vcB5Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Game Bakers says that although Cairn is content complete, it needs a few more months to focus on optimization, debugging, and overall polish. “We have been running a lot of playtests, and the feedback from players is that we have something truly special with Cairn. We also see all the improvements we can still do to make the experience unforgettable. After 5 years of work, it makes no sense to rush it, we want to be proud of the game we launch,” explained creative director Emeric Thoa.</p><p>Although Cairn has no new release date, the game’s well-received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Steam demo</a> will be updated on October 13, which will allow players to see the “ghosts” of other players climbing alongside them. Players can race against these specters, or follow them to find hidden paths, but this feature will only be available for a limited time. A new trailer shows off this update below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko_d5JyQNKM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko_d5JyQNKM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Cairn launches next year, it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/30/survival-mountain-climbing-game-cairn-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>
