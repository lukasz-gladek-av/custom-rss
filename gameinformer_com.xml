            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the most exciting superhero games on the horizon is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-skydances-captain-americablack-panther-game-arriving-next">Marvel 1943: The Rise of Hydra</a>. Set during World War II, it shows Captain America crossing paths with an early Black Panther (Azurri, T'Challa's grandfather) to stop the villainous Marvel faction Hydra. While we were excited to play it early next year, we've now learned that won't be the case, as it's been delayed indefinitely.</p><p>The news came <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440">via a post on developer Skydance's social media</a>, which announces that the delay will push the game "beyond early 2026," but doesn't clarify anything more than that. It could come later next year, or be delayed even further. You can read the full message in the image below, or in plain text below that.</p>
