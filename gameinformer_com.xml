            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/destiny-2s-next-expansion-the-edge-of-fate-will-be-revealed-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape wrapped up the decade-long story that began in the first game, and fans will soon find out where the franchise is heading next. Bungie has announced a reveal event for the game’s next expansion, The Edge of Fate, on May 6.</p>

<p>The event will air at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET. Bungie promises to detail The Edge of Fate and “much more,” but it doesn’t elaborate further than that. Originally codenamed Apollo, The Edge of Fate will be the start of a brand-new saga, as well as the first step of the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">Year 11 roadmap</a>&nbsp;(posted below) the studio revealed last September.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going forward, Destiny 2 will receive two medium-sized expansions per year with four free content updates each year. Bungie also wants to get more experimental with its campaign structure, teasing ideas such as non-linear formats and tinkering with other genres such as Metroidvanias, roguelikes, and survival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bungie provided some insight into The Edge of Fate’s non-linear progression in its roadmap, stating, “Because the more you play and discover, the more the story progresses, so experiencing a certain number of threads opens up the next part of the story. The order in which you explore will be something you choose, but we have built Codename: Apollo in a way the story always makes sense and flows from beginning to middle to end. There’s no time gating, no waiting for the next drop. Codename: Apollo’s story unfolds based on player progression.”</p>

</article><p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape received critical acclaim last year, concluding the Light and Dark storyline. We scored the expansion a 9 out of 10, with editor-in-chief Matt Miller writing in his <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/destiny-2-the-final-shape/for-the-guardians">review</a>: “Over the years, Destiny 2 has ballooned into a massive and unwieldy beast, filled with cooperative and competitive experiences, hundreds of named characters and organizations, and an often-unapproachable vernacular that can take a long time to learn to speak and play. With The Final Shape, Bungie makes no apologies for the complexity but does finally offer purposeful punctuation to mark an endpoint. Largely unencumbered by what has come before, the frontiers ahead are now open to be revealed.”</p>

<p>This will be the second big reveal event this year for Bungie, having hosted a similar coming out party for Marathon this past weekend. You can check out the first gameplay footage of the upcoming shooter <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay">here</a>.</p>
