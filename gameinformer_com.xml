As such, you can expect all kinds of coverage about the game from our time visiting Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices to play Reimagined for two hours and interview various leads on the development team. That coverage begins today!</p><p>While talking to Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa about this remake – Square Enix's second remake following the release of the original Dragon Quest VII in 2001 (in the U.S.) and the Nintendo 3DS remake in 2016 – he spoke about some of the changes happening in the main scenario. We'll have more on that this month, but for now, I want to focus on something that might excite players already familiar with the narrative of Dragon Quest VII: a new ending.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"[Reimagined] follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations," Ichikawa tells me. "So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn't glean much more from Ichikawa about this new conclusion, but Reimagined launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on February 5, so we don't have to wait too long to learn more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion]]></content:encoded>
