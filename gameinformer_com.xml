            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I bought a Riffmaster Wireless Guitar this weekend because they were $50 off (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/RIFFMASTER-Controller-Xbox-Rechargeable-Officially-Microsoft/dp/B0CWN15TRF?th=1">and still are, I believe</a>). I have been hunting for a full Rock Band 4 set at a reasonable price for a few years, and it has been a futile exercise. But the Riffmaster guitar, plus Fortnite Festival, has gotten me close to the nostalgic Rock Band/Guitar Hero experience I have been pining for. I was initially underwhelmed by the song selection. It had some music I liked, but it was limited, and there is no simple option to outright buy songs that have been available to play in the past. I know this is the standard Fortnite operating procedure – arbitrary limitations on digital goods in order to exploit the player base (which I remind you is mostly children) into making purchases because they won't be available soon. Everything sucks and I hate it.</p><p>But, moving on from that ongoing frustration with modern video games, I was surprised to learn the song selection gets swapped out often. Daily, it seems. Which means logging in every day provides new songs. And today, in particular, the selection lined up much more with my taste. Chappell Roan songs (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PINzY8ErwGo">not surprising considering she was recently added to the game</a> [but no "Pink Pony Club" which <em>is</em> surprising]), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocXEwsJGOQ">Hatsune Miku and Anamanguchi mash-up</a>, Fall Out Boy music from their first album (I never listened to any of the other ones), and "Welcome Home" from Coheed &amp; Cambria. I played a bunch of great songs and I will see what's new tomorrow. They've hooked me in, the jerks. Also, sometimes my character just isn't holding a guitar. See Ms. Roan above. I am not sure why.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/06/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-6]]></content:encoded>
