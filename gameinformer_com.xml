Movie</a>, is getting a dedicated Nintendo Direct later this week. According to the Nintendo Today app and <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">social media posts</a>, the livestream will air at 9 AM ET/ 6 AM PT.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer," the social media post reads. "Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation."</p><p>While it's not surprising, eager fans can rule out the possibility of news of a new Mario game during this stream. If it's anything like the Direct for the last Mario movie, it will likely include some statements from people at Nintendo and Illumination, add in a potential casting reveal, and conclude with a teaser from the film. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPCXuvL8EM">You can check out the last direct as a reference here</a>.</p><p>While we don't know much about the Super Mario Galaxy movie, we know a few things. Much of the main cast is confirmed to return, but while Rosalina is a crucial part of the Mario Galaxy games, we don't know for certain whether she'll appear. On the other hand, Yoshi, one of the most recognizable faces in the Mario universe, will very likely make an appearance. This floating green dinosaur was teased at the end of the first movie when a Yoshi egg was revealed to be sitting in the sewers. We also know Yoshi appears in the movie because, of all things, it was revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">via a box of Mario-themed cookie dough</a>.</p><p>When the Direct does go live on Wednesday, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yqjMaKQskW8">watch on YouTube</a> or on the Nintendo Today app.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/10/a-nintendo-direct-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-blasts-off-november-12]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The nominations list for the 2026 Grammy awards dropped recently, renewing the fierce yearly debates over what should win, what should lose, and what was snubbed entirely. In the gaming space, this is no different, as this year marks the fourth time soundtracks for video games and other interactive media are eligible for their own category. If you haven't seen the full list yet, here are this year's nominees.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/tripping-through-jungles">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - Secrets of the Spires (composed by Pinar Toprak)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> (composed by Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/worthy-of-a-museum">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> (composed by Gordy Haab)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-outlaws/transitional-open-world-approach">Star Wars Outlaws</a>: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate's Fortune (composed by Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sword-of-the-sea/beauty-for-the-sake-of-beauty">Sword of the Sea</a> (composed by Austin Wintory)</li></ul><p>If you've been paying attention to the games industry this year, there are a few elements of this list that feel off. The first is the release dates; three of the five games (namely Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Helldivers 2, and Star Wars Outlaws) fall squarely out of the typical nomination window, which includes releases between August 31, 2024 and August 30, 2025. The catch, however, is that Avatar and Star Wars games got nominations for their DLC packs, which were released more recently – each base game was already nominated last year. As for Helldivers II, a game released in February 2024, my guess is that it's eligible because of its Xbox port this past August.&nbsp;</p><p>These sorts of timeline shenanigans aren't unheard of with Grammys, even in major categories. For example, Wildflower by Billie Eilish was released on an album in May 2024, but because it was re-released as a single in February 2025, it's up for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at this year's awards.</p><p>The other way this feels off, however, is the relative impact of each soundtrack across video game culture. Star Wars and Avatar feel out of place in this regard as well, as both games are relatively well-regarded but didn't have the same impact among gamers, and that sentiment extends to their soundtracks. Neither was nominated for best music at last year's game awards, for example. But less egregious than their inclusion means the exclusion of other huge games, most notably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's a big enough deal that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/awintory.bsky.social/post/3m52iiiczks2h">nominee Austin Wintory called it out on social media</a>, even offering to trade his place for the smash-hit RPG. While we do think it's an oversight, Wintory's inclusion is no surprise, as he's currently tied for the most nominations in the category since its first year. You can read more on his background and approach to composition in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/06/24/the-music-had-to-come-from-somewhere" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee2da82-3f52-4203-9f3f-47961c40cda2" data-entity-substitution="canonical">this interview from earlier this year</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vo1By2krjCY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vo1By2krjCY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The other video game-specific news from this year's Grammy nominations is that <a href="https://www.the8bitbigband.com/">The 8-Bit Big Band</a>, a jazz group that does covers of video game music, has been nominated in non-gaming categories for the third year. Its recent album, <a href="https://the8bitbigband.bandcamp.com/album/album-5-orchestrator-emulator"><em>Orchestra Emulator</em></a>, is up for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album, while the song "Super Mario Praise Break" is up for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella. While it's very exciting to see video game soundtracks get recognized in a dedicated category, it's also exciting to see classic game songs break into more mainstream categories.</p><p><a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank">You can read the full list of nominees for this year's Grammy Awards here</a>. The ceremony will air on Sunday, February 1, on CBS and Paramount+.</p><hr><p><em>Which soundtracks do you think should have been included in this year's Grammy Awards?
