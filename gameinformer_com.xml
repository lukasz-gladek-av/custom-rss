            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>During a certain period of gaming history, Ace Combat could reliably be expected to appear as a new game on a roughly yearly basis. But as development processes have lengthened, so too has the wait for a new installment in the arcade-style combat flights of the long-running series. That looks like it will change next year, with the reveal of Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve.</p><p>The new, mostly cinematic trailer suggests that the series is adding an increased focus on storytelling and character in this new installment, but it’s clear that the game will also still feature high-speed military jets fighting above the clouds.</p><p>It seems we’ll be waiting a while before we get additional details, but we know that Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is set to lift off in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQYx_867ua0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQYx_867ua0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-takes-flight-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Saros, the new third-person action-shooter from Sony's Housemarque, got a new look at tonight's Game Awards, as well as a new release date of April 30, 2026.</p><p>The trailer shown at The Game Awards 2025 put a spotlight on Arjun Devraj, portrayed by Rahul Kohli, and his crew as they struggle to figure out what's happening on the shifting planet of Carcosa. Housemarque's trademark style and action both look to be on full display here.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Though <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/saros-launches-march-20-on-ps5-first-look-at-gameplay-from-todays-state-of-play/">previously announced for March 20, 2026</a>, it looks like Housemarque is taking a little extra time for its new third-person action romp. What's being shown off right now is already looking great, so here's hoping the extra time gives the team what it needs to stick the landing.</p><p>Saros is up for pre-order now, with 48-hour early access available for Digital Deluxe edition buyers. The quest to survive the foreboding eclipse inside Saros will kick off for PlayStation 5 owners on April 30, 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026]]></content:encoded>
