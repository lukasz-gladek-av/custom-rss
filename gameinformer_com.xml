            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Pragmata captured my attention way back in *checks notes* 2020 (wow). I finally played Pragmata earlier this year at Gamescom and walked away both thoroughly impressed and annoyed with Capcom for making my demo only 20 minutes long. Following a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025, which showed off new gameplay in New York City, an engaging reprieve from the lunar station that’s been heavily showcased so far, Capcom released a demo for the game; it’s basically what I played earlier this year and I can’t recommend it enough. It quickly highlights how unique Pragmata’s gameplay is, which mixes third-person gunplay with real-time hacking minigames.</p><p>“From the start, the core vision was a buddy-action experience where you would control two distinct characters with a single controller,” Pragmata director Yongchee Cho tells me. The team explored giving protagonist Hugh a small drone that aids him in combat, but once the developers landed on the android Diana as a second protagonist, this idea evolved into the hacking system. This created various layers of gameplay that all happen at once, and when coupled with the mysterious narrative and various locales warped and twisted by Luna Filament, the name Pragmata makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The word comes from Greek, meaning things, actions, or facts, and in philosophy, it connects to pragmatism,” Cho tells me. “A single word carrying so many layers of meaning felt like the perfect fit for the story and world of this game.”&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of that Luna Filament, it's the stuff that's causing New York City's Times Square to look so different in the latest Pragmata trailer, and that's not the only location that will be transformed by this mysterious substance. Cho says it's key to the sci-fi world Capcom is creating in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We want players to enjoy diving into the unique sci-fi world that defines Pragmata, and not just the protagonists and their interactions," he says. "You'll come across areas warped by Luna Filament, where strange reactions and irregular structures create an atmosphere that feels both alien and intriguing. The game is full of moments and locales that spark curiosity, whether you're into sci-fi or not, and those surprises run throughout the game.</p><p>"Personally, I can't wait to see the incredible, super-plays players pull off once they get their hands on it."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Those super-plays will be performed throughout Pragmata by the two unlikely protagonists, Hugh and Diana. Cho says Hugh tends to be laid-back and reluctant, but has a strong sense of responsibility. It's no surprise, then, that he teams up with Diana.&nbsp;</p><p>"At first glance, he might seem distant, yet deep down, he's a kind person," Cho adds. "Diana might have felt like a burden early on, but through their explorations of the space station, he gradually starts to see her as someone he truly wants to help. We worked hard to express that side of Hugh's character, not only in dialogue, but also during combat throughout the game."&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, Cho describes Diana as an android girl with vast AI knowledge but little real-world experience, making her a perfect fit for Hugh. "She's full of curiosity about a world she knows almost nothing about," Cho says. "She originally intended to stay on the Moon, but meeting Hugh gives her a new purpose, and she chooses to travel with him. As they journey together, learning from Hugh's experience, Diana becomes increasingly fascinated by Earth and eager to discover more."&nbsp;</p><p>The Moon, Earth, and other settings we'll visit in Pragmata are inspired by all manner of media, Cho tells me. "The character-driven story takes cues from human drama; the visual world borrows ideas from animation and Hollywood films; and the mechanical design and presentation are influenced by Japanese animation," he says. "Of course, it's not just about inspiration. We've blended these influences while preserving the unique atmosphere that makes Pragmata stand apart."&nbsp;</p><p>Pragmata launches in April, so we don't have to wait long to see whether it really stands out from its inspirations. If what we've played so far is any indication – and don't forget, you can check out a Pragmata demo right now – Cho and team are on the right track.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/31/why-im-excited-for-capcoms-weird-and-charming-buddy-action-game-pragmata]]></content:encoded>
