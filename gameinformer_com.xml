            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> had quite the 2024 on PlayStation 5 and PC, and it's set to bring its bullet heaven, bug-killing mayhem to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august">Xbox later this month on August 26</a>. Ahead of the game's launch on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox has released a new "Bring the Boom" trailer highlighting the fun (and explosions) of Helldivers 2, and at the end of it, there seems to be a tease for a Halo 3: ODST collaboration or crossover.&nbsp;</p><p>At roughly 1 minute and 11 seconds in, after the meat and potatoes of the trailer have finished, the video fades away to one of Helldiver 2's cities, moody and atmospheric with rain and few lights on the horizon. Then, the smooth jazz of a saxophone as a Helldiver pod drops into the city. Check it out for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it's pretty clear what Xbox is trying to do here: that's a Halo 3: ODST tease. Sure, Helldivers <em>do </em>drop into cities, but in the game, it's typically not as moody or as ambient as what's pictured here – what <em>is </em>as moody or as ambient as what's here is the atmosphere of Halo 3: ODST. And then the saxophone seals the deal. As for what it means or when we can expect to learn more, that remains unclear. But given Helldivers 2 has crossed over with PlayStation's Killzone series before, it wouldn't be surprising for the game to feature cosmetics or something from one of Xbox's most beloved games.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"><em>Game Informer's </em>Helldivers 2 review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/halo_3_odst/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx"><em>Game Informer's </em>Halo 3: ODST review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the three-player first-person shooter from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/control">Control</a> developer Remedy Entertainment, launched back in June to middling results. Though available on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus on day one, Remedy saw players quickly drop off from the game for various reasons. Now, in <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">Remedy's latest financial results</a>, the company has acknowledged the game's "unsuccessful" launch and plans to turn things around.&nbsp;</p><p>"Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak," the financial results read. "Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/CP3ameICxSk" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CP3ameICxSk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The results go on to explain that FBC: Firebreak was designed to evolve over time and that, despite a rocky launch, Remedy believes it has built a solid foundation. "Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive – showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining. We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop."&nbsp;</p><p>Remedy says looking ahead, a larger "Major Update" late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak, supported by "targeted marketing activities, which we expect will drive interest in the title."&nbsp;</p><p>"We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," Remedy's comments on FBC: Firebreak end.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/yqgJWW1iF0o" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yqgJWW1iF0o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Elsewhere in the financial results, Remedy says <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/31/remedy-provides-update-on-control-2-says-max-payne-remakes-are-in-production">Control 2's</a> development is on track to hit its next milestones, with the focus now on "the gameplay, environments, and missions." <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor">Remedy's Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake project</a> remains in full production, the studio says, and "collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase."&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/control/a-heady-power-trip"><em>Game Informer's </em>Control review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/alan-wake-2/back-to-reality"><em>Game Informer's </em>Alan Wake 2 review</a>.
