            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>This year marks the 15th anniversary for MachinesGames and to celebrate the milestone, the developer is releasing a new update for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> tomorrow, on October 10. It will add the heavily requested New Game+ feature to the game, which includes a new ending sequence, a new but classic Indy outfit, and additional voice-over languages.&nbsp;</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC last December, and it hit PlayStation 5 earlier this year. Players on every platform can expect this free anniversary update tomorrow, and you can get a look at the new features in a special trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, the main highlight of the update is New Game+. Once you've completed the main story, New Game+ will be available right from the main menu. All you have to do is select a save slot containing a completed playthrough of the story, and a New Game+ menu will appear. MachineGames says, "Because you'll be significantly stronger this time around, we recommend bumping your difficulty up," and notes you can adjust this during the initial New Game+ setup.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what carries over, you will have all collected and unlocked Adventure Books as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and Medicine Bottles. If you complete the story in New Game+, you'll unlock a "brand-new ending sequence after the credits," MachineGames says.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the update, you'll receive the new Cairo look from <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. To wear it, just visit the Outfit tab in the Options menu, and you can select the Cairo outfit at any point whenever Indy isn't wearing a disguise.&nbsp;</p>
