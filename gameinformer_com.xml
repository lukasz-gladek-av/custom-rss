Since its release, Naughty Dog has released a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">The Last of Us Part II</a>, a <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/09/the-last-of-us-remake-is-real-and-its-out-this-september">remake</a> of the first game, and all of the first game and some of Part II have been <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2025/05/11/equal-parts-boring-and-intense-visiting-the-set-of-the-last-of-us">adapted for television by HBO</a>.

You can check out the statue in the glamour shots below:&nbsp;</p><p>"Ellie rides atop Callus the horse, wearing her signature striped hoodie and backpack complete with her iconic pins," Dark Horse says of the statue. "Callus is brought to life with stunning details from the worn saddles to the reins, to even the branded 'J' on their leg from Jackson County. Joel walks alongside them, grounded in his rugged gear, rifle gripped in hand and pistol secure in his holster.&nbsp;</p><p>"Together, they tread slowly across a weathered concrete base, including a spray-painted Fireflies symbol, fallen autumn leaves, moss, and the ever-encroaching presence of cordyceps emerging from below."&nbsp;</p><p>The statue stands 13 inches tall, 12 inches wide, and 12.75 inches deep.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
