            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>No matter how you look at it, this was a wild week for the games industry. Electronic Arts, the massive publisher behind multiple sports franchises and BioWare games, has been acquired for $55 billion by an investment consortium that includes the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia; Xbox announced it was overhauling Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and increasing its price by 50%; and Harmonix announced it is delisting Rock Band 4 this Sunday, meaning you only have two days left to buy it before it's gone forever.&nbsp;</p><p>But amidst all that news, <em>Game Informer </em>published reviews for EA Sports FC 26 and Hotel Barcelona, and...we launched The Outer Worlds 2 digital issue!! However, it's Friday and that means it's time for the weekend!</p><p>Like last Friday and the Friday before that and maybe the one before that, too, we're back to give you a selection of games we think you should play this weekend! If you check any of these out, or have suggestions of your own, let us know in the comment section below! Without further ado...</p><h2>Hey Listen*</h2>
