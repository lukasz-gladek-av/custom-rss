            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was the marquee launch title for the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> last summer, and to nobody's surprise, it's the best-selling game on the console. At 14.03 million units sold, including units sold with the Switch 2 bundle that included the game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> is far and away the best-selling software on Nintendo's newest console. In fact, it nearly dwarfs second place by 10 million units.&nbsp;</p><p>That second-place game is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which launched in July, roughly a month after Mario Kart World – 4.25 million units have been sold as of December 31, 2025, according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">Nintendo's latest financial earnings report</a>. Close behind <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/breaking-through-to-something-new">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, at 3.89 million units sold. If you combine <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a/maintaining-rank">Pokémon Legends: Z-A's</a> Switch numbers – 8.41 million units – with its Switch 2 sales, its total sits at 12.3 million units sold, closing in on the Switch 2-exclusive Mario Kart World's total.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSK9ZOh9Wsc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSK9ZOh9Wsc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After Pokémon Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> sits at 1.76 million units sold, with roughly 900,000 of those units (so more than half) sold in Japan – it's clearly a hit there in Nintendo's home country, and notably, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/kirby-air-riders/star-ships-were-meant-to-fly">Kirby Air Riders</a> only launched on November 20 last year, meaning it hasn't even been available for purchase for three months.&nbsp;</p><p>"For software unit sales, Nintendo Switch 2 software totaled 37.93 million units, and Nintendo Switch software declined 12.1% year-on-year to 108.93 million units," the earnings report reads. "The steady increase in unit sales of software has also been enhanced by the wide variety of titles released by software publishers, providing a solid lineup."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ommYYipEGow"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ommYYipEGow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For more from this earnings report, check out this story about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/03/the-switch-is-officially-nintendos-best-selling-console-ever">the Switch is officially Nintendo's best-selling console ever</a>.
