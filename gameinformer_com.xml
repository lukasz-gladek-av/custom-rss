            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Yesterday, The Pokémon Company teased the premiere of some kind of horror-themed video, using the caption "viewer discretion advised." As it aired this morning, we learned that this advisory was, unsurprisingly, a little overkill, as "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident" showed two trainers exploring a dark mansion in the brand's typical G-rated style. Despite that, the video's ending was quite a surprise, as it revealed Victreebel, one of the original 151 Pokémon, will get a mega evolution in Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The video was followed up by a more standard reveal trailer, showcasing the sentient flycatcher bouncing around and chasing smaller monsters around the streets of Lumiose City.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/meet-mega-victreebel-a-newly-discovered-mega-evolved-pokemon-in-pokemon-legends-z-a">A news post on the Pokémon website</a> confirms that Mega Victreebel will keep its Grass/Poison typing, and says that its dizzyingly sweet acid is strong enough to melt through steel. Terrifying!</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f79j5pSboEQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f79j5pSboEQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For more Pokémon Legends Z-A,&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/pokemon-legends-z-a-could-be-the-best-pokemon-game-in-years">check out our hands-on preview from Gamescom</a>, where senior associate editor Wesley LeBlanc wrote that it could be "the best Pokémon game in years."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>NBA 2K26 is right around the corner, and as is often tradition for sports games before launch, developer Visual Concepts is continuing to share what's new with this year's entry. A couple of weeks ago, we learned about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/06/vp-of-development-discusses-presentation-improvements" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9ee9ce3b-f1c9-435b-ab6f-0c654bbb4fde" data-entity-substitution="canonical">a host of presentation upgrades</a> coming to NBA 2K26, and today, 2K released a new post detailing the changes arriving in MyGM and MyNBA, the series' long-term franchise mode. On top of that, we learned who the top-rated players in this year's game at the start of the season will be.</p><p>This year, GMs have a wider array of scenarios that can play out in the 2025 offseason. Once you pick a team, you can choose between three goals that are distinct to that team's roster and history. The tasks can include picking draft picks, signing free agents, or leading your team to the NBA Finals. Some of the scenarios involve building around a number-one draft pick, while others force you to choose between trying to make one more run with your aging superstars or holding a fire sale and starting the rebuild process.</p><p>As you play through MyGM and MyNBA, your achievements will be chronicled through dynamic banners that accurately update based on when you win championships. The experience is also highly customizable, thanks to Unranked MyGM, which lets you edit players, use custom rosters, import custom draft classes, and adjust sliders however you want. With MyPlayer DNA integration, you can even bring your MyPlayer into your franchise experience regardless of your Era.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're more on the managerial side, the simulation mechanics have received various improvements based on player feedback, including giving players greater control over strategic decisions. As GM, you also start each season by meeting with your team's governor to set the budget, goals, and core directives for the upcoming season. These will shape how secure your job is, as well as influence top free agents' decision-making processes. Updating your team facilities can also go a long way to attracting top talent, and you can allocate Facility Points to update team training and recovery facilities, luxury box amenities, and perform arena renovations. Budgets have also been updated to accurately reflect the budgets of specific eras of teams.</p><p>On top of these announcements, we also got a list of the top 10-rated players in NBA 2K26 at the season's start.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets – 98 OVR</li><li>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder – 98 OVR</li><li>Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks – 97 OVR</li><li>Luka Dončić, Los Angeles Lakers – 95 OVR</li><li>Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves – 95 OVR</li><li>Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors – 94 OVR</li><li>LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers – 94 OVR</li><li>Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics – 94 OVR</li><li>Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs – 94 OVR</li><li>Kevin Durant, Houston Rockets – 93 OVR</li></ol><p>NBA 2K26 arrives on September 4.
