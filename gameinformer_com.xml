            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/11/baldurs-gate-3s-final-update-goes-live-next-tuesday<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>Baldur's Gate 3, one of the best games of 2023, is just as popular as ever a year and a half after its full release. In the months since its launch, developer Larian Studios has put out seven major patches to fix bugs, correct errors, and add new content. </span></span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735"><span><span><span><span>Last November, it announced the eighth patch</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, boasting more content than most of the previous patches, would be the final one. Today, the studio announced it goes live on April 17, next Tuesday. To celebrate, Larian will be hosting a live stream on April 16 at 1 PM UTC on its </span></span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/larianstudios"><span><span><span><span>Twitch</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LarianCFH/videos"><span><span><span><span>YouTube channels</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Patch eight will add three major pieces of content. The first, and arguably the most anticipated, is full crossplay between consoles, Mac, and PC. The second addition is a photo mode, a common post-launch feature for modern big-budget games. Players can pose party members, select different lens and filter options, and add frames and stickers to their final photos.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The third addition is the most impactful: twelve new subclasses, one for each class in the game. As always, the classes are pulled from the wide pool of existing character classes in Dungeons &amp; Dragons fifth edition, slightly tweaked to better fit the Baldur's Gate style of play. The subclasses are as follows:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Bard - College of Glamour</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Barbarian - Path of Giants</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Cleric - Death Domain</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Druid - Circle of Stars</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Fighter - Arcane Archer</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Monk - Drunken Master</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Rogue - Swashbuckler</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Warlock - Hexblade</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Wizard - Bladesinging</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Personally, I'm most excited to try an Arcane Archer (a class I don't love in its tabletop iteration) and to see the new animations for the Swarmkeeper Ranger. Patch eight for Baldur's Gate 3 goes live on April 17 on all platforms.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/collectibles/2025/04/11/exclusive-dark-horse-reveals-new-mass-effect-commander-shepard-statues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In cooperation with the original development studio of BioWare, Dark Horse today is revealing two new figure statues as part of its ongoing line of characters from the original trilogy. This time, you can finally snag a representation of your lead character from the story, as the two new figures are the male and female default appearances for Commander Shepard.</p>

<p>Each of the two polyvinyl figures stands nine inches in height and features sculpting and paint by Substance Model Works. Jane Shepard appears with the hard-to-beat Carnifex pistol, a favorite of many Mass Effect players. John Shepard carries an M-8 Avenger and his omni-blade. Both figures join a broader cast of character figures that have already been released in the line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played through multiple runs at Mass Effect over the years with both the male and female versions of the lead, but I always customized my hero away from the default design. Thankfully, I can maintain the illusion of my personal Shepard, as each of the two new figures comes with swappable N7-helmeted heads; in my mind, it will be my version of the iconic character hiding behind the mask.</p>

<p>The new Commander Shepard figures join the line-up in February of 2026, but you can pre-order <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/mass-effect-commander-jane-shepard-figure">Jane</a> or <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/mass-effect-commander-john-shepard-figure">John</a> right now if you want to lock in your purchase. Each figure will run you $69.99.</p>

<p>Check out the gallery below for a close-up look at each of the two figures.&nbsp;</p>
