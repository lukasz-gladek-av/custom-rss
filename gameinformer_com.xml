            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the best perks of owning a Switch 2 is its exclusive <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">GameCube library</a> on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The service launched with three titles, and we’re getting our first new addition in the form of Super Mario Strikers next week.</p><p>Super Mario Strikers originally launched on GameCube in 2005 (making 2025 its 20th anniversary), and is an extreme soccer game starring the cast of the Mushroom Kingdom. The arcade-style sports title sees players executing over-the-top special shots and maneuvers, and features various game modes such as Grudge Match, Cup Battles, and Custom Battles. Like Mario Kart, players can use items such as shells and mushrooms to turn the tide of a match.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's worth noting that Strikers was one of the confirmed "coming soon" titles shown during the GameCube library announcement trailer. Other titles shown that are slated to arrive in the near future (by Switch Online standards) include Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chibi-Robo, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokémon Colosseum.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can play Super Mario Strikers when it arrives on July 3. It joins the already available The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX.
