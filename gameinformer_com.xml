The team urges fans not to purchase any kind of Expedition 33 plush from these sellers as “they could be scams” while waiting for something official.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWUO8e_jtiY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWUO8e_jtiY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We’ve noticed a number of suspicious websites popping up, claiming to sell Esquie plushies.
