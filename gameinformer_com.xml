            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Harmonix has announced that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rock_band_4/b/playstation4/archive/2015/10/05/game-informer-rock-band-4-review.aspx">Rock Band 4</a> is being delisted from digital storefronts due to expiring music licenses. The removal will occur on the day of the game’s 10th anniversary.</p><p>On October 5, Rock Band 4 will be pulled from PlayStation and Xbox digital stores. Harmonix posted a message on its Discord explaining that this is due to the game’s original licenses to the core 65-song soundtrack expiring. Those who own the game will still be able to download and play it, and any purchased music can still be downloaded and played on any compatible devices.</p><p>Here is Harmonix’s full message:</p><p>On Sunday, October 5, 2025, Rock Band 4 turns 10. What a ride it’s been.</p><p>With this milestone comes one big change: the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring. Because of that, Rock Band 4 will be removed from the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores. If you already own the game, nothing changes—you’ll keep full access and still be able to download the game and songs to any new, compatible devices. The same applies to downloadable content: songs will come down as they hit the 10-year mark, but anything you’ve purchased will remain in your library.</p><p>We’re so grateful for the passion this community has shown. From the team, it’s been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep downloadable content library and a best in class band sim. If you’ve been meaning to grab a few last songs, now’s the time. Thanks again,</p><p>—The Rock Band Team</p><p>The move comes after Harmonix <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/01/17/rock-band-4-dlc-ending-this-month">ceased DLC support for Rock Band 4</a> back in January 2024, with over 3,000 songs released weekly since the game's launch on October 6, &nbsp;2015. &nbsp;Rock Band 4 was well-received at launch, scoring an 8.75 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer, </em>and is the final traditional entry in the series, as 2017's&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rock_band_vr/b/oculusrift/archive/2017/04/17/rock-band-vr-game-informer-review.aspx">Rock Band VR</a> followed it. The game received a single paid expansion, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rock_band_4_rivals/b/playstation4/archive/2016/10/17/is-rock-band-4-rivals-worth-buying.aspx">Rock Band 4 Rivals</a>, in October 2016, which added new game modes (including a story mode) and, eventually, additional songs. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite Rock Band as a franchise dominating the early 2010s, the series' availability has gradually diminished due to expiring music licenses and the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/12/14/epic-shutting-down-online-services-for-several-unreal-tournament-and-rock-band-titles">shuttering of online services</a>. We'll be sad to see Rock Band 4 go, but those interested in picking up the game still have time to purchase the $9.99 Rock Band 4 Rivals bundle on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8802-CUSA02084_00-RB4RIVALSGAMEBDL">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/rock-band-4-rivals-bundle/BRS6ZCKHRNVX">Xbox </a>stores before it's pulled for good.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/rock-band-4-will-be-delisted-this-weekend]]></content:encoded>
