            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/21/paul-rudd-returns-in-nintendo-switch-2-ad-34-years-after-his-famous-snes-commercial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In 1991, Nintendo featured an unknown actor named Paul Rudd in its United States launch commercial for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Fast forward to 2025, and Paul Rudd is more than 30 years deep into an acting career that has seen him star in films like <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>, <em>I Love You, Man</em>, and the Ant-Man franchise, as well as fight with Captain America and Iron Man in blockbusters like <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. To pay homage to the now-famous actor’s early work as just a guy who’s Playing with Power, Nintendo brought the movie star back in the first US commercial for Switch 2.</p>

<p><span><span>This commercial's release coincides with the announcement of the United States preorder date, which was initially scheduled for April 9. However, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">tumult surrounding President Trump's tariffs on foreign goods</a> delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in both the United States and Canada. Last week, Nintendo revealed the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0dea30b2-7e9b-43f4-a82e-9a35679b42ca" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">new United States preorder date as April 24</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can see the new Switch 2 commercial starring Paul Rudd below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The ad, which emphasizes the Switch 2's online multiplayer and GameChat social features, plays with the SNES's "Now You’re Playing with Power" tagline. Instead, it uses the line, "Now You’re Playing Together." To provide the context to its YouTube subscribers, Nintendo also uploaded the original 1991 SNES ad featuring Paul Rudd, which you can see below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System arrived on US shelves on August 23, 1991. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5, 2025, with the delayed preorders finally starting this Thursday, April 24.

Following <a href="https://gameinformer.com/node/123750">last week's leak</a>, in which screenshots surfaced, Bethesda's official social media accounts shared an image teasing an announcement tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bethesda took to its accounts on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter to share an image with the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion font with only "IV" displayed and an armored mask in the background. The tweet says, "Tomorrow, 11:00 am EST" and lists URLs to the Bethesda Twitch and YouTube channels. When you visit the YouTube channel, you are greeted by the same art, with a livestream that has the title, "All will be revealed...."</p>

</article><p>The screenshots that hit the Oblivion subreddit last week, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" target="_blank">users started digging into the website files of game development studio Virtuos</a>, potentially indicating that the studio is responsible for the remaster. Immediately following the widely publicized leak, the studio's website was taken offline. Virtuos is a Singapore-based development studio that typically runs support for larger studios or ports the works of other studios to new platforms. Most recently, Virtuos has been assisting Konami with developing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the upcoming remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.</p>

<p>We don't know the platforms or release date of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, but widespread speculation is that it will release very soon on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, we will not know for sure until tomorrow when the livestream occurs at 11 am Eastern / 8 am Pacific. To watch it live, you can head to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p>
