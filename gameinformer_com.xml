Sumo Digital acquired the developer in August 2018 for £2.2 million, and now The Chinese Room is independent once again.</p><p>This weekend, The Chinese Room completed a management buyout, with the company to be led by current studio director Ed Daly. This deal was facilitated by VC firm Hiro Capital, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened">according to&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it also resulted in layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, following the divestment process a number of roles were made redundant," Daly told&nbsp;Eurogamer. "The specifics are confidential but the studio is currently 55 developers. Clearly this was a very difficult process as we sought a future for the studio outside of Sumo."</p><p>The Chinese Room also announced it's actively working on two new IPs. "We had been working on new IP that needed investment and that was no longer possible with Sumo's new model," Daly told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>In the immediate future, The Chinese Room is planning to release Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 this October, and&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/16/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-game-informers-next-cover-story">it's the game on the cover of&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em>'s next issue</a>, out tomorrow.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital"><em>IGN</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-heres-how-it-happened"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/21/bloodlines-2-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-cuts-ties-with-parent]]></content:encoded>
