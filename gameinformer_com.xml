            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Since its announcement in 2017, we have been patiently waiting for Witchbrook, the next game from Chucklefish. You might recognize them as the developers known for Starbound and Wargroove, but they also published big indie hits like Stardew Valley, giving us plenty of reasons to be excited. Luckily, the latest Nintendo Direct not only gave us a fresh look at the magically collegiate adventure but also gave us a launch window: holiday 2025.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWDGCwFZMbk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Witchbrook is a cozy life-sim where players embody a student at the titular magical college. As you take classes and learn spells, you'll be able to bring them into other areas of life, like selling magical decorations at a stand in the town square. Players can also explore the town of Mossport to get jobs, make money, and meet up with their friends. It's all showcased through a cute, isometric, pixelated art style.</p>

<p>The trailer featured cozy mechanics galore. In addition to the aforementioned shop mechanic, you can use a telescope to read the stars, deliver mail to townsfolk, and rearrange your living quarters by using levitation spells to move furniture. The game also supports up to 4-player online co-op, which the new video showcases through footage of four people flying across the town on their brooms. At a different point, we see someone also driving a moped, which seems objectively inferior to a flying broom, but I'll leave the magic to the students of Witchbrook.</p>

<p>A moped? Really?</p>

</article><p>While the trailer was specifically for the Switch version, the game is also headed to Xbox and PC. You can take classes, learn spells, and socialize with your fellow students on the platform of your choice when Witchbrook launches this holiday season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-battle-zones-and-the-z-a-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After the Pokémon Presents earlier this year, we got our first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A, including gameplay, new characters, and the game's selection of starters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9OqoRxXUjGA">Today's Nintendo Direct</a> gave us just a bit more information, specifically explaining what the deal was with the mysterious teaser at the end of the previous trailers.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A is the second of a new style of mainline Pokémon games, with a free third-person camera, an open world, and revamped combat. While Legends Arceus took place in an ancient Sinnoh region, Legends Z-A is a return to the Kalos region from Pokémon X&amp;Y, allowing players to see what happened after that game's campaign. Given that those titles are the only mainline Pokémon games without sequels or DLC, it's been a highly anticipated return.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tezs2FsIxgA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes place entirely within Lumiose City, a huge Paris-like metropolis with multiple districts. Wild Pokémon will now appear in Wild Zones, closed-off areas within the city where the creatures are able to live peaceful lives undisturbed. While this feature appeared in the Pokémon Presents trailer, we only saw what the areas were like during the day. Today's Nintendo Direct revealed they're a bit different once the sun goes down.</p>

<p>At night, Battle Zones appear. While Wild Zones have an inviting green entrance, the Battle Zones are an aggressive red-orange and are full of trainers looking for challengers. Collectively, these encounters are known as the Z-A Royale, a competition where a trainer makes their way from Rank Z to Rank A. Rules here are similar to other games – eye contact with a trainer forces you into a battle – but the new action-based battle system allows for alternate approaches too, like the ability to ambush a trainer with an attack before they see you.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6e7b3bea-04e4-45bc-91f0-8f11d4375674" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Reach Rank A, and you'll "have a wish granted," though it's not entirely clear who grants the wish and how far their powers go. Examples in the trailer include a taxi driver hoping to abolish all public transit except taxis and a woman hoping the city will host a marathon, so don't go into it expecting to solve world hunger or anything.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Battle Zones raises many questions. When you lose, do you drop ranks? How often can we battle in the daylight, outside of Battle Zones? Who's hosting the Z-A Royale to begin with? We'll have answers once Pokémon Legends Z-A drops on Switch in late 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/tomodachi-life-returns-after-10-years-with-new-entry-living-the-dream<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo released Tomodachi Life in 2013 for 3DS – a quirky and, frankly, bizarre virtual social sim that gained a cult following in the years since. Cries of “bring back Tomodachi Life” have been answered with the reveal of Living The Dream, a new installment coming next year.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dvo1V7DWYsA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Like the first game, Living the Dream lets players create Mii characters and watch them live their lives, only this time the game takes place on a tropical island. The game’s charm once again comes from the strange interactions that can unfold between your Mii and those of your friends. From furiously lobbing random objects at each other to even invading each other's dreams in funny/terrifying ways (like becoming a giant), the series' trademark wackiness (including its text-to-speech style voiceovers) seems preserved and dialed up a few degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches on Switch in 2026. You can check out our review of Tomodachi Life <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/tomodachi_life/b/3ds/archive/2014/06/06/tomodachi-life-review.aspx">here</a>.</p>
