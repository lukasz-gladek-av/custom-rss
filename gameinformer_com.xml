While the studio claimed it was working on an action adventure game, we didn't have any more details until today, when Wizards of the Coast announced its partnership with the developer on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game via a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement includes a quote from John Hight, who is currently the president of Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming, but worked with Asmussen on the God of War series in the late '00s. "I’m so happy to be reuniting with him on this new project,” Hight says of Asmussen. “In our time working together on God of War I got to see firsthand Stig’s artistry and expertise, and he and the Giant Skull team are the perfect fit for our new game."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Details on the game itself are scant, but it's confirmed to be a single-player action-adventure title in development for PC and console. Given Asmussen's experience with the Star Wars: Jedi and God of War series, it seems firmly in his comfort zone. While it's just speculation, we would not be surprised to see a game starring D&amp;D legend Drizzt Do'Urden and his twin scimitars a la Cal Kestis or Kratos. Regardless, it seems likely that this will be Asmussen's second game series involving force damage.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are other D&amp;D games in production, Wizards of the Coast is likely seeking a new long-term partnership after it and Larian parted ways following the success of Baldur's Gate 3. While there's no telling how the development cycle will shake out, we were huge fans of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and even bigger fans of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/19/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2023#:~:text=6-,Star%20Wars%20Jedi%3A%20Survivor,-In%20many%20ways">one of our favorite games of 2023</a>, so this seems like a promising collaboration.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Plus, the patch features a large list of bug fixes, too.</p><p>Nightreign launched last week, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-hits-2-million-players-in-just-one-day">bringing in an impressive 2 million players in less than 24 hours</a>. It didn’t take long for players to realize embarking on solo expeditions is incredibly difficult, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">something I noted in my Nightreign review</a>. Publisher Bandai Namco announced last week that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-coming-next-week-to-make-solo-expeditions-easier">an upcoming patch would address that</a>, and now that <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">patch</a> is live.</p><p height="360" width="640"

allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For solo players, the patch adds the “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat” effect, which allows revival once per night boss battle, to the game and increases the amount of runes gained.</p><p>General balance adjustments that all players will feel are an increase in the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward when reaching Day 3 of any expedition, and an increase in the probability of obtaining high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar in the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>Elsewhere in the patch, From Software has fixed a large number of bugs, which you can view below:</p><ul><li>Adjusted camera behavior when activating the Guardian's Ultimate Art, “Wings of Salvation.”</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Duchess's Character Skill “Restage” where Status Ailments would not trigger when built up from other players' attacks.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks of Raider with Greataxe and Great Hammer weapon types had higher damage than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some “Those Who Live in Death “ enemies would revive when &nbsp;defeated with the “Sacred Blade” skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the “Bleeding” Status Ailment would not build up when the Skill “Bloody Slash” hit an enemy.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the “Ghostflame Ignition” attack would not occur under certain circumstances.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the status ailment “Frostbite” would not build up when the light wave released by a strong attack hit an enemy while the “Moonlight Greatsword” skill was active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the speed of arrows fired with the “Mighty Shot” and “Enchanted Shot” skills was slower than expected.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the attack range of the magic spell “Rock Sling” was longer than expected when using it with a staff equipped in the left hand.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the effect of reducing the maximum HP of enemies when the incantation “Black Blade” hit them was not activated.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Passive Effect "Successive Attacks Negate Damage" &nbsp;would stack when successive attacks were made while the Effect was active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some Passive Effects were not displaying their effects at the correct values.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Relic Special Effect “[Guardian] Become the target of enemy aggression when ability is activated” would not activate under certain situations.</li><li>Fixed a bug where certain effects were not being applied to Relics obtained from Expedition Rewards or purchased from the Small Jar Bazaar.</li><li>Fixed a bug where items that could be obtained upon completing a Remembrance in the Remembrance world when the scenario conditions were met could not be obtained when changing characters and concluding a Remembrance.</li><li>Fixed bugs in the behavior and specifications of certain attacks and actions of specific enemies.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused the game to become unstable under certain conditions during battles with specific enemies.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the graphics rendering during battles with specific enemies.</li><li>Fixed some incorrect information in the staff credits.</li><li>Fixed some text.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some sound effects were not playing correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the “Exit Remembrance” effect was not displayed during a “Wylder” Remembrance on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the HUD was not displayed on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the game would crash under certain circumstances on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Expeditions and reconnecting to sessions would fail under certain circumstances on some platforms.</li><li>Fixed a bug where background music

“Graphics” (Steam only).</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Climb up action sometimes failed when using the keyboard (Steam only).</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Climb up action was difficult to perform when using a gamepad (Steam only).</li></ul><p>This update, Ver. 1.01.1, is available now and is required for anyone wishing to play Nightreign online.</p><p>While waiting for the game to update, read
