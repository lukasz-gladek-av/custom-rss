            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has updated the library of games in its SNES portion of Nintendo Switch Online, but one addition is more significant than most. Mario &amp; Wario, a 1993 puzzle spin-off of both the Mario and Wario series has come west for the first time in history. It's joined by two other games, Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Fatal Fury Special, and you can check out all three in the video below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13ieq0wTB2E"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13ieq0wTB2E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mario &amp; Wario was developed by Game Freak, a studio primarily known for its world-famous Pokémon series. In fact, much of the team behind Pokémon Red, Blue, and Green is credited on Mario &amp; Wario as well; both games are directed by Satoshi Tajiri, feature art from Ken Sugimori, and include music from Junichi Masuda. In the game, you control a fairy named Wanda who helps Mario navigate various obstacles while his eyes are covered with Wario's various traps, including barrels and giant eggshells.</p><p>Like Mario Paint, Mario &amp; Wario uses a mouse peripheral as its main controller, and the player clicks the screen to manipulate the environment and safely bring Mario to his goal. On Switch 2, you can use a Joy-Con 2 to play, but for Switch 1, you'll need a USB mouse plugged into the console.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind is the first in the Bubsy series, a mascot platformer from 1993. While modern attempts to revive the character have been largely unsuccessful, this first outing was received very well, with Game Informer's staff at the time giving it an average score of 8.75 <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/9-bubsy-in-claws-encounters-of-the-furred-kind">and putting it on the cover of our ninth issue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Fatal Fury Special, on the other hand, is an enhanced version of Fatal Fury II, including more characters and faster animations. All three games are available on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 1 and 2 starting today.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>This year marks the 15th anniversary for MachinesGames and to celebrate the milestone, the developer is releasing a new update for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> tomorrow, on October 10. It will add the heavily requested New Game+ feature to the game, which includes a new ending sequence, a new but classic Indy outfit, and additional voice-over languages.&nbsp;</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC last December, and it hit PlayStation 5 earlier this year. Players on every platform can expect this free anniversary update tomorrow, and you can get a look at the new features in a special trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, the main highlight of the update is New Game+. Once you've completed the main story, New Game+ will be available right from the main menu. All you have to do is select a save slot containing a completed playthrough of the story, and a New Game+ menu will appear. MachineGames says, "Because you'll be significantly stronger this time around, we recommend bumping your difficulty up," and notes you can adjust this during the initial New Game+ setup.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what carries over, you will have all collected and unlocked Adventure Books as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and Medicine Bottles. If you complete the story in New Game+, you'll unlock a "brand-new ending sequence after the credits," MachineGames says.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the update, you'll receive the new Cairo look from <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. To wear it, just visit the Outfit tab in the Options menu, and you can select the Cairo outfit at any point whenever Indy isn't wearing a disguise.&nbsp;</p>
