Rise of Hydra, which is led by Amy Hennig of Jak and Daxter and Uncharted fame, was initially set to launch sometime this year.</p><p>While this delay is likely disappointing for Marvel fans excited about the single-player action-adventure team-up of Captain America and Black Panther Azurri (T'Challa's grandfather) during World War II, it’s not too surprising. The last time we heard about this game was in March of 2024, when Skydance released the first <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-skydances-captain-americablack-panther-game-arriving-next">cinematic trailer</a> for the game.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have an important update: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early&nbsp; 2026,” a statement from Skydance Games posted to X reads. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!”&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>You can learn more about what Skydance has planned for Marvel 1943 Rise of Hydra by reading our 2022 interview While waiting to learn more about what Skydance is cooking up for Rise of Hydra, check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/28/the-league-of-upcoming-superhero-games"><em>Game Informer’s</em> list of upcoming superhero games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
