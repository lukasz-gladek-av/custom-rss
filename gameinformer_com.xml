While the number of employees laid off earlier this month and this week remains unknown, one former developer posted a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yiyiwzhang.bsky.social/post/3m4dxhba5ds2x">video</a> explaining that Heart Machine, which crafted the well-received Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, laid off a "bunch more people, effective immediately," adding that by the time Possessor(s) launches next month, they aren't sure if anyone who actually worked on the game will still be at Heart Machine.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzAy9k9fvCk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzAy9k9fvCk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The hearts of <em>Game Informer </em>are with everyone affected by these Heart Machine layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch"><em><strong>Game Developer</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/30/report-heart-machine-is-laying-off-employees-a-second-time-this-month-weeks-before-its]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Paramount, the movie and television studio behind <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and the now-canceled <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/07/19/paramount-cancels-halo-series-after-two-seasons"><em>Halo</em></a><em> </em>live-action series, announced in September that it was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/02/paramount-and-activision-strike-deal-to-make-call-of-duty-movie">partnering with Activision to create a Call of Duty film</a>. Now, Paramount has revealed that Peter Berg (<em>Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor</em>, <em>Deepwater Horizon</em>, <em>Patriots Day</em>) will direct the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>Berg will also write and produce the movie alongside Taylor Sheridan, who has also been tapped to write and produce it. Sheridan is behind other Paramount series, including&nbsp;<em>Yellowstone</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tulsa King</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Landman</em>, among others. Joining these two is David Glasser, who will produce the movie.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>A press release states that, in addition to being longtime friends, Berg and Sheridan have collaborated on projects such as <em>Hell or High Water</em>, which received four Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Screenplay. The duo also worked together on <em>Wind River</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>There's still no word on which direction this Call of Duty film adaptation will take, but given the game series' various settings —World War 2, the Vietnam War, a sci-fi future, and more — there's plenty to work with. However, it's easy to see how a Modern Warfare-style film would work, given Berg's prior work. Only time will tell.</p><p>In the meantime, check out <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/19/days-of-future-past">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 preview</a>, and then check out the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/the-next-call-of-duty-is-black-ops-7-and-it-features-a-co-op">cinematic reveal trailer for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, which <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arrives-on-november-14-beta-slated-for-october">launches on November 14</a>.
