The Crimson Wings must answer a call for help, and a new playable character, The White Wolf, will join them. The expansion features new equipment and items, new minigames, plus over 40 new monsters you’ll battle to the tune of 15 new music tracks by composer Eddie Marianukroh.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3ky84QJcxw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3ky84QJcxw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It’s exciting to see Chain of Echoes get a big expansion like this, years after its initial launch. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/chained-echoes/old-style-new-ideas">We scored the game an 8.75 out of 10</a>, with <em>Game Informer</em> editor-in-chief Matt Miller writing in his review, “Whether you currently count yourself a JRPG connoisseur or fondly recall the ʼ90s heyday of the genre, Chained Echoes is well worth your time.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ashes of Elrant will be available for each version of Chained Echoes on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The price of the DLC has not been disclosed.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/26/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-lands-in-august]]></content:encoded>
