After departing Respawn, the team began work on a new shooter called Highguard.</p><p>The fast-paced gameplay seems to mix mount riding, gun-shooting, power usage, and area capture into an intoxicating mix.</p><p>The debut trailer isn’t what many have come to expect from game reveals, as it was mostly focused on showing off gameplay. That’s likely because the game is surprisingly close to launch, and is set to release in January.</p><p>It’s unclear at this juncture precisely how the game mixes storytelling and worldbuilding with multiplayer elements, but much of the gameplay does appear to be competitive in nature.</p><p>Highguard is set to launch as a free-to-play title on January 26, 2026, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs]]></content:encoded>
