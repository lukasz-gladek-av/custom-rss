We've been hard at work getting our feet back under us, making lots of behind-the-scenes efforts on the website, and working toward bringing back the physical magazine. It's kept us busy!</p><p>But ahead of the magazine officially returning, Summer Game Fest activities, and the launch of Switch 2, we wanted to make sure we had an outlet to share our conversations and have you listen in. Alex Van Aken, Marcus Stewart, Charles Harte, and I have the first episode in the can where we talk about the shutdown and how it affected us, what we've been playing, and lots more.</p><p>That episode isn't available <em>quite</em> yet, but we wanted to make sure you know where to subscribe to the show when the first episode drops on Friday, June 6.</p><p>You can find some direct links below or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gameinformer">watch a video version of the podcast on our YouTube channel</a>. You can also search for The Game Informer Show wherever you listen to podcasts.</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback!</p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-game-informer-show/id335246945">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2EWTEHrbZpNRAboYLimAhu">Spotify</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
