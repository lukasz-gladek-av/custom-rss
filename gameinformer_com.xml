The new studio debuted today, with a stated focus on "advancing the rhythm game genre."</p><p>If RedOctane conjures memories of plastic guitars for you, it should; RedOctane was the moniker for brothers Charles and Kai Huang's rhythm game studio, one half of the partnership (alongside Harmonix Music Systems) that brought Guitar Hero to the world. According to the studio's press release, the new RedOctane Games will have Charles and Kai Huang on a special advisory board. Simon Ebejer, the production director on several Guitar Hero games at Neversoft, is also at the helm as studio head.</p><p>"Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay theyâ€™re about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other," said Ebejer in a statement. "RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMpdAXrO3tk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMpdAXrO3tk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>RedOctane Games is apparently already underway with its rhythm-focused goals, as the team has already gone through pre-production and entered production on its debut rhythm-based game, which will be announced later this year.</p><p>The new RedOctane Games exists within Freemode, one of the Embracer Group's subsidiaries, alongside the likes of Limited Run Games and Middle-Earth Enterprises.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/06/redoctane-games-is-a-new-rhythm-game-studio-founded-by-guitar-hero-veterans]]></content:encoded>
