<p>Beginning today, those playing the PS4 or Xbox One versions of Far Cry 4 on their PS5 Pro, PS5, Xbox Series X, or Xbox Series S will experience the open-world action title in 60 frames per second. On top of that, Ubisoft also announced that Far Cry 4 is coming to Game Pass for Xbox, PC, and cloud "very soon." It is also currently offering a deep discount on PlayStation until May 7 ($5) and the Ubisoft Store until May 20 ($6).</p>

<p>Far Cry 4 was released on November 18, 2014, for PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. This update affects only the PS4 and Xbox One versions when played on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, respectively.

<p><em>Bloomberg</em>&nbsp;also reports that one of the two incubation projects Respawn has canceled was an extraction shooter set within the Titanfall universe. As an incubation project, the title was very early in development. EA issued a statement about the layoffs, saying in part:</p>

<p>"These decisions aren’t easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected – their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today. We’re offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA."</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Original Story:</strong> </em>Respawn Entertainment, the developer behind Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars Jedi series, has announced layoffs due to internal changes to its development pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">statement</a>, the developer says it is making “adjustments” to its Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi teams, the latter of which is currently working on a follow-up to 2023’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>. The developer has also ceased development of two “early-stage incubation projects.”</p>

<p>These changes have resulted in layoffs for an unknown number of staff. Respawn states it will offer “meaningful support” to affected employees, including finding new opportunities within publisher EA.</p>

<p>“Looking ahead, our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged,” says Respawn. “Innovation has always been at the core of Respawn’s identity, and it continues to drive how we build the future – from evolving live experiences to crafting new worlds and stories.”</p>

While we are still awaiting the next installment in George R. R. Martin's book series, the HBO series ended in 2019.&nbsp;<em>House of the Dragon</em>&nbsp;still gives fans plenty of time in Westeros, but for those who want to interact with their favorite characters from&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, Warner Bros. and Netmarble have announced a May 21 release date for their upcoming action/RPG, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad.</p>

<p>Announced during The Game Awards 2024, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad allows you to craft your own story during the events of the main&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>story. Netmarble pitches this as a way to deepen the lore surrounding&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, as Kingsroad is a story-rich experience where you visit iconic locations and interact with several of the most recognizable characters from the popular series. Players can select from different classes, including Knight, Sellsword, and Assassin, each with its strengths, weaknesses, and distinct mechanics.</p>

<p>You can see the full launch date trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nKREX6YeCY" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>It is currently in an abbreviated Early Access state on Steam, which began in March. As of now, with over 1,000 user reviews, the game has "Mixed" reception. In the Early Access build, players start in the North, able to explore locations like Castle Black, Winterfell, and beyond The Wall, or head south to areas like King's Landing and Highgarden, through 50 chapters of the main story. The full version includes more areas, including the Stormlands, plus more open-world content and additional quests. The Early Access version currently costs $25, but Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will become free to play following the full version's launch.</p>

<p>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's full version launches on PC, iOS, and Android on May 21.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4s-release-date-moved-forward-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Borderlands 4 is getting a State of Play presentation tomorrow, April 30. We also learned that the game’s September 23 release date has been moved forward by over a week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Borderlands 4 State of Play airs at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET and will run for 20 minutes. The presentation will be hosted by Gearbox creative director Graeme Timmins and senior project producer Anthony Nicholson to provide a guided look at gameplay. Expect to see the game’s new weapons, returning characters, and Action Skills, among other features.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26vY2GMfYTw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game’s launch date has been bumped up to September 12. The announcement was seemingly posted earlier than intended, with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lnxicudw3e2c">video</a> of Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford announcing the date that was quickly taken down before Gearbox officially revealed the news about an hour later. Regardless, it’s always nice to see a game arrive earlier than expected rather than being delayed.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 was first revealed at Gamescom 2024. Set on the planet Kairos, players control four new Vault Hunters to hunt for riches while battling the planet’s tyrannical dictator, the Timekeeper. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A Switch 2 version is slated to arrive sometime this year.&nbsp;</p>
