Oddly quiet for the site of a glamorous party just hours before, the house is now populated by figures that seem to turn up where you least expect them. As you advance toward the heart of the mansion, the fate of your friend rests in your hands.”</p><p>You can check out the Dead Take teaser for yourself below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VKPIPgenk8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VKPIPgenk8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There’s no release date for Dead Take yet, but Pocketpair Publishing says it will launch this year.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau/spirit-over-substance"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>, and then check out our list of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/10/31/the-top-25-horror-games-of-all-time.aspx">the top 25 best horror games of all time</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Have you played Tales of Kenzera: Zau?

Today, publisher Bandai Namco revealed the player count has leaped to 3.5 million alongside news that duo expeditions are coming to the game in the future.</p><p>The team also says that in addition to DLC releasing later this year, new things will be added to Nighreign, like enhanced boss fights against Nightlords starting this month.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“On the dawn of the fifth day, 3.5 million Nightfarers took up arms against the Night in Elden Ring Nightreign. We are ever grateful for your passion,” a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">post</a> from the Elden Ring X account reads. “But the night is far from over. In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support.”</p><p>Confirming that duo expeditions are coming to Nightreign is exciting, especially as matchmaking for trios is tough, and playing solo is even tougher. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/02/new-elden-ring-nightreign-patch-makes-solo-play-easier-alongside-balance-changes-and-bug">From Software released a patch yesterday</a> that should make the latter easier, though.</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>, and then check out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/tips-tricks/2025/05/29/elden-ring-nightreign-beginner-tips-and-tricks"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign beginner tips and tricks</a>.
