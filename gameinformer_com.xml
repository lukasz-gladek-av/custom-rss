Last month, we learned <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/mega-victreebel-is-coming-to-pokemon-legends-z-a">Mega Victreebel</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/mega-hawlucha-is-the-latest-mega-evolution-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a">Mega Hawlucha</a> are coming to the game, and now, Game Freak has revealed that Mega Malamar is the latest Mega-evolution joining the Pokémon Legends: Z-A roster.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Malamar was first revealed today in a "Special Report" on the official Pokémon YouTube channel, in which we learn about some strange behavior happening in Lumiose City, the setting for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and how a Malamar capable of Mega-evolution might be behind the occurrences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the video below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4HxSr_6RiiY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4HxSr_6RiiY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, Mega Malamar just wants to be your friend. There's absolutely nothing terrifying or suspicious about that. Just let Mega Malamar into your life.&nbsp;</p><p>Game Freak states that Mega-evolution causes Malamar's brain to enlarge and its body to glow brightly in vivid colors, allowing it to release psychic power from the luminescent tips of its tentacles and hypnotize others. It can even stick its tentacles to its head to stimulate its brain for a rapid boost of psychic power, according to Game Freak.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here's a look at Mega Malamar in Pokémon Legends: Z-A:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mega Malamar will be one of the various Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A when it launches on Switch 2 and Switch next month on October 26.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVsU1SDm1M">New Gameplay Today</a> abou<a href="https://gameinformer.com/ngt/2025/09/01/pokemon-legends-z-a-could-be-the-best-new-pokemon-in-years-new-gameplay-today">t why Pokémon Legends: Z-A might be the best Pokémon game in years</a>, and then check out <em>Game Informer's</em> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/26/lighting-up-lumiose">hands-on preview of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of Mega Malamar's design?
