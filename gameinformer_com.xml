Furthermore, the game is also launching on Switch 2.</p><p>First revealed nearly a year ago last June, this, like the previous Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, is a complete overhaul of the original two Dragon Quest titles, which are bundled together in one package. Chronologically, these adventures occur after Dragon Quest III’s events (hence why Square released it first), continuing the Erdrick saga as players control his descendants. However, both games will feature new story elements.</p><p>Outside of the HD-2D graphical facelift, the battle system has been refined, and the games include quality-of-life updates. Square Enix also teases new content for both titles and plans to provide specific details later.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_-SwBuzZE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_-SwBuzZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you want all three Dragon Quest remakes in one package, Square is launching a digital-only bundle called Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection on the same day for $99.99. Additionally, players can also purchase the Dragon Quest 1 &amp; II HD-2D Remake Collector’s Edition for $149.99. It contains the following bonus items:</p><p><strong>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake Standard Edition physical game</strong></p><p><strong>Dragon Quest I &amp; II Character &amp; Monster Blocks Complete Set</strong></p><ul><li>Including six characters, a dog, two boss monsters, and logo</li></ul><p><strong>The Outstanding Outfit Kit (Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake in-game items)</strong></p><ul><li>Ring of Strength x1</li><li>Slime Earrings x1</li><li>Mad Cap x1</li><li>Arriviste’s Vest x1</li></ul><p><strong>Exclusive digital wallpapers x2</strong><br><strong>Pre-order bonus</strong></p><p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.
