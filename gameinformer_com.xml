Towerborne comes from Stoic, the studio behind The Banner Saga series.</p><p>The news was announced during yesterday's New Game+ Showcase. Towerborne first entered Steam Early Access in September 2024 and Xbox Game Preview in April 2025. It is a co-op fantasy action RPG in the vein of a classic beat ‘em up. Players control an immortal warrior named Ace who must defend the land against a deadly corruption while solving the mystery of a crumbling city. The side-scrolling combat emphasizes combo-heavy melee action, and Ace can be customized with gear that alters your playstyle.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V304dd9HZj0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V304dd9HZj0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Towerborne first launched in Early Access, it was billed as a free-to-play, always-online title. Stoic has since reworked the game into a traditional paid experience that can be played offline, though it supports online co-op. Additionally, paid cosmetics have been removed; players now unlock cosmetics for free by playing, and new items will be added in the 1.0 version.</p><p>The 1.0 update also features a completed main story, two new bosses, new gear/player abilities, a reworked difficulty system including a new Brutal difficulty setting, and an updated world map. The final version of Towerborne also boasts new music from famed composer Austin Wintory</p><p>Towerborne launches in full on February 26, and it will debut on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox Series X/S and PC. The Standard Edition is $24.99. The Deluxe Edition, which includes two cosmetic sets, crafting materials, and more, is $29.99.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/09/towerborne-the-action-rpg-by-the-makers-of-the-banner-saga-launches-out-of-early-access]]></content:encoded>
