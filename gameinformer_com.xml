Not only that, but the game is getting a new story expansion called Dark Ties.</p><p>The two experiences will be bundled together in a package dubbed Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties. Kiwami 3, like the previous titles, is a ground-up remake of Yakuza 3 that features improved graphics and reworked brawling gameplay, such as the ability to swap between two fighting styles.</p><p>The first fighting style is Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami, a brawling style boasting the largest number of attack techniques in the series’ history. Second is Ryukyu Style, a new addition described as a technical weapon-based style that lets players unleash combos using eight different weapons.</p><p>Kiwami 3 also features a new team battle mode called Legendary Baddie, Bad Boy Dragon. Players work together to build a biker gang to fight alongside the Ryukyu Gal Gang of female bikers to protect Okinawa.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9rjoTdG_M"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9rjoTdG_M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dark Ties is a standalone story expansion starring Yakuza 3 antagonist Yoshitaka Mine. Set in Kamurocho, it serves as a prequel to Yakuza 3’s events that tells Mine’s origin story and how and why he joined the yakuza.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Mine’s combat centers on boxing and his Dark Awakening ability, a mode where he unleashes his inner darkness to wreak havoc on enemies with a ruthless assault. Dark Ties also features Hells Arena, an underground fight club where players can battle opponents under various rules. Survival Hell mode tasks players with fighting through an underground dungeon to reach a goal at the end.</p><p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties launches on February 12, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, and PC.
