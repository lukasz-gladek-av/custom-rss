            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/10/vampire-survivors-announces-crossover-with-square-enixs-saga-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After making waves in late 2022, the wildly popular Vampire Survivors has continued adding a ton of new and crossover content to the overall package. Developer Poncle has already added content from the likes of Castlevania, Contra, and Among Us, and now, it has struck a deal with a new publisher to include content from one of its long-running franchises. As a result, starting today, players can brave the undead hordes as characters from Square Enix's SaGa franchise.</p>

<p>Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama joins the ever-growing Poncle package today, adding characters from Square Enix's SaGa franchise, in particular, SaGa Emerald Beyond. According to Poncle, the SaGa characters can stand alongside the Vampire Survivors. This free content drop adds more than 40 new attacks, 16 playable characters and skins, and a new stage with seven distinct biomes to explore.</p>

<p>While this announcement is squarely focused on SaGa, the newly forged partnership with Square Enix (and the fact that its deal with Konami led to content from multiple franchises) hopefully leads to more collaborations with the iconic publisher, as its other franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts would also make great additions to the Vampire Survivors roster. The Emerald Dioarama expansion is available now for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS (excluding the Apple Arcade version), and Android.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/10/blazblue-entropy-effect-getting-dead-cells-crossover-couch-co-op<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>More than a year after release, BlazBlue Entropy Effect, an action-packed side-scrolling roguelite featuring characters from the mainline BlazBlue franchise, receives a hefty update. This summer, players can expect a new way to play with friends, as well as the addition of a new playable character from another side-scrolling roguelite, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dead-cells/one-of-the-best-roguelikes-to-date">Dead Cells</a>.</p>

<p>While we don't have much in the way of details, during today's Triple-i Initiative stream, developer/publisher 91Act announced that a couch co-op and a free playable character from the Dead Cells universe will be arriving this summer. The Dead Cells character joins the 11 preexisting characters already in playable in the BlazBlue Entropy Effect roster. You can see the full teaser, which also serves as an accolades trailer, below.</p>
