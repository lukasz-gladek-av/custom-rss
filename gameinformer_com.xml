The game has been widely praised for its immersive (and challenging) gameplay, exploration, and storytelling. We awarded the game a 9.5 out of 10 in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/a-medieval-day-epic">our review</a>, with editor Wesley LeBlanc saying, “KCD2 is challenging, demanding, and often unforgiving. But, like the sharp blades I smithed in-game, through fire, it forges an exciting, surprising, and unforgettable fable.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/06/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-on-xbox-and-steam]]></content:encoded>
