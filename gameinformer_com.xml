            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Capcom released a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem">new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem during The Game Awards 2025</a>, and it featured <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/09/resident-evil-requiem-storefronts-accidentally-leak-two-unannounced-characters">the return of Leon S. Kennedy to the series</a>, older and more grizzly than we've ever seen him. Following that trailer, Capcom spoke with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/"><em>Automaton</em></a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna"><em>IGN</em></a>, to discuss this beloved character's return, how much we can expect of him in Requiem, and his fancy new Porsche.&nbsp;</p><p>Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi told <em>Automaton</em> that Leon and Grace will share the game's runtime equally. "In terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon's playable sections are almost equally split," Nakanishi said. "The structure is similar to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/resident_evil_revelations/b/pc/archive/2013/05/19/the-right-way-to-play-this-missing-chapter.aspx">Resident Evil Revelations</a>."&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/rVIIcLGGO7A" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVIIcLGGO7A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nakanishi added that Requiem is Leon's first return to Raccoon City since his time in Resident Evil 2, "so seeing how he responds to the 'place where it all began' now that he's older is another major point of interest." In terms of designing this more gruff Leon for Requiem, the director said, "Although he's a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him to be an 'ikeoji' [a cool/attractive guy]," adding that the reaction to this new trailer made the development team happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview with <em>Automaton</em>, Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa detailed Leon's fancy new ride: a Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. Kumazawa said, "We were looking for a car that fit Leon, and thankfully, Porsche kindly agreed, which led to a full collaboration." The Requiem producer says this Porsche is a custom-built Cayenne Turbo GT meant to fit the game's world, adding that "it's a one-of-a-kind car."&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Kepler Interactive and newcomer developer Shapefarm have revealed Orbitals, a co-op puzzle adventure inspired by classic anime. The gorgeous reveal trailer also reveals that Orbitals will launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Shapefarm is based in Tokyo, Japan, so it's no wonder Orbitals is a clear love letter to 1990s anime, like <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, and others. In the game, players will team up as Maki and Omura, two inseparable explorers who must brave the perils of space to save the crumbling space station they call home from a supernatural cosmic storm.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Orbitals reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p url="https://youtu.be/bvMDXtgz1bo?si=K4MVfffSdJwn9PHT" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvMDXtgz1bo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Whether it's by using unique tools to open the path forward, piloting their spaceship through dangerous asteroid fields, or taking a break and soaking up the lavish anime-inspired atmosphere, players will embark on an intergalactic adventure and forge new bonds as friends together," a press release reads.</p><p>Orbitals is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and, because it's exclusive to Switch 2, will allow players to team up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Switch 2 console via local split-screen co-op. Plus, with Nintendo's GameShare feature, players can share Orbitals with a local player on another Switch 2 or Switch console, or matchmake online for remote co-op.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some additional Orbitals screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kepler Interactive says Shapefarm teamed up with Studio Massket, which is an anime studio behind series like <em>I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince so I Can Take My Time Perfecting My Magical Ability</em>, <em>Lycoris Recoil</em>, <em>Blue Lock</em>, and <em>Sasaki and Miyano</em>, to create bespoke cutscenes for Orbitals for an added layer of animation authenticity.&nbsp;</p><p>Orbitals will launch exclusively on Switch 2 sometime in 2026.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to check out Orbitals next year? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/12/orbitals-is-a-co-op-puzzle-adventure-inspired-by-classic-anime]]></content:encoded>
