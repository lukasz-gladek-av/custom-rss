<p>A <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260120899535/en/Hasbro-Announces-Additions-to-Board-of-Directors">press release from this morning</a> announced that Bowser and Carla Vernón (CEO of The Honest Company, Inc.) have been appointed to Hasbro's board of directors. The press release includes a statement from the board's current chair, Rich Stoddart, who says, "Doug and Carla bring extensive leadership experience across consumer brands and franchise management. Their expertise and guidance will be invaluable as Hasbro continues to execute its long-term innovation and growth strategy."</p><p>While Bowser himself likely won't be making headlines on <em>Game Informer </em>anymore, his influence will still be felt in the gaming space.
