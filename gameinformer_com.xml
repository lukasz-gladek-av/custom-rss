            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We haven't heard from TT Games, developers of the Lego games, since their release of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/embracing-the-light-and-dark-side">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> in 2022, but it turns out it's because they were hard at work building the next installment in their popular superhero series. Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was just announced at Gamescom's Opening Night Live.</p><p>While the Lego games were historically level-based journeys through a character's world, The Skywalker Saga broke that formula wide open with its release, creating a massive open world with character classes, improved vehicle controls, and new, original voice acting in addition to the dialogue from the films. Legacy of the Dark Knight seems to follow in that game's footsteps, featuring an open-world Gotham City and a bunch of references to past adaptations of the titular hero.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unlike other Lego games, which seem to either retell movie plots or create original stories, Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to split the difference, telling the story of Batman over the years with references to different chapters in his recent history. We see scenes from all three of Nolan's movies, a scene lifted straight from Matt Reeves' <em>The Batman</em>, and even references to the Arkham games, including what appears to be the series' explosive gel. These scenes are all re-voiced, however, to be more silly and fit the Lego style. When we see Bane from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, he's voiced by Matt Berry, rather than Tom Hardy.</p><p>The combat system has also been revamped to look more counter-based like the Arkham games, and the game will even include different difficulty levels – a first for the developer – for players who want a more challenging experience. While we only see the player playing as Batman in the revealed gameplay, Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, and Batgirl are also confirmed to be playable.</p><p>The game comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026. If you want to learn more, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wesleyleblanc.bsky.social/post/3lwrjsmbfdk2s">our senior associate editor Wesley LeBlanc</a> is on the ground in Germany for a hands-on preview, which you can expect to hear more about later this week.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-announced-includes-content-from]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The next entry in the long-running Call of Duty series is still aiming for its usual Fall release window. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will arrive on November 14, 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam and Battle.net.</p><p>Confirmed during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live stream, Black Ops 7 will feature the three pillars of Call of Duty: a campaign, multiplayer, and a PvE Zombies mode. Treyarch is partnering with Raven Software to add a little bit more onto each one of those pillars for Black Ops 7 in particular.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9txkGBj_trg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For one, the campaign will ultimately culminate in a new additional mission dubbed "Endgame," which mixes elements of extraction shooters and roguelikes into a giant map you'll have to slowly pick apart and uncover. Multiplayer is also getting a new 20 vs. 20 mode dubbed "Skirmish," wall jumps included with the series' Omnimovement, and 16 maps, including three returning Black Ops 2 locales.</p><p>A glimpse of this will be available from October 2 through 8, when Activision will be hosting the Black Ops 7 beta. Early Access will go live for preorders and "eligible" Game Pass subscribers on October 2, while the Open Beta portion starts later on October 5.</p><p>For more, check out our early preview of what's new for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year, including a mind-bending, fear-gassed campaign and a massive new arsenal, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/18/days-of-future-past">right here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arrives-on-november-14-beta-slated-for-october]]></content:encoded>
