            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Announced earlier this year, Pokémon Champions appears poised to become the successor to old favorites like Pokémon Stadium, but we haven't learned much about the game to this point. That changed today, thanks to a new trailer from The Pokémon Works, detailing some of what players should expect with the upcoming battle-focused title.</p><p>Similar to Pokémon Stadium, players can import the Pokémon caught on their mainline game journeys. This time, it's done through Pokémon Home. However, you can also recruit Pokémon to join their teams, including Trial Recruitments that allow Pokémon to join your team for a limited time. To permanently recruit a Pokémon, you must use Victory Points, earned through methods like winning Ranked Battles. Victory Points can also be used to train Pokémon and fine-tune their stats and moves.</p><p>Once you have your team, you can compete in Ranked Battles or Casual Battles against trainers around the world, or Private Battles against friends. Battles can also be traditional Single Battles or more chaotic Double Battles.&nbsp;</p><p>Pokémon Champions is set to arrive on Switch, iOS, and Android in 2026. If you'd rather not wait to get your battling fix, Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 are available on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library on Switch 2 and Switch, and Pokémon Colosseum is confirmed to come to the Switch 2 GameCube collection in the future.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2025/07/22/new-trailer-shares-more-info-about-pokemon-champions]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Every time there's a new Pokémon Presents livestream, we're reminded that there's a Pokémon mobile game for just about anything you can imagine. Sleeping, brushing your teeth, walking outside, you name it. Today's livestream added another app to this lineup -- <a href="https://www.pokemon-friends.jp/en/">Pokémon Friends</a>, a daily puzzle game for Switch and mobile. But while it looks like the other free games, it's a bit more complicated than that.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNJb21AX0-4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNJb21AX0-4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The trailer shows off a variety of simple puzzle formats, like one where you connect a line of lightbulbs in a single stroke, a slide puzzle where you direct water from one side of the screen to another, and a challenge where you rotate railroad tracks to create a path for a cart. When you complete puzzles, you get in-game plushes of Pokémon you can use to decorate some in-game rooms. According to the game's listing on the iOS App Store, the game has "over 1,200 puzzles" as well as "up to five save files," so families can have separate progress on a shared device. The trailer shows kids of all ages playing, including with their parents, so it seems to be geared towards a slightly younger audience.</p><p>However, while the game is free to download on mobile devices, it costs $9.99 on Switch in the United States. The FAQ section of the official Pokémon Friends site breaks it down; essentially, <a href="https://www.pokemon-friends.jp/en/dlc/">the Switch version comes with the Basic Pack</a>, a DLC bundle that allows players to do an unlimited number of puzzles per day. You can purchase the Basic Pack on mobile as well, but it's a base feature of the Switch version. <a href="https://www.pokemon-friends.jp/en/dlc/lineup/">There are also two more DLC options</a> – Puzzle On Pack #1 and #1 – that are available to buy from day one as standalone packages or in bundles.</p><p>It's a confusing monetization system, but it seems like if you just want to give the game a try, you should download the free version on mobile before committing to the console version. The game is out today on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-friends/id6741408067">the App Store</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonfriends">the Google Play store</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2025/07/22/pokemon-friends-is-out-today-for-free-on-mobile-but-10-on-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today's Pokémon Presents, we learned more about the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-october-release-date-switch-2-edition-upgrade-confirmed">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> through a new trailer. Framed through the Nintendo Switch 2 Version, we learned a lot about the story, characters, and boss battles players will be able to participate in within this version of Lumiose City.</p><p>In the new trailer, we learn about the strange anomaly that players will investigate, where wild Pokémon are Mega Evolving and causing trouble. These Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon lose control and appear to play out as boss battles, similar to the Frenzied Nobles in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. In the Pokémon Presents trailer, it shows a battle against a Rogue Mega Evolved Tyranitar. You can even Mega Evolve your own Pokémon, including the new Mega Evolution of Dragonite, and it looks like you can fight alongside another trainer in these boss battles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Lumiose City strives to be for both people and Pokémon. During the day, you can traverse the city, catching Pokémon and exploring. However, at night, the strongest trainers emerge to battle to improve their rankings and advance in the Z-A Royale. Team MZ is formed to protect Lumiose and consists of fashion designer Naveen, dancer Lida, and others. Your player character appears to join Team MZ to help with its mission. We also see the Rust Syndicate, the team that undoubtedly serves as your rival, led by Corbeau, who also appears to have business with Team MZ.&nbsp;</p><p>While not battling, you can explore, customize your character's looks and outfit, and even give your Furfrou a haircut. You can also take photos with your Pokémon or relax at a café. Along the way, you can help Emma, a detective in Lumiose City, assist Mable, the director of the Pokémon Research Lab, with her research, and complete side objectives for other characters around the city.&nbsp;</p><p>There's still much we don't know about Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but we're excited to learn more in the lead up to it arriving on Switch 2 and Switch on October 16.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2025/07/22/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-details-supporting-characters-and-mega]]></content:encoded>
