            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>, the god-simulator from Fable creator Peter Molyneux, launches on April 22, and ahead of the game's PC release, developer 22 Cans has released nearly seven minutes of all-new gameplay in an extended trailer. The game, which puts players in control of a god-like hand to master real-time strategy, town management, and simulation, also lets players become one of their villages' many NPCs to explore, fight, explore dungeons, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a taste of all that and more in the new trailer, and you can check it out below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," the trailer's description reads. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In Masters of Albion, there is no single solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, wherever. Kill or carry, crush or coax. You are the ultimate power."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Masters of Albion will be Molyneux's final game, as he and 22 Cans said <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB&amp;v=CSLGKKAuZwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">when the team announced it during Gamescom 2024</a>. Molyneux, who is the mind behind Populous and Black and White, as well as Fable (the original), said Masters of Albion is "the culmination of my life's work" back when the game was first announced.&nbsp;</p>
