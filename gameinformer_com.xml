            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Wemade Max Co. and developer Madngine have released the first official trailer for Project Tal, a single-player, open-world action RPG inspired by Korean mythology. Though this trailer looks great, don't get too excited yet because the game is targeting a console and PC release sometime in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>Madngine says Project Tal "reimagined Korea's traditional Tal masks," as well as the mythology and Korean folklore that surrounds these special masks. It infuses this mythology into a fantasy open world for players to explore, and today's trailer showcases some of that world alongside the fast-paced action combat against huge monsters and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Project Tal announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see in the trailer, Project Tal features a companion system that ensures players aren't fighting alone in this dangerous world. Madngine says the companion system "dynamically responds to the player's combat style and environment" in a press release. Each NPC companion has unique abilities, combat roles, including up-close and ranged magic and melee prowess, and distinctive personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>"Project Tal combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG," Wemade Max Co. CEO Sohn Myun-seok writes in a press release. "With Madngine's technical expertise and artistic vision, we're creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage."</p><p>We'll have to wait until 2027 when Project Tal hits unspecified consoles and PC to see if that's the case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some additional Project Tal screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/11/nexon-unveils-woochi-the-wayfarer-a-single-player-korean-fantasy-action-adventure-game">read about Woochi the Wayfarer</a>, another single-player Korean fantasy action game in development, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4/relentless-exhausting-exhilarating"><em>Game Informer's </em>Ninja Gaiden 4 review</a> to find out why it's an action game we recommend you check out. &nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of our first official look at Project Tal?
