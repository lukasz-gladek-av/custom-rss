            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo has announced today intentions to air a partner showcase tomorrow morning at 1 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET. We shouldn't expect any first-party news, but there will probably be lots of Switch 2 third-party announcements. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2024/02/21/everything-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">A Nintendo Partner showcase from early last year</a> shared games like Epic Mickey Rebrushed, Grounded on Switch, and a few Rare titles also came to Nintendo's Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 Nintendo Online platforms.</p><blockquote><p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1950541896012493166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><p>My hope is that Nintendo surprise announces and releases some new third-party GameCube games. I would also love to learn more about From Software's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/the-duskbloods-from-softwares-next-game-is-a-switch-2-exclusive">The Duskbloods</a>, but I am not holding my breath.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gZoLrfLcIVg">You can watch the Showcase here tomorrow</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/30/nintendo-is-holding-a-partner-showcase-tomorrow]]></content:encoded>
