            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Since its announcement in 2017, we have been patiently waiting for Witchbrook, the next game from Chucklefish. You might recognize them as the developers known for Starbound and Wargroove, but they also published big indie hits like Stardew Valley, giving us plenty of reasons to be excited. Luckily, the latest Nintendo Direct not only gave us a fresh look at the magically collegiate adventure but also gave us a launch window: holiday 2025.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWDGCwFZMbk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Witchbrook is a cozy life-sim where players embody a student at the titular magical college. As you take classes and learn spells, you'll be able to bring them into other areas of life, like selling magical decorations at a stand in the town square. Players can also explore the town of Mossport to get jobs, make money, and meet up with their friends. It's all showcased through a cute, isometric, pixelated art style.</p>

<p>The trailer featured cozy mechanics galore. In addition to the aforementioned shop mechanic, you can use a telescope to read the stars, deliver mail to townsfolk, and rearrange your living quarters by using levitation spells to move furniture. The game also supports up to 4-player online co-op, which the new video showcases through footage of four people flying across the town on their brooms. At a different point, we see someone also driving a moped, which seems objectively inferior to a flying broom, but I'll leave the magic to the students of Witchbrook.</p>

<p>A moped? Really?</p>

</article><p>While the trailer was specifically for the Switch version, the game is also headed to Xbox and PC. You can take classes, learn spells, and socialize with your fellow students on the platform of your choice when Witchbrook launches this holiday season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-battle-zones-and-the-z-a-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After the Pokémon Presents earlier this year, we got our first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A, including gameplay, new characters, and the game's selection of starters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9OqoRxXUjGA">Today's Nintendo Direct</a> gave us just a bit more information, specifically explaining what the deal was with the mysterious teaser at the end of the previous trailers.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A is the second of a new style of mainline Pokémon games, with a free third-person camera, an open world, and revamped combat. While Legends Arceus took place in an ancient Sinnoh region, Legends Z-A is a return to the Kalos region from Pokémon X&amp;Y, allowing players to see what happened after that game's campaign. Given that those titles are the only mainline Pokémon games without sequels or DLC, it's been a highly anticipated return.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tezs2FsIxgA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes place entirely within Lumiose City, a huge Paris-like metropolis with multiple districts. Wild Pokémon will now appear in Wild Zones, closed-off areas within the city where the creatures are able to live peaceful lives undisturbed. While this feature appeared in the Pokémon Presents trailer, we only saw what the areas were like during the day. Today's Nintendo Direct revealed they're a bit different once the sun goes down.</p>

<p>At night, Battle Zones appear. While Wild Zones have an inviting green entrance, the Battle Zones are an aggressive red-orange and are full of trainers looking for challengers. Collectively, these encounters are known as the Z-A Royale, a competition where a trainer makes their way from Rank Z to Rank A. Rules here are similar to other games – eye contact with a trainer forces you into a battle – but the new action-based battle system allows for alternate approaches too, like the ability to ambush a trainer with an attack before they see you.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6e7b3bea-04e4-45bc-91f0-8f11d4375674" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Reach Rank A, and you'll "have a wish granted," though it's not entirely clear who grants the wish and how far their powers go. Examples in the trailer include a taxi driver hoping to abolish all public transit except taxis and a woman hoping the city will host a marathon, so don't go into it expecting to solve world hunger or anything.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Battle Zones raises many questions. When you lose, do you drop ranks? How often can we battle in the daylight, outside of Battle Zones? Who's hosting the Z-A Royale to begin with? We'll have answers once Pokémon Legends Z-A drops on Switch in late 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gameplay-trailer-reveals-samus-new-psychic-powers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond made its presence known during today’s Nintendo Direct with its first gameplay demonstration. Today’s trailer reveals a new world Samus unexpectedly finds herself in, the first extended look at combat, and a brand-new suite of powers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer unfolded on planet Viewros, a planet of lush jungles including a colossal tree at its center, not unlike Pandora from the Avatar films. To learn more about her surroundings, we see Samus use her trusty scanner to glean information on fauna and flora, some of which, believe it or not, are hostile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first-person gunplay looks familiar but polished like never before. In addition to blasting new alien threats and killer plants with her cannon, Beyond sees Samus become augmented by an ancient force granting her new Psychic powers.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmwAhBxakw4" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>These powers grant her telekinetic-like abilities, allowing her to manipulate mechanisms with her mind. We see her turning what looks to be a giant clock hand by simply waving her hand, for example. In combat, Samus can now psychically guide her arm cannon’s projectiles to her targets, essentially turning them into homing blasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer concludes with a tantalizing tease of a new red and black suit for Samus, but we’ll have to wait and see what abilities accompany her new armor. Unfortunately, Nintendo didn’t reveal a release date, but Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is slated to launch for Switch later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything Announced At The Dreamhaven Showcase]]></title>
            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/26/everything-announced-at-the-dreamhaven-showcase</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-announced-at-the-dreamhaven-showcase.1147140/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/26/everything-announced-at-the-dreamhaven-showcase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/09/23/mike-morhaime-launches-dreamhaven-with-other-blizzard-veterans">Dreamhaven</a>, a publisher founded in 2020 by Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime, held its first showcase yesterday detailing updates for a handful of titles from its studios. The publisher was formed alongside other Blizzard alumni to “create and publish original games for players around the world." To that end, it established two internal studios, Secret Door and Moonshot Games, which consist of industry veterans hailing from Blizzard and beyond. Today’s showcase sees Dreamhaven roll the carpet out for their upcoming slate of games in a big way, and if you missed the event live, here’s a quick round-up of notable announcements.</p>

<h2>Wildgate Announced by Moonshot Games</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2jvZzieaBo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Freshly unveiled for the first time, Wildgate is the space-faring debut title by Moonshot Games. Described as a crew-based first-person shooter, players (called Prospectors) work together as a ship crew to explore a mysterious region of space to steal a powerful artifact called, well, the Artifact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each crew pilots a ship, which takes different shapes and sizes and can be customized with various guns and gadgets. Each crew member sports unique tools and skills, and success depends on how well players cooperate to keep the ship running effectively. That includes jobs like piloting the ship, salvaging loot and resources, and engaging in space combat with hostile aliens and rival treasure hunters. The crew that retrieves the Artifact must race to an exit gate to successfully escape with it. Alternatively, you can also opt to annihilate all rival ships to be the last crew standing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wildgate launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this year. You can sign up now for a community playtest taking place on April 10-14.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sunderfolk Gets A Release Date&nbsp;</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rre2LkxZjDQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>First announced last October, Sunderfolk aims to streamline the tabletop RPG experience. Up to four players assume the roles of heroes to protect a peaceful animal village from encroaching corruption using their phones or tablets as controllers. This ensures everyone can play, and the lack of physical materials (resources like the rulebook are accessed in the Sunderfolk mobile app) aims to get the party adventuring as quickly and painlessly as possible. Additionally, only the host needs to own the game; everyone else can join in for free.</p>

<p>Featuring six classes to choose from – Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, and Rogue – players can outfit themselves with weapons, armor, skills, and items to face enemies in turn-based tactical battles. Players execute commands using a customizable card deck, and battles encourage cooperation and strategy. Between fights, players will upgrade the village of Arden to add new vendors and cultivate relationships with its residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curious players can try Sunderfolk now via a free demo, though you’ll have to sign up with NVIDIA GeForce Now to access it. Sunderfolk launches on April 23 for $49.99 and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Lynked: Banner of the Spark Goes 1.0 This May</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozF5rFIR4Ck" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark launched into Steam Early Access last October, and developer FuzzyBot is preparing to bring it to prime time in a couple of months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This action RPG can be played solo or in co-op and combines roguelite progression with cozy city-building. Players hack ‘n’ slash through waves of robotic enemies, harvest their parts, and then use those materials to expand a home base. When you’re not fighting, you can engage in more laid-back activities at the hub like fishing, harvesting crops, collecting animals, and crafting home decor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1.0 version will introduce five new chapters, bringing the main campaign up to a total of 40 missions. A new biome, The VoidSpyre, will be introduced along with five new bosses. New weapon mods and skins will also become available for crafting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark arrives on May 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dreamhaven announced a publishing partnership for Mechabellum, a mech-themed tactics game that launched last September. A premium edition of the game launches today with over 18 exclusive skins, avatars, and emotes. This version runs for $29.99 versus the previous standard edition’s $14.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/26/soccer-legend-cristiano-ronaldo-is-a-playable-fighter-in-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Fighting games have long established a trend of including guest characters on their rosters. Whether you’re talking about Akuma appearing in Tekken 7, Yoda showing up in Soulcalibur IV, or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being added as DLC in Injustice 2, guest characters are nothing new for this genre. However, with the announcement of soccer legend Cristiano Ronaldo joining its main roster, the upcoming Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves makes a strong case for hosting one of the more unique and unpredictable guest inclusions.</p>

<p>Widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players to ever step foot on the pitch, holding various individual records and titles, Ronaldo joins the main playable roster of Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Representing his native Portugal in international play, Ronaldo has spent large portions of his career playing for Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. He joined Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia in 2023, where he has played since.</p>

<p>In Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, Ronaldo is voiced by Juan Felipe Sierra. In-game, Ronaldo uses techniques he developed during his career as a footballer to punish his opponents, with his fighting style listed as, “Football + Martial Arts.” You can see how this style plays out through the reveal trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbeEWm4_qeg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Ronaldo’s inclusion brings the current main roster size to 15, though that number could still grow en route to next month’s launch. Additionally, we know DLC is on the horizon, as SNK announced last year that two other guest characters, Ken and Chun-Li from the Street Fighter series, will join the roster after launch. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 24. If you’d like to familiarize yourself with other playable Fatal Fury characters before then, Mai Shiranui and Terry Bogard joined the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of downloadable content over the course of 2024.</p>
