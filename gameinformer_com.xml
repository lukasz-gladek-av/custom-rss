<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">State of Play</a> will stream on PlayStation's various YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, that's anybody's guess. On the first-party front, PlayStation's Housemarque studio is launching <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/saros">Saros</a> in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026">April, after a delay from its original March date</a>; Insomniac Games is releasing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, which is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/10/27/wolverine-game-set-in-the-same-universe-as-marvels-spider-man-insomniac-confirms">set in the same universe as the studio's Spider-Man games</a>, sometime this year as well, so there's a good chance we'll see both of these games on Thursday.&nbsp;</p><p>On the third-party front, nobody would be surprised to see more <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which has been closely aligned with PlayStation on marketing, and given Capcom's history with its prior Resident Evil games, there's a chance we get a Requiem demo – both Biohazard and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/01/21/resident-evil-village-ps5-exclusive-demo-drops-today-alongside-new-video">Village received demos prior to launch</a>. Capcom could also appear with another look at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/pragmata">Pragmata</a> before its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/pragmata-comes-to-switch-2-and-other-platforms-next-april-and-a">April release</a>, and we also expect to see various other third-party and indie games as well.&nbsp;</p><p>With over an hour promised of news and updates, this will likely be one of PlayStation's biggest showcases of the year.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Let us know what you want to see at the PlayStation State of Play in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/psa/2026/02/09/state-of-play-announced-for-this-week-will-feature-over-an-hour-of-third-party-indie]]></content:encoded>
